"As a subtraction and multiplication expert, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. To find out how many eggs she has left after using some for breakfast and baking, we need to subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid. The number of eggs used is 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7.

Now, let's perform the subtraction: 16 - 7 = 9. This means Janet has 9 eggs left.

Next, we need to find out how much she makes by selling these eggs. Since she sells each egg for $2, we'll multiply the number of eggs left by the selling price: 9 * 2 = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The problem states that 2 bolts of blue fiber are required, and the amount of white fiber is half that amount.

Let's represent the amount of white fiber as a fraction of the blue fiber. Since the white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber, we can express it as:

White fiber = 2 bolts * (1/2) = 2 * (1/2) = 1 bolt

Now, we can add the blue and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 2 + 1 = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To calculate the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh invested $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we can use the formula:

New value = Original value + (Original value * Increase percentage)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = Original price + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"The art of multiplication. A fundamental operation that governs the very fabric of our universe. In this case, we're tasked with calculating the total distance James covers in a week by running 3 sprints, 3 times a week, with each sprint spanning 60 meters.

To solve this problem, we'll employ the distributive property of multiplication, which states that the product of a number and a sum is equal to the sum of the products. In this case, we have:

Total distance = (Number of sprints per session) × (Distance per sprint) × (Number of sessions per week)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Total distance = 3 × 60 × 3

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the order of the factors to facilitate easier calculation:

Total distance = (3 × 3) × 60

Now, we can perform the multiplication:

3 × 3 = 9

So, the equation becomes:

Total distance = 9 × 60

Multiplying 9 by 60, we get:

9 × 60 = 540

Therefore, James covers a total distance of 540 meters in a week.

The final answer is: 540"
"When it comes to solving multi-step arithmetic word problems, I always start by breaking down the information provided and identifying the key elements involved. In this case, we're dealing with Wendi's chicken feed distribution.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon. This can be done by adding the morning and afternoon feed amounts:

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Next, we need to determine the total number of cups of feed required per meal. Since each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 20 chickens in the flock, we can calculate the total feed needed per meal as follows:

Total feed per meal = 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 3 * 20 = 60 cups

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal:

Total feed needed per meal - Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 60 - 40 = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we can use a geometric series formula. The first term (a) is $5, and the common ratio (r) is 0.6. We want to find the sum of the first 16 terms.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get: S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)

First, we calculate 0.6^16:

"The problem at hand involves determining the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can establish a foundation for our calculations.

First, we know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. To find the number of sheep in Charleston, we multiply the number of sheep in Seattle by 4:

4 × 20 = 80

Now, we're informed that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2:

2 × 80 = 160

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:

160 + 80 + 20 = 260

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"When dealing with interrupted downloads, it's essential to consider the time spent on the initial download, the interruption time, and the time required to restart the download. In this scenario, Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file, which is interrupted by the Windows update installation. The time spent on the initial download is given by:

t1 = (0.4 * 200 GB) / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

The interruption time is 20 minutes, and the remaining 60% of the file needs to be downloaded from the beginning. The time required to download the remaining 60% of the file is:

t2 = (0.6 * 200 GB) / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Since Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, the total time is the sum of the initial download time, the interruption time, and the time required to download the remaining 60% of the file:

t_total = t1 + 20 minutes + t2
t_total = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes
t_total = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

Let's break down the trip into segments:

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

2. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Distance = Speed * Time
Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

4. Distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled in the return trip:
Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

However, we need to consider the time John spent in standstill traffic as part of the total time. Since he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, we need to subtract this time from the total time to find the remaining time for the return trip:
Total time for the return trip = 4 hours
Time spent in standstill traffic = 2 hours
Remaining time for the return trip = 4 - 2 = 2 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the remaining time at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

However, we already calculated this distance in step 4. To find the correct distance traveled in the remaining time, we need to consider the distance traveled in the first half-hour at 30 mph as part of the total distance traveled in the return trip. Since we already calculated this distance in step 3, we can subtract it from the total distance traveled in the return trip to find the correct distance traveled in the remaining time:
Total distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles
Distance traveled in the first half-hour at 30 mph = 15 miles
Distance traveled in the remaining time = 175 - 15 = 160 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled in the return trip:
Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of standstill traffic = 0 miles
Distance traveled in the first half-hour at 30 mph = 15 miles
Distance traveled in the remaining time = 160 miles
Total distance traveled in the return trip = 0 + 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Initial distance from home = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

However, if we are looking for the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"Calculating overtime pay is a straightforward process that involves determining the regular pay and the overtime pay, then adding them together. 

First, we need to calculate Eliza's regular pay for the first 40 hours. Her regular hourly rate is $10, so her regular pay is 40 * $10 = $400.

Next, we need to calculate her overtime pay. Since she worked 45 hours, the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

To find her total earnings, we add her regular pay and overtime pay together: $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 × 60 = 180 downloads.

To find the downloads in the third month, we need to reduce the second month's downloads by 30%. To do this, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 

30% of 180 is 0.3 × 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"The art of calculating the total cost of pastries. A task that requires precision and a deep understanding of multiplication and addition. As an expert in these mathematical operations, I can assure you that the process is quite straightforward.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry. The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 × $68 = $204. This is a simple application of the multiplication operation, where we multiply the quantity (3 dozen) by the cost per dozen ($68).

Next, we calculate the cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes: 2 × $80 = $160. Again, a straightforward application of multiplication.

Lastly, we determine the cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes: 6 × $55 = $330. Another instance of multiplication, where we multiply the quantity (6 dozen) by the cost per dozen ($55).

Now, to find the total cost, we add the costs of each type of pastry together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to perform a break-even analysis. This involves finding the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the annual cost to maintain the tree is $3. The revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

The total cost can be represented as $90 + $3x, and the total revenue is $10.5x.

To find the break-even point, we set the total cost equal to the total revenue and solve for x:

$90 + $3x = $10.5x

Subtracting $3x from both sides gives us:

$90 = $7.5x

Dividing both sides by $7.5 gives us:

x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

This means it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself. However, since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we need to consider the first year as the year it starts earning money.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: 12"
"When solving word problems involving fractions, it's essential to break down the information provided and work backwards to find the solution. In this case, we're given that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. We're also told that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as x. After selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

Selling 2 more at the red house leaves her with (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners. Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

Now, we're given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us x = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is calculated as 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Now, we need to find the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of the remaining 16 students is calculated as 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance is 4 + 4 = 8 students. To find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract this from the total number of students: 20 - 8 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the optimal purchase choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item.

The increase in value for the jewelry is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = \text{Initial value} \times \text{Percentage increase} \]
\[ \text{Increase in value of jewelry} = \$5,000 \times 2.5\% = \$5,000 \times 0.025 = \$125 \]

The increase in value for the electronic gadgets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = \text{Initial value} \times \text{Percentage increase} \]
\[ \text{Increase in value of electronic gadgets} = \$8,000 \times 1.2\% = \$8,000 \times 0.012 = \$96 \]

Comparing the increases in value, we can see that the jewelry will increase in value by $125, which is greater than the $96 increase in value for the electronic gadgets. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Given the scenario, we have two trains traveling in a two-dimensional plane, with one axis representing the westward direction and the other axis representing the northward direction. The trains travel 80 miles westward on the first day and 150 miles northward on the second day.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, the two sides are the distances traveled westward and northward.

Let's denote the distance traveled westward as a = 80 miles and the distance traveled northward as b = 150 miles. The total distance covered by each train is the length of the hypotenuse, c.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:

c² = a² + b²
c² = 80² + 150²
c² = 6400 + 22500
c² = 28900
c = √28900
c = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time frame. 

First, we calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks: 4 weeks * 7 days/week = 28 days.

Next, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day: 28 days * 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed at which Marissa must walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

Let's break down the information given:

- Marissa has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours.
- She wants to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

First, we need to find the total time she needs to complete the hike to achieve the desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, then subtract the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter of orange drink.

First, let's find the amount of water in the orange drink. Since it is two-thirds water, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{2}{3}$. To find the amount of water in 10 liters of the orange drink, we multiply this fraction by 10:

$$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 10 = \frac{20}{3}$$

To simplify this fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. However, we can also express this fraction as a decimal for easier calculation: $\frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67$ liters.

Next, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{3}{5}$. To find the amount of water in 15 liters of the pineapple drink, we multiply this fraction by 15:

$$\frac{3}{5} \cdot 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9$$

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink. We add the amount of water in the orange drink to the amount of water in the pineapple drink:

$$6.67 + 9 = 15.67$$

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract the amount of water in this 1 liter from the total amount of water:

$$15.67 - 1 = 14.67$$

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is $24 - 14.67 = 9.33$ liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is $(1/3) \cdot 9.33 = 3.11$ liters. Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is $(2/5) \cdot 9.33 = 3.732$ liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is $14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512$ liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to calculate the difference between the current year and the year Raymond had his son.

However, we still don't know the current year. But we can calculate the difference between Samantha's age and the year Raymond had his son to find the number of years that have passed since then.

Difference = Samantha's age - Year Raymond had his son
Difference = 31 - 23
Difference = 8

Since we are looking for how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the difference from the current year. However, we still don't know the current year. But we can calculate the difference between the year Raymond had his son and the year Samantha was born to find the number of years that have passed since then.

Year Samantha was born = Samantha's age - Difference
Year Samantha was born = 31 - 8
Year Samantha was born = 23

Now, we can calculate the year Raymond had his son relative to the year Samantha was born.

Year Raymond had his son = Year Samantha was born - "
"The task at hand is a simple arithmetic problem involving multiplication and addition. To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, so they buy a total of 3 × 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 2 × 2 = 4 DVDs.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total melting of a candle over a specified time period. Given that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total melting by multiplying the rate by the total time.

To find the total time, we need to determine the duration from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. This is a straightforward calculation:

Total time = 5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the total melting by multiplying the rate by the total time:

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"When calculating the original price of an item after a discount, it's essential to understand the concept of percentage-based discounts. In this case, we're dealing with a 25% discount, which means the discounted price is 75% of the original price.

Given that the discounted price is $19.50, we can express this as 0.75x, where x is the original price. To find the original price, we need to solve for x.

We can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To isolate x, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

x = 26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza as x.

The total cost of the items can be represented as:

12 (cost of chicken meal) + 5 * 3 (cost of milk) + 4 * 1.5 (cost of apples) + 8.5x (cost of pizza boxes) = 50 (total amount paid)

Combine like terms and simplify the equation:

12 + 15 + 6 + 8.5x = 50

Combine the constants:

33 + 8.5x = 50

Subtract 33 from both sides:

8.5x = 17

Divide both sides by 8.5:

x = 17 / 8.5
x = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts: 3 × $16.50 = $49.50

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pants: 3 × $22.50 = $67.50

Now, we'll calculate the cost of the shoes: 3 × $42 = $126

Finally, we'll add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

The total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is $243."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia, we need to calculate the number of cartons she will purchase and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Given that Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night for 60 days, we can calculate the total number of cartons required by dividing the total number of days by the number of servings per carton.

Total number of cartons = Total number of days / Number of servings per carton
= 60 days / 15 servings per carton
= 60/15
= 4

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton.

Total cost = Number of cartons * Cost per carton
= 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton
= 4 × $4.00
= $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"The art of subtraction. A fundamental operation that requires precision and attention to detail. In this case, we're tasked with finding the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops during his 60-mile bike trip.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the distances involved. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means the second stop was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, to find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. However, we can also approach this by finding the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip and then subtracting that from the total distance to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

In this case, the distance between the first and second stops is simply the difference between the two distances. This is a straightforward application of the subtraction operation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"When solving word problems involving linear equations, it's essential to carefully read and interpret the given information. In this scenario, Gloria is faced with a decision between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. We're told that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots, and one pair of heels costs $33, while the other costs twice as much.

Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can express the cost of the more expensive pair as 2 * 33 = $66.

We can now set up an equation to represent the situation: B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Given the ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7:11, we can express their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant. The total of their ages is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms to simplify the equation: 18x = 162

To solve for x, divide both sides by 18: x = 162 / 18 = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: $\frac{80}{2} = 40$, so the second person guesses $40 + 20 = 60$ jelly beans.

The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: $80 \times 0.25 = 20$, so the third person guesses $80 + 20 = 100$ jelly beans.

To find the total number of guesses, we add the individual guesses: $80 + 60 + 100 = 240$.

There are 3 people. To find the average, we divide the total number of guesses by the number of people: $\frac{240}{3} = 80$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"As a multiplication expert, I can tell you that the problem at hand is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication. To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog and then multiply the result by the number of days in a week.

Let's break it down:

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs × Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 × 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we need to multiply the total time per day by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Total time per week = Total time per day × 7
Total time per week = 5 × 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

Therefore, the correct answer is 35 hours.

The final answer is: 35"
"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations:

1. G = S + 30 (Equation 1)
2. S + G = 110 (Equation 2)

We can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use substitution. Rearranging Equation 1 to isolate S, we get S = G - 30.

Substituting S = G - 30 into Equation 2, we get:

(G - 30) + G = 110

Combine like terms: 2G - 30 = 110.

Add 30 to both sides: 2G = 140.

Divide both sides by 2: G = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as R, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Siobhan has as S.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = 5 + (1/2)R (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

Substituting the value of R from equation 1 into equation 2, we get:

A = 5 + (1/2)(40)
A = 5 + 20
A = 25

Now, substitute the value of A into equation 3 to find S:

S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To calculate the total points Mike scored, we need to determine the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

To find the points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points. To do this, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is equivalent to 4 × 0.25 = 1 point. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total cost of yogurts Terry eats over 30 days, we need to calculate the number of sets of yogurts he purchases and then multiply that by the cost per set.

First, let's find the number of sets of yogurts Terry buys. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, in 30 days, he consumes 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Given that the yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we can find the number of sets by dividing the total yogurts consumed by the number of yogurts per set: 60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set to find the total cost: 15 sets * $5.00 per set = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets:
13 Lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we need to find out how much money John spent on video games:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, we know John had $5 left after buying the video games. This means he spent a total of $195 - $5 = $190 from the Lego sales.

Since John spent $160 on video games, he must have used $190 - $160 = $30 of his own money to buy the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $30:
$30 / $15 per set = 2

This means John sold 2 Lego sets with his own money. Since he sold a total of 13 Lego sets, he must have sold the remaining 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total running time. John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days, which is 1.5 hours each. So, the total running time for the three days is:

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
Total running time = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time:
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 18 hours
Speed = 3.33 miles per hour

Therefore, John's running speed is 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"Given the problem, let's break it down into a system of equations involving rates, distances, and time. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Let's denote Dana's walking speed as w. Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we have the equation:

6 = 4w

Solving for w, we get:

w = 6/4 = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, let's consider the time she spends walking and running. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If the total time is 6 hours, then the time spent walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time spent running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

Let's denote the distance she travels while walking as d_w and the distance she travels while running as d_r. We can set up the following equations:

d_w = w * t_w
d_r = r * t_r

where w is her walking speed, t_w is the time spent walking, r is her running speed, and t_r is the time spent running.

Substituting the values we know, we get:

d_w = 1.5 * 4
d_r = 6 * 2

Simplifying, we get:

d_w = 6
d_r = 12

The total distance she can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances traveled while walking and running:

d_total = d_w + d_r
= 6 + 12
= 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"The problem at hand involves a series of multiplicative relationships between the ages of three individuals' iPhones. Given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we can establish a foundation for our calculations.

To find Ben's iPhone age, we apply the concept of multiplication, as it is stated that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. This relationship can be expressed as:

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
= 2 * 1
= 2 years

Now, we are told that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. We can represent this relationship using the same multiplicative principle:

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
= 4 * 2
= 8 years

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"As a master of multiplication and subtraction, I'm delighted to tackle this problem. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her javelin-throwing distance triples. To find the new distance, I'll apply the multiplication principle.

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 3 × 400 = 1200 feet

Now, to determine how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand, I'll subtract the dragon's reach from the new distance.

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"The problem at hand involves determining the number of pie pieces taken by the guests. To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of pie pieces initially available and then subtract the number of pieces remaining.

First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces: 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Next, we subtract the number of remaining pieces: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pie pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the daily calorie allowance for a 300g bag of chips, we first need to calculate the remaining calories available for consumption. Given a daily target of 2000 calories and a current consumption of 1800 calories, the remaining calories can be calculated as follows:

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (current consumption) = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, we can determine the number of servings that can be consumed within the remaining calorie allowance:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag of chips contains 5 servings. To find the weight of chips that can be consumed, we can multiply the number of servings by the weight of the bag:

0.8 servings * 300g (weight of the bag) = 240g

Therefore, the weight of chips that can be consumed is 240g.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the cost per candle. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, the cost per candle is the total cost of supplies divided by the number of candles made from 1 pound of beeswax.

Cost per candle = Cost of supplies / Number of candles made from 1 pound of beeswax
Cost per candle = $10.00 / 10
Cost per candle = $1.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.

Total cost = Number of candles sold * Cost per candle
Total cost = 20 * $1.00
Total cost = $20.00

Finally, we can calculate the net profit.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

First, let's find the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, we can express this as:

2/5 * 5 + 5 = (2/5) * 5 + 5
= 2 + 5
= 7 articles

Now, we know she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday. To find the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday, we can multiply this by 2, since she wrote twice the number of articles on Wednesday as on Tuesday:

2 * 7 = 14 articles

Now, we can find the total number of articles written in 3 days by adding the number of articles written on each day:

5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased as x.

"Given that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties and the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can establish a relationship between the number of blue ties (B) and the number of red ties (R) as R = 2B.

We are also given that the cost of each blue tie is $40. Let's denote the cost of each red tie as x. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can express this as x = 1.5 * 40 = $60.

Now, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties. This can be represented as 40B = 200, which implies B = 5.

Given that R = 2B, we can find the number of red ties as R = 2 * 5 = 10.

The total cost of red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches by multiplying the number of feet by 12.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we first calculate the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor: $15 \times 8 = 120$ units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: $120 \times \frac{1}{4} = 30$ units.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert that to dozens, as eggs are sold by the dozen.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs produced per week by multiplying the daily egg production by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 252 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 1764 \, \text{eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12 (the number of eggs in a dozen):
\[ 1764 \, \text{eggs/week} \div 12 \, \text{eggs/dozen} = 147 \, \text{dozens/week} \]

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find Lloyd's weekly earnings:
\[ 147 \, \text{dozens/week} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294/\text{week} \]

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

First, let's calculate the time it took to travel from 1 to 4 PM. Since Tom's ship can travel at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, but we need to convert this to miles. Since the speed is given in miles per hour, we can assume the distance is also in miles. Therefore, the distance is 3 miles (assuming a constant speed of 10 miles per hour).

Time = 3 miles / 10 miles per hour = 0.3 hours

However, this is not the correct approach. The distance from 1 to 4 PM is actually 3 hours, and we need to convert this to miles. Since the speed is 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time
3 hours = 10 miles per hour × Time
Time = 3 hours / 10 miles per hour = 0.3 hours

However, this is the time in hours, and we need to convert it to a more meaningful unit. Since the time of day is given in hours and minutes, we can convert 0.3 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:

0.3 hours × 60 minutes per hour = 18 minutes

However, this is still not the correct approach. The time from 1 to 4 PM is actually 3 hours, and we need to calculate the distance traveled during this time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles per hour × 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now that we have the correct distance, we can calculate the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and the speed is 6 miles per hour. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

The total time Tom spent traveling is the sum of the time it took to travel from 1 to 4 PM and the time it took to travel back:

Total Time = 3 hours + 5 hours
Total Time = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, we can multiply the number of comic books by their weight:

30 × (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to reach a total weight of 15 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the number of toys to be removed. Then, the total weight of the toys is x × (1/2) = x/2 pounds.

We know that the total weight of the toys and comic books should be 15 pounds, so we can set up the equation:

7.5 + x/2 = 15

To solve for x, we can subtract 7.5 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 15 - 7.5
x/2 = 7.5

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x:

x = 7.5 × 2
x = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"As a multiplication expert, I can quickly calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on both Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is calculated as 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, and since no truck tires were repaired, the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.

To determine which day had higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Clearly, Thursday's revenue is higher.

Now, to find the difference in revenue between the two days, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has. To do this, we need to consider the number of adopted kittens and the new kittens from the two house cats.

First, let's calculate the number of kittens from the adopted cats. The Doubtfire sisters have 7 adopted kittens. 

Next, we need to determine the number of kittens from the two house cats. Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which is 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens, we add the number of adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens: 7 + 21 + 12.

7 + 21 = 28
28 + 12 = 40

The total number of kittens is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"When it comes to division and subtraction, I'm delighted to apply my expertise to this problem. 

To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to perform two operations: subtraction and division. 

First, we subtract the number of lollipops Jean ate from the total number of lollipops. This is a straightforward subtraction problem:

30 (initial lollipops) - 2 (lollipops eaten) = 28

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill. This is a division problem, and I'll perform it with precision:

28 ÷ 2 = 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops in each bag.

The final answer is: 14"
"As a division expert, I can tell you that when it comes to determining the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we need to perform a simple division operation. The total amount of money Peter has is $42, and the cost of one trip to the movies is $14 (ticket + popcorn).

To find the number of trips, we'll divide the total amount of money by the cost of one trip:

42 ÷ 14 = 3

This result indicates that Peter can go to the movies 3 times with the money he has."
"When it comes to determining the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck while adhering to a bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the weight capacity of the bridge, the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck, and the weight of each box.

Given:
- Weight limit of the bridge: 5000 pounds
- Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds
- Weight of each box: 15 pounds

To find the maximum weight allowed on the truck, we subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

Maximum weight allowed on the truck: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Now, we divide the maximum weight allowed on the truck by the weight of each box to determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Maximum number of boxes: 1245 ÷ 15 = 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to consider the additional fees and tip. 

First, let's calculate the 25% fee on the final bill of $40.00. This can be done by multiplying the bill by 0.25 (which is equivalent to 25% expressed as a decimal).

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Next, we add the 25% fee to the final bill:

$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Then, we add the delivery fee of $3.00:

$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:

$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving multiplication and addition. To find the total number of raspberries, we first calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster.

6 clusters * 20 raspberries per cluster = 6 × 20 = 120 raspberries

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries to the total number of raspberries in the clusters.

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 120 + 67 = 187 raspberries

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 187.

The final answer is: 187"
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to determine the total number of oranges that are not good. 

First, we find the number of unripe oranges, which is 20% of 25. 
20% of 25 = (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Next, we add the number of bad oranges to the number of unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

The final answer is: 19"
"When calculating the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to consider the costs of the material, the jeweler, and the insurance. 

First, we add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance. To find 10% of a number, we multiply it by 0.1. So, 10% of $1300 is 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid for the brooch is $1430.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 10 years and then apply the 5% annual increase for the remaining 20 years.

The annual pension for the first 10 years is $50,000/year. To find the value of the pension after 10 years, we can use the formula for the future value of a series:

FV = PMT x [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r

where FV is the future value, PMT is the annual payment, r is the interest rate (or in this case, the annual increase rate), and n is the number of years.

However, since the annual increase is 5% of the value of the pension, we can simplify the calculation by using the formula for compound interest:

FV = PV x (1 + r)^n

where PV is the present value (the initial value of the pension), r is the annual increase rate (5% or 0.05), and n is the number of years (10).

Since the annual pension is $50,000, we can consider this as the present value (PV) for the first 10 years. 

FV = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^10
FV ≈ $50,000 x 1.6289
FV ≈ $81,445

This is the value of the pension after 10 years. For the remaining 20 years, Marcy gets 5% of this value as an annual increase.

Annual increase = 0.05 x $81,445 ≈ $4,072.25

To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we add the annual pension for the first 10 years to the annual increase for the remaining 20 years:

Annual pension after 30 years = $50,000 + $4,072.25
Annual pension after 30 years ≈ $54,072.25

The final answer is: $54,072.25"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to determine the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The initial monthly charge is $140. For the first half of the year, which consists of 6 months, Aleena paid a total of $140 * 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the reduced monthly charge, we calculate 90% of the initial amount, which is 0.9 * $140 = $126. For the second half of the year, Aleena paid a total of $126 * 6 = $756.

To find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we add the amounts paid for the first and second halves of the year: $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

Given the car's fuel efficiency, we can conclude that Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: 300"
"To calculate the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, let's determine the daily time spent on these activities. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours per day.

Since this pattern repeats 7 days a week, we can multiply the daily time by 7 to find the weekly total: 3 hours/day * 7 days/week = 21 hours/week.

To find the total time spent over 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4: 21 hours/week * 4 weeks = 84 hours.

"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of people sent by four schools to a basketball tournament. Each school has two teams, a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team, with 5 players on each team. Additionally, each school has a coach for each team.

To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of teams per school by the number of players per team: 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players per school.

Next, we need to account for the coaches. Since each school has 2 coaches, one for each team, we add this to the total number of students: 10 students + 2 coaches = 12 people per school.

Now, to find the total number of people sent by all four schools, we multiply the number of people per school by the total number of schools: 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people.

The final answer is: 48"
"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving addition and subtraction. To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of rubies and emeralds first.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so we subtract 35 from the number of diamonds: 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we multiply the number of rubies by 2: 140 × 2 = 280.

Now, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently say that the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"When dealing with ratios and division problems, it's essential to break down the information provided and apply the appropriate mathematical operations. In this scenario, we're given that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school, with 60 girls present.

To find the number of boys, we can use the given ratio: boys = 2 * girls. Substituting the given value, we get boys = 2 * 60 = 120.

Now, we need to determine the total number of students, which is the sum of boys and girls: total students = boys + girls = 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5: number of teachers = total students / 5 = 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, the correct answer is 36."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple linear equation. Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as 'x'. We know that she receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

We are given that at the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To find the initial amount of money Bailey had, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To determine Judy's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the price per student.

First, let's find the total number of classes in a week. Judy teaches 5 classes per day for 5 weekdays, which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes. She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Now, we multiply the total number of classes by the number of students per class: 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Next, we multiply the total number of students by the price per student: 495 * $15 = $7425.

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in a week.

The final answer is: $7425"
"When it comes to calculating the total number of instructions for preparing two dishes, we need to consider the number of instructions in each recipe. 

The first recipe has 20 instructions. Multiplication is a fundamental operation in mathematics, and in this case, it's essential to understand that the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. This can be represented as 2 * 20.

To find the product of 2 and 20, we multiply the numbers together: 2 * 20 = 40. This means the second recipe has 40 instructions.

Now, to find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in both recipes. This is a basic addition problem: 20 + 40.

Performing the addition, we get: 20 + 40 = 60.

Therefore, the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"The art of calculating total earnings from sales. A fundamental concept in arithmetic, yet often overlooked in its simplicity. To determine the total amount of money Tommy raises, we must first calculate the revenue generated from the brownies and the cheesecakes separately.

The revenue from the brownies can be calculated by multiplying the number of brownies sold (43) by the price per brownie ($3). This yields 43 × $3 = $129.

Similarly, the revenue from the cheesecakes can be calculated by multiplying the number of cheesecakes sold (23) by the price per cheesecake ($4). This results in 23 × $4 = $92.

Now, to find the total amount of money Tommy raises, we add the revenue from the brownies and the cheesecakes together: $129 + $92 = $221.

The final answer is: $221"
"To calculate the monthly payment for Shiela's cell phone installment, we need to consider the total cost of the cell phones, the interest charged, and the number of installments.

The original price of 5 cell phones is $150 each, so the total cost is 5 * $150 = $750.

The interest charged for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest charged for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones, including interest, is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total cost by the number of installments, which is 3.

The monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

The final answer is: $255"
"As a seasoned expert in rounding and multiplication, I'll tackle this problem with precision. When rounding prices to the nearest dollar, we need to consider the decimal portion of each price. 

For marigolds, the price is $2.74, which rounds up to $3 since the decimal portion is greater than 0.5. For petunias, the price is $1.87, which rounds down to $2 since the decimal portion is less than 0.5. Lastly, for begonias, the price is $2.12, which also rounds up to $2.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

To find the total amount, we simply add these amounts together:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of a geometric series, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant, in this case, 1/2. The formula to find the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 16 (the top level), r = 1/2 (since each level has half the square footage of the previous one), and n = 4 (the number of levels).

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
= 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) * 2
= 15

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the sum by the number of levels:

Average = S / n
= 15 / 4
= 3.75

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.75}$"
"As a seasoned expert in multi-step arithmetic problems, I'll break down the solution into manageable parts.

To determine the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in that period.

First, let's find out how much dog food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for 180 days, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. Since the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, we add the amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days to the amount eaten in the rest of the year:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year by dividing the total amount of dog food eaten by the number of cups in a bag:

550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"When analyzing the given problem, we can establish a ratio of laundry done by each individual. Let's denote the amount of laundry done by David as D, Sarah as S, and Raymond as R.

Given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can express this as S = 4D. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the amount of laundry done by David:

S = 4D
400 = 4D
D = 400 / 4
D = 100

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find the amount of laundry done by Raymond, who does half as much laundry as Sarah:

R = S / 2
R = 400 / 2
R = 200

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount done by David from the amount done by Raymond:

Difference = R - D
= 200 - 100
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the better price for buying 18 flowers, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $\frac{\$2.50}{3} = \$0.8333$ per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $\frac{\$1}{2} = \$0.5$ per flower.

Since $\$0.5$ per flower is less than $\$0.8333$ per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
The number of packages of 2 flowers needed is $\frac{18}{2} = 9$.
The total cost is $9 \times \$1 = \$9$.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
The number of packages of 3 flowers needed is $\frac{18}{3} = 6$.
The total cost is $6 \times \$2.50 = \$15$.

The difference in cost is $\$15 - \$9 = \$6$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"When it comes to calculating discounts, I always start by identifying the original price and the discount percentage. In this case, the original price of the grooming service is $100, and the discount percentage is 30%.

To find the discount amount, I'll multiply the original price by the discount percentage expressed as a decimal. The discount percentage as a decimal is 0.3 (since 30% = 30/100 = 0.3). 

Discount amount = Original price * Discount percentage
= $100 * 0.3
= $30

Now, to find the cost after the discount, I'll subtract the discount amount from the original price.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the cost of the grooming service after the discount is $70."
"To find the amount of water left, we first need to determine the total amount of water taken by the girls. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

(1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we need to add the amount of water taken by the boy, which is 6 liters. 

Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, we can subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water to find the amount left:

Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations. 

First, we add the initial number of stickers Charlie had to the number of stickers he bought: 10 + 21 = 31.

Next, we add the number of stickers he received for his birthday: 31 + 23 = 54.

Then, we subtract the number of stickers he gave to his sister: 54 - 9 = 45.

Finally, we subtract the number of stickers he used to decorate a greeting card: 45 - 28 = 17.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. This is a straightforward application of multiplication and subtraction.

First, we multiply Grace's weight by 4: 4 × 125 = 500 pounds.

Next, we subtract 2 pounds from this result to find Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of a multi-step multiplication problem. As an expert in multiplication, I can assure you that the correct approach is to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush. This is a straightforward multiplication problem: 3 × 25 = 75.

Next, we take the result from the previous step and multiply it by the number of thorns per rose. This is another multiplication problem: 75 × 8 = 600.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation W + L = 22.

We also know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write the equation W = L + 8.

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

W + L = 22
W = L + 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for L:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into one of the original equations:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of years he has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so we subtract the starting age from the current age to find the number of years he has been vacationing: 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Now, we multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year: 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of times an alarm rang. To approach this, we need to break it down into manageable parts.

Let's denote the number of times the alarm rang the first time as $a = 4$. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so the number of times it rang is $3a = 3 \times 4 = 12$. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so the number of times it rang is $\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6$.

Now, to find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to add up the number of times it rang each time: $a + 3a + \frac{1}{2} \times 3a = 4 + 12 + 6$.

Using the distributive property of addition, we can rewrite the expression as $(4 + 12 + 6)$. Now, we can add the numbers together: $4 + 12 + 6 = 22$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"As a seasoned expert in calculating compound interest, I'll break down the problem into manageable components to determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service.

The initial annual salary is $600, and the company increases it by 10% every year for employees who have completed five years of service. This is a classic example of a compound interest problem, where the interest rate is 10% and the principal amount is the initial salary.

To calculate the salary after three more years, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = final amount
P = principal amount (initial salary) = $600
r = annual interest rate (10% in this case) = 0.10
n = number of years = 3 (since we're calculating the salary after 3 more years)

However, we need to consider the fact that the interest rate is applied to the new principal amount each year. Since Sylvie's salary increases by 10% every year for the first 5 years, we need to calculate the salary after 5 years first.

The salary after 5 years can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n
A = $600(1 + 0.10)^5
A = $600(1.10)^5
A = $600 * 1.61051
A = $966.306

Now that we have the salary after 5 years, we can calculate the salary after 3 more years. We'll use the same formula, but with the new principal amount ($966.306) and the same interest rate (10%).

A = P(1 + r)^n
A = $966.306(1 + 0.10)^3
A = $966.306(1.10)^3
A = $966.306 * 1.331
A = $1285.11146

Rounding to two decimal places, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $1285.11.

The final answer is: $1285.11"
"To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11

H = 8000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To determine the total cost of gift bags for Christina's party, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

Let's represent the total number of guests as 16. To find 1/4 of 16, we multiply 16 by 1/4, which is equivalent to 16 * 0.25.

16 * 0.25 = 4

Now, we subtract this value from the total number of guests to find the number of guests who will attend.

16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 * 2 = 18

The final answer is: $18"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can confidently calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the dinosaur picnic.

To determine the total amount of potato salad required, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount eaten by adults. Since each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad and there are 20 adults, we can multiply 10 pounds by 20 to get the total amount eaten by adults:

10 pounds/adult × 20 adults = 10 × 20 = 200 pounds

Next, let's calculate the amount eaten by children. Since each child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds, and there are 5 children, we can multiply 5 pounds by 5 to get the total amount eaten by children:

5 pounds/child × 5 children = 5 × 5 = 25 pounds

Now, we can add the amounts eaten by adults and children to get the total amount of potato salad needed:

200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds

Therefore, Ted the T-Rex needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.

The final answer is: 225"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as C, the number of pets Marcia has as M, and the number of pets Jan has as J.

We are given the following information:

1. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia: J = 3M
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy: M = C + 2
3. Cindy has four pets: C = 4

We can substitute the value of C into the second equation to find the value of M:
M = C + 2
M = 4 + 2
M = 6

Now that we have the value of M, we can substitute it into the first equation to find the value of J:
J = 3M
J = 3(6)
J = 18

Now that we have the values of J, M, and C, we can find the total number of pets by adding them together:
Total = J + M + C
Total = 18 + 6 + 4
Total = 28

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James as A, J, C, and J respectively.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. C = J + 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)
4. J = 10 (James is 10 years old)

We can substitute equation (4) into equation (3) to find Corey's age:
C = 10 + 1
C = 11

Now, we can substitute Corey's age into equation (2) to find Amy's age:
A = 11 - 2
A = 9

Finally, we can substitute Amy's age into equation (1) to find Jackson's age:
9 = J + 5
J = 9 - 5
J = 4

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote Gerald's original time as G. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so we can express Lee's time as G - 2.

We are also given that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find the new time, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

New time = Original time + (Original time * Percentage increase)

In this case, the percentage increase is 10% or 0.10. We can set up the equation as follows:

New time = G + (G * 0.10)

We are also given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up the equation:

G - 2 = 38

To solve for G, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation:

G = 40

Now that we know Gerald's original time, we can find his new time by substituting G into the equation:

New time = 40 + (40 * 0.10)
New time = 40 + 4
New time = 44

However, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to subtract the 10% increase from his original time to find his new time. We can set up the equation as follows:

New time = G - (G * 0.10)
New time = 40 - (40 * 0.10)
New time = 40 - 4
New time = 36

Therefore, Gerald's new time is 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Given the problem, we can model it as a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

From the information provided, we have the following equations:

1. R = D + C - 12 (The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats)
2. C = 2D (There are two cats for every dog)
3. D = 60 (The number of dogs is 60)

We can substitute the value of D from equation 3 into equation 2 to find the number of cats:
C = 2(60)
C = 120

Now, we can substitute the values of D and C into equation 1 to find the number of rabbits:
R = 60 + 120 - 12
R = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total = D + C + R
Total = 60 + 120 + 168
Total = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we need to determine the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls. 

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

Girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we first need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Let's denote the hours Harry slept as H. We know that H = 9 hours. To find 2/3 of H, we multiply H by 2/3. 

(2/3) * H = (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. Let's denote the hours James slept as J. We know that J = (2/3) * H = 6 hours. 

To find the difference, we subtract J from H: H - J = 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Therefore, the difference in hours slept between Harry and James is 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a ratio between the volume of the sauce and the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the ratio of the sauce volume to the original tomato volume is 1:2.

Let's denote the original volume of the tomatoes as x. The ratio of the sauce volume to the original tomato volume is 1:2, so we can set up the following proportion:

32 / (x/2) = 1/2

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

32 * 2 = x
64 = x

Now that we know the original volume of the tomatoes, we can find the number of cans used by dividing the original volume by the volume of each can:

x / 16 = 64 / 16
4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:

4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes

The final answer is: 12"
"When analyzing word problems involving subtraction and working backwards, it's essential to identify the key information and set up the correct equation. In this scenario, we're given that 5 cars took an exit, leaving 25 cars to drive through the traffic jam. We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars in the first 15 minutes and the cars in the remaining 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"As an expert in addition, subtraction, and multiplication, I can confidently solve this problem.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we need to add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery: 80 + 18 = 98.

Now, let's determine how many potted plants she will give away. Since she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 1 * 40 = 40.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. 

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this value, we can multiply the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell by 1/4 and then add it to the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell. This can be expressed as:

20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we can find the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell by adding 10 to this value:

60 + 10 = 70

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend:

20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is 175.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we must first calculate the total number of pages he has to read. This can be achieved by adding the number of pages from each textbook.

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract this from the total to find the remaining pages.

39 - 15 = 24

Now, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days Solo has to complete his reading to find the average number of pages he needs to read per day.

24 ÷ 4 = 6

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day on average to complete his reading.

The final answer is: 6"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can break down the problem into manageable parts. To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, we can calculate the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekdays as follows:

5 (weekdays) × 4 (glasses of water per day) = 5 × 4 = 20

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, we can calculate the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekends as follows:

2 (weekend days) × 3 (glasses of water per day) = 2 × 3 = 6

Now, we can add the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends to find the total number of glasses of water he drinks in a week:

20 (glasses of water on weekdays) + 6 (glasses of water on weekends) = 20 + 6 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"Given the scenario, we have a ratio of distance covered to time taken, which is 3 miles to 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cover the entire city, we need to establish a proportion.

Let's denote the unknown time as 't'. The proportion can be set up as follows:

3 miles / 10 minutes = 42 miles / t

To solve for 't', we can cross-multiply:

3t = 42 * 10

Now, we can solve for 't':

3t = 420

Divide both sides by 3:

t = 420 / 3

t = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, let's calculate the number of pieces Poppy placed, which is a quarter of the total 1000 pieces.

1000 pieces / 4 = 250 pieces

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250 pieces. This can be calculated by subtracting 250 from 1000.

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

Next, we need to determine the number of pieces her mom placed, which is a third of the remaining 750 pieces.

750 pieces / 3 = 250 pieces

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250 pieces. This can be calculated by subtracting 250 from 750.

750 - 250 = 500 pieces

Therefore, there are 500 pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: 500"
"Given that Amir eats 5 cookies, we can determine the number of cookies Cody eats by applying the multiplication principle. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we can express this relationship as:

Cody's cookies = 3 × Amir's cookies
Cody's cookies = 3 × 5
Cody's cookies = 15

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we can apply the addition principle, which states that the sum of two or more numbers is the total number of units in all the sets.

Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

Therefore, the total number of cookies they eat together is 20."
"To calculate the total inner volume of the boxes, we need to find the inner dimensions of each box and then multiply them together.

The outer dimensions of each box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, with 1-inch thick walls. To find the inner dimensions, we subtract 2 inches from each side, since the walls are 1 inch thick on each side.

The inner length (L) is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.
The inner width (W) is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.
The inner height (H) is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume (V) of one box using the formula V = L * W * H:
V = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume:
Total inner volume = 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday as x.

We know that the total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2(1) + 0.5x + 1(1) + 0.5(1) + 2(1) = 7

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2 + 0.5x + 1 + 0.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:

5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 3

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, he bakes 2x cookies. However, he accidentally bakes 15 more cookies than intended, so the actual number of cookies he bakes is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"The calculation for determining the total cost of gas after cashback rewards is a straightforward application of multiplication and subtraction. 

First, we calculate the total cost of gas without rewards by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons purchased: 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00.

Next, we calculate the total cashback rewards by multiplying the cashback reward per gallon by the number of gallons purchased: 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00.

Now, we subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards to find the final cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total area of the fruit roll-ups and then finding the average. To do this, we need to consider the dimensions of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, while Marcell's are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. Since the width and length are given in terms of roll-ups, we can treat this as a problem involving area.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = length × width. In this case, we can calculate the area of each roll-up as follows:

Beatrice's roll-ups: A = 2 roll-ups × 24 roll-ups = 48 square roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: A = 3 roll-ups × 14 roll-ups = 42 square roll-ups

However, since we are dealing with a 2D shape, we need to consider the total area of each roll-up, not just the number of roll-ups. To find the total area, we need to multiply the area of each roll-up by the number of roll-ups.

Beatrice's total area = 48 square roll-ups × 24 roll-ups = 1152 square roll-ups
Marcell's total area = 42 square roll-ups × 14 roll-ups = 588 square roll-ups

Now, we can find the total number of roll-ups eaten by adding the total areas of each roll-up and then taking the square root of the result, since we are dealing with a 2D shape. However, since we are looking for the average number of roll-ups eaten, we can simply add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 1152 + 588 = 1740
Average roll-ups eaten = 1740 / 2 = 870 / 2 = 435

The final answer is: 435"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a proportion to find out how much water the boat takes on per second. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat takes on water per second. Since the boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can set up a proportion to find the rate of water intake per second.

Let's denote the rate of water intake per second as r. We can set up the proportion as follows:

2 liters / 10 feet = r liters / 1 second

We can cross-multiply to solve for r:

2 * 1 = 10r
2 = 10r
r = 2/10 = 0.2 liters/second

Now that we have the rate of water intake per second, we can find the total amount of water taken on in 64 seconds. We can multiply the rate by the time:

Total water taken on = rate * time
= 0.2 liters/second * 64 seconds
= 12.8 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.8}$"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day. To approach this, we need to consider the number of lessons and the frequency of cleaning per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each with 2 lessons per day. This gives us a total of 4 * 2 = 8 lessons per day.

Now, we need to determine the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson. It's given that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson: 8 * 3 = 24.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The final answer is: 24"
"The problem at hand is a straightforward application of multiplication and subtraction. To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and then subtract the ones that did not grow.

First, we calculate the total number of flowers planted by multiplying the number of flowers planted per day (2) by the number of days (15). This can be expressed as:

2 × 15 = 30

However, we know that 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted:

30 - 5 = 25

Therefore, the total number of flowers Ryan has is 25."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo as D.

From the first statement, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This can be expressed as:

B + 6 = 1800 / 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B + 6 = 300

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

B = 294

From the second statement, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be expressed as:

B = 50D

Substituting the value of B from the previous equation, we get:

294 = 50D

Dividing both sides by 50, we get:

D = 5.88

Since the number of birds must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a bird.

D = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"As a seasoned expert in calculating percentage increases and applying them to costs, I can confidently determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the total cost for these boards is 10 \* $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the total cost for these boards is 5 \* $16 = $80. The total cost of the lumber is therefore $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have increased by 50%, we need to calculate the new price of the lumber. To do this, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (which is equivalent to 100% + 50%). The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 \* 1.5 = $15, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 \* 1.5 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 10 \* $15 = $150. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 5 \* $24 = $120. The total revenue is therefore $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"When dealing with ratios, it's essential to understand the concept of proportionality. In this case, we have a ratio of 7:13 for sugar to water. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar.

The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. The fraction of the mixture that is sugar is 7/20. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120).

Let's calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar: 

$$\frac{7}{20} \times 120 = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42$$

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42."
"The problem at hand is a straightforward multiplication problem. We have 2 pairs of shoes for each of 3 children, and each pair costs $60. To find the total cost, we can use the multiplication principle of repeated addition, but a more efficient approach is to multiply the number of pairs per child by the number of children and then multiply the result by the cost per pair.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Total cost = (2 pairs/child * 3 children) * $60/pair

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the equation to:

Total cost = 2 * 3 * $60

Now, we can perform the multiplication step by step:

2 * 3 = 6
6 * $60 = $360

Therefore, the total amount John paid is $360."
"As a subtraction and division expert, I can confidently tackle this problem. 

To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. 

Let's denote the number of containers on the first day as C1 and the number of vehicles per container as V. We know that C1 = 2 and V = 5. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is C1 * V = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as C2. The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30, so we can set up the equation: 10 + C2 * V = 30.

Since V = 5, we can substitute this value into the equation: 10 + C2 * 5 = 30.

To solve for C2, we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: C2 * 5 = 20.

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 5 to find C2: C2 = 20 / 5.

C2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later, given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, and both of their salaries increased by 40% four years later.

Let's start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's salary as 0.7x, where x is Adrien's salary four years ago. Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, we can set up the equation:

0.7x = 0.7($40000)
x = $40000 / 0.7
x = $57143.57

Now that we know Lylah's salary four years ago, we can calculate her salary four years later. Her salary increased by 40%, so we can express her new salary as 1.4 times her old salary:

Lylah's new salary = 1.4($57143.57)
Lylah's new salary = $80000

Next, we can calculate Adrien's new salary. His salary four years ago was $40000, and it increased by 40%:

Adrien's new salary = 1.4($40000)
Adrien's new salary = $56000

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries:

Total salary = Lylah's new salary + Adrien's new salary
Total salary = $80000 + $56000
Total salary = $136000

The final answer is: $136000"
"To determine the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we need to calculate the total sheets used in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

First, we know Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets. Multiplying these values gives us the total sheets used in a week: 2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can find the total sheets used in a month by multiplying the weekly total by 4: 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month.

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"As an expert in addition and multiplication, I can efficiently calculate the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought.

Let's break it down:

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. To find the total number of fruits she brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 5 + 8 = 13.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

To find the total number of fruits Kael brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, to find the total number of fruits they have in total, we add the number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To calculate the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep pattern.

Let's start with the hours she slept on Monday: 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so we subtract 2 from 8: 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so we add 1 to 6: 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

To find the total hours, we add these values together: 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour and the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Next, we need to find the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means she stamps 1/3 of 60 letters. To find 1/3 of 60, we can multiply 60 by 1/3, which is equivalent to dividing 60 by 3.

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. This leaves 60 - 20 = 40 letters that still need stamps.

We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before she started is 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From the problem statement, we know that Julia initially had 'x' spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, making the total number of spoons 'x + 5'. However, Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew, so the total number of spoons she had after using 3 spoons is 'x + 5 - 3' or 'x + 2'. We are also given that after using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up the equation: x + 2 = 12

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"The task at hand is a simple addition problem involving two quantities: the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

To solve this, we need to add the number of chicken sausages to the number of fish sausages. The number of chicken sausages is given as 38. The number of fish sausages is 6 more than the number of chicken sausages, so it can be expressed as 38 + 6.

To find the total number of fish sausages, we perform the addition: 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

"The problem at hand is a simple arithmetic operation involving addition. To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them has.

Given that Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can express Amy's friends as 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, to find the total number of friends, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

In mathematical notation, this can be represented as:

50 + 70 = 120

Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is 120."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the cost of a pepper as p, the cost of a watermelon as w, and the cost of an orange as o.

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:

1. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs: w = 3p
2. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon: o = w - 5
3. The cost of a pepper is given as $15: p = 15

We can substitute the value of p into the first equation to find the cost of a watermelon: w = 3(15) = 45

Now, we can substitute the value of w into the second equation to find the cost of an orange: o = 45 - 5 = 40

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together. The cost of 4 watermelons is 4w = 4(45) = 180, the cost of 20 peppers is 20p = 20(15) = 300, and the cost of 10 oranges is 10o = 10(40) = 400.

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges: 180 + 300 + 400 = 880.

"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue generated.

First, let's convert the average time per patient from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

24 minutes/patient = 24/60 hours/patient = 0.4 hours/patient

Now, we can calculate the total time spent by doctors:

500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital. Since the hospital charges patients $200 per hour, and each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, the revenue per patient is:

$200/hour * 0.4 hours/patient = $80/patient

Now, we can calculate the total revenue:

500 patients * $80/patient = $40000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40000 - $30000
Profit = $10000

The final answer is: $10000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them. A third of the 60 elves is equivalent to 60 × (1/3) = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Now, we subtract the number of elves that quit from the initial total: 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find the number of elves left, we subtract 10 from the previous total: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

The final answer is: 30"

"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival. To approach this, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Let's start by calculating the total number of rides for each person. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so her total number of rides is 2 + 2 = 4. Similarly, Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so his total number of rides is 4 + 2 = 6.

Now, we need to find the total number of rides. This can be done by adding the number of rides taken by Pam and Fred: 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of tickets used. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, we can multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride: 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.
- He walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday.
- The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles.

First, we need to find out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

Now, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for the three days: 41 - (4 + 24).

To solve the expression inside the parentheses first, we add 4 and 24: 4 + 24 = 28.

Now, we subtract 28 from 41: 41 - 28 = 13.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"As a multiplication expert, I can tell you that the problem at hand is a straightforward application of the multiplication operation. We're given that Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. To find the total cost per month, we simply multiply the number of car washes by the cost per car wash:

4 car washes/month × $15/car wash = $60/month

Now, to find the total cost per year, we need to multiply the total cost per month by 12, the number of months in a year:

$60/month × 12 months/year = $720/year

This is a classic example of the distributive property of multiplication, where we can break down the multiplication into smaller, more manageable parts. In this case, we can think of it as multiplying 4 by 12 and then multiplying 15 by 12, and then adding the results together. However, the most efficient way to solve this problem is to simply multiply the two numbers together.

The final answer is: $720"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of video games Brian has as B and the number of video games Bobby has as b.

We are given that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. This can be expressed as:

b = 3B - 5

We also know that Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so we can express this as:

B = 20 - 5
B = 15

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the equation for b:

b = 3(15) - 5
b = 45 - 5
b = 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the total 27 unicorns reside there, we can express this as a fraction: 1/3 * 27. To calculate this, we multiply the numerator (1) by the total number of unicorns (27) and then divide by the denominator (3). This can be represented as:

(1/3) * 27 = (1 * 27) / 3 = 27/3 = 9

Now that we know there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands, we can find the number of female unicorns. Two thirds of these unicorns are female, which can be expressed as a fraction: 2/3 * 9. To calculate this, we multiply the numerator (2) by the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands (9) and then divide by the denominator (3). This can be represented as:

(2/3) * 9 = (2 * 9) / 3 = 18/3 = 6

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to break down the calculation into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 × $7.50 = $15.00.
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 × $1.50 = $3.00.
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 × $1.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's add the costs of the items together: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20: 0.20 × $20.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"Given the scenario, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of questions Mark completed in each test. We know he completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and had 8 hours to complete it. However, since he only had 8 hours, we can calculate the number of questions he completed in that time frame.

Number of questions completed in the first test = Rate × Time = 5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions

Now, let's move on to the second test. Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. We can calculate the number of questions he completed in this time frame as well.

Number of questions completed in the second test = Rate × Time = 5 questions/hour × 6 hours = 30 questions

To find the total number of questions Mark completed in both tests, we add the number of questions completed in each test.

Total questions completed = 40 questions (first test) + 30 questions (second test) = 70 questions

Now, we need to find the total number of questions in both tests.

Total questions in both tests = 75 questions (first test) + 100 questions (second test) = 175 questions

Finally, we can find the number of questions Mark left incomplete by subtracting the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions in both tests.

Questions left incomplete = Total questions in both tests - Total questions completed = 175 questions - 70 questions = 105 questions

The final answer is: 105"
"Given the problem, we can express the relationship between the number of pink and blue gumballs as an equation. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P.

We are given that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be expressed as:

P = 4B + 22

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs. Substituting B = 12 into the equation, we get:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first identify the number of semi-automatic cars. Given that there are 20 available cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars using the formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%.

The final answer is: 20"
"Given the problem, we have a system of equations representing the relationships between the number of worker bees (W), baby bees (B), and queens (Q) in the hive. We can express these relationships as:

1. W = 2B (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
2. B = 2Q (twice as many babies as queens)
3. W + B + Q = 700 (total number of bees in the hive)

To solve for the number of worker bees, we can use substitution and elimination methods to find the value of W.

First, we can substitute B = 2Q into the first equation to get W = 2(2Q), which simplifies to W = 4Q.

Next, we can substitute W = 4Q and B = 2Q into the third equation to get 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700, which simplifies to 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we have the value of Q, we can find the value of B by substituting Q = 100 into the equation B = 2Q, which gives us B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the value of W by substituting Q = 100 into the equation W = 4Q, which gives us W = 4(100) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total earnings of an individual who would otherwise spend their time playing video games. Given that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day and earns $10 per hour, we can calculate his weekly earnings by first determining the total hours he would work in a week.

To find the total hours worked in a week, we multiply the daily hours worked by the number of days in a week: 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total hours worked by the hourly wage: 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

Therefore, the correct answer is $140."
"When calculating the total cost of items with sales tax, it's essential to identify the taxable and non-taxable items. In this scenario, we have the following items:

- Milk: 2 dollars (non-taxable)
- Eggs: 3 dollars (non-taxable)
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars (taxable)
- Cups: 3 dollars (taxable)
- Roach traps: 4 dollars (taxable)

To calculate the total cost, we'll first find the cost of taxable items and apply the 10% sales tax to that amount. The cost of taxable items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. The sales tax is 10% of 10 dollars, which is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the sales tax to the cost of taxable items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Next, we add the cost of non-taxable items (milk and eggs) to the total cost of taxable items with tax: 11 + 5 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 8 clients in total, with each client requiring 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare:
100 pineapples/hectare

Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Next, we need to determine the number of harvests in a year. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: 4000"
"The task at hand involves calculating the total number of LEGO pieces Johnny needs to pick up. To accomplish this, we must first determine the number of pieces in each set.

The first set contains 500 pieces. 

The second set has three times the number of pieces as the first set, which can be expressed as 3 × 500. Multiplying 3 by 500 yields 1500 pieces in the second set.

The third set has one-fourth the number of pieces as the first set, which can be expressed as 500 ÷ 4 or 500 × (1/4). Dividing 500 by 4 or multiplying 500 by 1/4 yields 125 pieces in the third set.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125.

To perform this addition, we can group the numbers in a way that facilitates easy calculation. We can start by adding the first two numbers: 500 + 1500 = 2000. Then, we add the third number to this result: 2000 + 125 = 2125.

Therefore, the total number of LEGO pieces Johnny needs to pick up is 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of bees that leave the hive in the first 6 hours as L. We are given that L = 30.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, the number of bees that return in the next 6 hours is (1/2)L = (1/2)(30) = 15.

The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is L + 15 = 30 + 15 = 45. However, 15 of these bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 45 - 15 = 30.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial L bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, the number of bees that leave in the next 6 hours is 2L = 2(30) = 60.

The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is L + 60 = 30 + 60 = 90. However, 30 of these bees had not returned yet, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"

"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of friends Charlie, Dorothy, and James have on Facebook. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as ""D"". 

We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express this as an equation: C = 3D, where C represents the number of friends Charlie has.

We are also given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

C = 3D
12 = 3D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this as an equation: J = 4D, where J represents the number of friends James has.

Substituting the value of D into the equation, we get:

J = 4D
J = 4(4)
J = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Given the scenario, we have two individuals, Steve and Tim, competing to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school, which translates to 5280 feet, and he can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. On the other hand, Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, equivalent to 10560 feet, and he can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

To determine the time it takes for each individual to get home, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

For Steve: Time = 5280 / 440 = 12 minutes

For Tim: Time = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner of the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 12
Difference in time = 28 minutes

Therefore, the winner, Steve, will be waiting 28 minutes at their house before the loser, Tim, finishes the race.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to determine the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

"The problem at hand involves calculating the total cost of the cookies and then determining the change Carl receives after paying with a $10 bill. To begin, we need to calculate the total number of cookies and their total cost.

The number of packs of cookies is 10, and each pack contains 6 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

10 packs × 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Now, we need to find the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is:

60 cookies × $0.10/cookie = $6

To find the change Carl receives, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill:

$10 - $6 = $4

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we'll work backwards to find the initial number of french fries in the pack. Let's denote the initial number of fries as x.

We know that after the ants carried off a french fry, 5 fries remained. So, before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

Before the raccoon, there were 6 fries. Since the raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, 1/3 of the fries remained. We can set up the equation:

(1/3)(x - 30) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x - 30 = 18

Now, add 30 to both sides:

x = 48

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"As a seasoned expert in calculating weekly totals and multiplying by a given number of weeks, I can efficiently determine the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester.

To calculate the total hours per week, we need to consider the hours spent on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the hours spent on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

For Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

For Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 300 * 4 = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 120 * 6 = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 60 * 24 = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of each type of ape and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, their total consumption is 2 * 200 = 2 × 200 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, their total consumption is 2 * 400 = 2 × 400 = 800 bananas.

The baboons require 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, their total consumption is 2 * 100 = 2 × 100 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1400}$"
"When analyzing the distances covered by Blake and Kelly, it's essential to consider the pattern of their movements. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he covers the entire length of the field for each run, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards per run. Therefore, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly's movement pattern is slightly different. She runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She repeats this pattern 34 times. To find the total distance she covers, we need to multiply the distance of her second pattern by the number of repetitions and add the initial 200 yards. The total distance Kelly covers is 34 * 80 + 200 = 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, let's compare the distances covered by Blake and Kelly. Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"

"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"The problem at hand is a classic example of compound interest, where the price of the bag of marbles increases by a fixed percentage every two months. To solve this, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
A = the future value of the investment/price
P = the principal amount (initial price) = $20
r = the annual interest rate (increase percentage) = 20% = 0.20
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year = 6 (since it's compounded every 2 months)
t = the time the money is invested for in years = 36/24 = 1.5 years

However, since the interest is compounded every 2 months, we can use the formula for compound interest with a period of 2 months:

A = P(1 + r)^t

where:
A = the future value of the investment/price
P = the principal amount (initial price) = $20
r = the interest rate per period = 20% = 0.20
t = the number of periods = 36/2 = 18 periods

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = $20(1 + 0.20)^18
A ≈ $20(3.320116922)
A ≈ $66.40333544

Therefore, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately $66.40.

The final answer is: $66.40"

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90. To determine the difference in outcomes, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income lost:

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing.

To find the total cost of the computer accessories, I will add the individual costs together:

€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) = €1247
€1247 + €74 (CD burner) = €1321
€1321 + €102 (printer) = €1423

Now, I will subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To determine the number of times Sandra needs to babysit, we must first calculate the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs and she's making 15, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 3 eggs/flan * 15 flans = 45 eggs.

Now, we need to divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job, which is 9 eggs. This can be expressed as a division problem: 45 eggs ÷ 9 eggs/babysitting job = 5 babysitting jobs.

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to obtain the required number of eggs for the Spanish flans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations. Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write the second equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Given that Ethel has $8, we can express Jimmy's amount of money as a linear equation. Let's denote Jimmy's amount as J and Ethel's amount as E. We are given that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, which can be written as:

J = 2E + 2

Substituting the value of E (Ethel's amount) as $8, we get:

J = 2(8) + 2
J = 16 + 2
J = 18

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend days separately.

The number of miles walked on weekdays is 20 miles/day * 5 days = 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

The number of miles walked on weekend days is 10 miles/day * 2 days = 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekend days: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"As an expert in multiplication and averaging, I can confidently break down the problem of calculating the total cost of each uniform.

To find the cost of the jacket, we multiply the cost of the hat by 3, since it costs three times as much. The cost of the hat is $25, so the cost of the jacket is 3 × $25 = $75.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pants, which is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"The task at hand is a straightforward application of arithmetic operations. To calculate the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of each type of creature by its respective number of legs and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 80 × 8 = 640 legs.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of legs for the insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 90 × 6 = 540 legs.

Lastly, we'll calculate the total number of legs for the mutant invertebrates: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 3 × 10 = 30 legs.

Now, we'll add these results together to find the total number of legs: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: 1210"
"Let's analyze the problem using a system of linear equations. We have the following information:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red: S2 = G + 3
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four: G = 2S4
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo: S4 = S32
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old: S32 = 8

We can substitute the value of S32 into equation (3) to get S4 = 8. Then, we can substitute S4 into equation (2) to get G = 2(8) = 16.

Now, we can substitute the value of G into equation (1) to get S2 = 16 + 3 = 19.

To find the total age of the four birds, we can add their ages together: S2 + G + S4 + S32 = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

The final answer is: 51"
"To determine the total annual payment, we need to calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt and then sum them up. 

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt by multiplying the minimum payment by 1.5 (50% increase):

- Student loans: $300 × 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 × 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 × 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment:
$1500 × 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

The time to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes. To convert the time to cut one potato from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 5 seconds / 60 = 5/60 minutes = 1/12 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (1/12) minutes/potato = 5 minutes.

Finally, we add the total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations involving profit, cost, and unit pricing. Let's denote the number of gallons as G, the cost of lemons per gallon as L, and the cost of sugar per gallon as S.

Given:
- Cost of lemons and sugar per gallon: L + S = $5
- Cost of sugar per gallon: S = $2
- Cost of lemons per gallon: L = $5 - S = $3
- Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon
- Total revenue: $10G
- Total cost: LG + SG
- Profit: $25

We can now set up the equation for profit:
Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10G - (LG + SG) = $25

Substituting the values of L and S:
$10G - (3G + 2G) = $25
$10G - 5G = $25
$5G = $25

Now, we can solve for G:
G = $25 / $5
G = 5 gallons

Now that we have the number of gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons:
Total cost of lemons = LG
Total cost of lemons = 3G
Total cost of lemons = 3 * 5
Total cost of lemons = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"When dealing with word problems involving groups, it's essential to break down the information provided and apply the principles of set theory. In this case, we have a total of 240 participants in the race, with 80 of them being Japanese. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we're given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach to calculate Zaid's remaining amount after all expenses and donations.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: 1/4 of 6000 = 600.

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 = 2000.

Now, we subtract these amounts from Zaid's monthly income to find the remaining amount: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400.

Since Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, we calculate this as: 1/2 of 3400 = 1700.

After the donation, we subtract this amount from the remaining amount: 3400 - 1700 = 1700.

Next, we need to account for the amounts given to his daughter and wife: 200 + 700 = 900.

Finally, we subtract this total from the remaining amount to find Zaid's final remaining amount: 1700 - 900 = 800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as M, the number of crabs Rani has as R, and the number of crabs Bo has as B.

We are given the following information:
1. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic: R = M + 10
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo: M = B - 4
3. Bo has 40 crabs: B = 40

We can substitute the value of B into the second equation to find the value of M:
M = 40 - 4
M = 36

Now that we have the value of M, we can substitute it into the first equation to find the value of R:
R = 36 + 10
R = 46

Now that we have the values of M and R, we can find the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs each person has:
Total = B + M + R
Total = 40 + 36 + 46
Total = 122

"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks with ease.

To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and then add them together. 

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour. Multiplying the number of hours by the hourly rate gives us the earnings for the first week:
5 hours × $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour. Multiplying the number of hours by the hourly rate gives us the earnings for the second week:
8 hours × $10/hour = $80

Now, we add the earnings for the first and second weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner secured. Given that the winner obtained 3/4 of the total votes, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * Total votes

Substituting the given total votes, we get:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser received, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between the number of white carnations, pink calla lilies, and red roses. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the equation for the number of pink calla lilies is 5x = 200.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ 5x = 200 \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, the equation for the number of red roses is y = 4x, and we know that x = 40.
\[ y = 4x \]
\[ y = 4(40) \]
\[ y = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Given the problem, we can represent the situation using a system of linear equations. Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jan's current age as J.

From the information provided, we have two equations:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark: J = M + 2
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age: M - 2 = (1/2)(J - 2) + 5

We are also given that Jan is 30 years old, so we can substitute J = 30 into the first equation to find Mark's age:
M + 2 = 30
M = 28

Now, we can substitute J = 30 into the second equation to verify the result:
M - 2 = (1/2)(30 - 2) + 5
28 - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5
26 = 14 + 5
26 = 19

This equation holds true, so our result for Mark's age is consistent with the given information.

To find Jean's age, we can use the first equation: J = M + 2
J = 28 + 2
J = 30

However, we are asked to find Jean's age, not Jan's age. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

"Given the scenario of a 4x400 meter relay, where one team has four members each running 400 meters in 55 seconds, and the other team's runners have a sequential decrease in time by 3 seconds each, starting with 60 seconds for the first runner, we can calculate the total time for each team.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find their total time. The formula is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 4, a1 = 60, and an = 51 (since each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 4/2 * (60 + 51)
S = 2 * 111
S = 222

However, this is the sum of the arithmetic series, but we need to find the total time. Since the runners are running in sequence, we need to consider the time difference between each runner. The correct approach is to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner runs 57 seconds, the third runner runs 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 222 = -2 seconds. However, since time cannot be negative, this indicates that the less well-rounded team is actually faster. The correct calculation is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"When analyzing the probability of independent events, it's essential to consider the individual probabilities of each event and their combined outcomes. In this case, we have two events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to consider the favorable outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

P(>3) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 3/6
= 1/2
= 0.5 or 50%

Next, we'll calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities:

P(even, even) = P(even) * P(even)
= (1/2) * (1/2)
= 1/4
= 0.25 or 25%

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row:

P(>3) - P(even, even) = 0.5 - 0.25
= 0.25
= 25%

Therefore, rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can express the number of apples Jenna picked as a fraction of her mother's total. Since Jenna picked half as many apples, we can represent this as 1/2 * 20 = 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we can add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r' and the number of hamsters as 'h'.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 3r * 6 = 18r.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Additionally, we are given that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

We are also given that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. This can be represented by the equation: 18r + 50 + 20 = 160.

Simplifying the equation, we get 18r + 70 = 160.

Subtracting 70 from both sides, we get 18r = 90.

Dividing both sides by 18, we get r = 5.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to apply the simple interest formula: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $100, the monthly interest rate (r) is 2% or 0.02, and the time period (t) is 3 months or 3/12 years, we can plug these values into the formula.

First, we need to convert the time period to years: t = 3/12 = 0.25 years.

Now, we can calculate the total amount: A = 100(1 + 0.02*0.25) = 100(1 + 0.005) = 100(1.005) = 100.5.

However, since the interest is compounded monthly, we can also use the formula A = P(1 + r)^t, where r is the monthly interest rate and t is the number of periods.

A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 = 100(1.02)^3 = 100(1.061208) = 106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear equation representing the situation. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The total cost of buying the bags is $20x, and the total cost of transporting the bags is $2x. The total cost is the sum of these two, which is $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

$$30x - 22x = 400$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$8x = 400$$

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

$$x = \frac{400}{8}$$

$$x = 50$$

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total cost and the amount each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses for the tickets, food, and rides.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets: $20.25. 

Next, we need to find the cost of the food, which is $4.50 less than the tickets. So, the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the rides: 2 rides at $33 each is 2 * $33 = $66.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since the friends split the cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 ÷ 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes and then multiply it by the peaches collected per minute.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, 3 hours is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes:
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the daily insect consumption of a flock of ten ducks, we first need to calculate their weekly consumption. Given that each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can multiply this value by the total number of ducks.

Weekly insect consumption = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, to find the daily consumption, we divide the weekly consumption by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Daily insect consumption = 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds/day

This is a straightforward application of division, and the result is a clear indication of the daily insect needs of the flock.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

To find the total net change over 10 years, we multiply the net change per year by the number of years: 8 * 10 = 80.

Now, we add the net change to the initial number of trees to find the total number of trees after 10 years: 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply the total number of trees by the percentage that die: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees to find the number of trees Tom has left: 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the initial number of pink flamingos, which is 18.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which can be represented as 18 × (1/3). To find the number of flamingos taken back, we multiply 18 by the fraction 1/3, which is equivalent to dividing 18 by 3. This gives us 18 ÷ 3 = 6 flamingos taken back.

The number of flamingos remaining on Saturday is 18 - 6 = 12. However, these 6 flamingos were then painted white and put back out. So, the total number of white flamingos is now 6, and the number of pink flamingos is still 12.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. Therefore, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"As a multiplication expert, I can tell you that Violetta can buy a total of 10 crayons with her $20, since 20 divided by 2 is 10. However, she only needs 5 different colors, so she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

To find the total cost of the crayons, we multiply the number of crayons by the cost of one crayon: 10 * 2 = $20.

Now, to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has: $20 - $20 = $0.

The final answer is: $0"
"As an expert in addition and multiplication, I can confidently calculate the cost of 8 pens.

To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. 

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we multiply the cost of a pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
= $1.50 * 8
= $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"The task at hand is a straightforward calculation involving multiplication and subtraction. As an expert in subtraction and multiplication, I'll break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total pounds of carrots distributed to the 40 restaurants. This can be calculated using the formula:

Total pounds distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
= 40 * 2
= 80 pounds

Now, to find the pounds of carrots not used, we subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount:

Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed
= 200 - 80
= 120 pounds

Therefore, the pounds of carrots not used is 120."
"Subtraction is my domain, and I'm delighted to tackle this problem. To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the total population: 23786
2. Identify the number of men: 8417
3. Identify the number of women: 9092
4. Subtract the sum of men and women from the total population: 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

To perform this subtraction, I'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, let's subtract 17509 from 23786:

23786 - 17509 = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of cards collected in the first month, which is three times the initial number: 3 × 20 = 60 cards.

Next, we calculate the number of cards collected in the second month, which is 20 fewer than the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Then, we calculate the combined number of cards collected in the first and second months: 60 + 40 = 100 cards.

Now, we calculate the number of cards collected in the third month, which is twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: 2 × 100 = 200 cards.

Finally, we add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's analyze the problem using linear equations.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B is also x.

We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so we can write the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

This means Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

We are given that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is:

5x = 5(500) = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so the amount Mark makes from Publisher B is:

2(5x) = 2(5(500)) = 10(500) = 5000 cents

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of the amounts from both publishers:

Total = 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"As an expert in addition and multiplication, I can confidently calculate the total amount of water Baldur gets every day.

To find the total amount of water, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail. 

The total number of pails Baldur gets in a day is the sum of the pails he gets in the morning and the pails he gets in the afternoon. This can be expressed as:

5 (pails in the morning) + 6 (pails in the afternoon) = 11 pails

Now, we multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water in each pail:

11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters

Therefore, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"As a compensation expert, I can calculate the total annual salary for John, including the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise.

To determine the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then add the one-time monetary reward of $5000.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = $100
New salary = 2000 + 100 = $2100

Since John works every week of the year, we'll multiply his new salary by the number of weeks he works:
Total salary for the year = New salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= $109,200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward:
Total amount made that year = Total salary for the year + One-time reward
= $109,200 + $5,000
= $114,200

The total amount John made that year is $114,200."
"The art of multiplication. It's a fundamental operation that underlies so many aspects of our world, from the growth of crops to the production of wine. In this case, we're dealing with the latter.

To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we need to apply the principles of multiplication. Specifically, we're looking at the product of two quantities: the total tons of grapes produced per year and the number of barrels of wine that can be made from each ton.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that each acre of Josie's 10-acre farm produces 5 tons of grapes per year. To find the total tons of grapes produced per year, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre:

10 acres × 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we need to determine the number of barrels of wine that can be made from each ton of grapes. We're told that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, to find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:

50 tons × 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

In conclusion, Josie's 10-acre farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and calculate the slices used for each meal separately.

First, let's consider the slices used for sandwiches. Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which consists of 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. Therefore, the total slices used for sandwiches can be calculated as follows:

Total slices for sandwiches = Number of days × Slices per sandwich
= 7 × 2
= 14

Next, let's consider the slices used for omelets. Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days of the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 3 slices per omelet. Therefore, the total slices used for omelets can be calculated as follows:

Total slices for omelets = Number of days × Slices per omelet
= 3 × 3
= 9

Now, let's consider the slices used for the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese for this dish.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together:

Total slices = Total slices for sandwiches + Total slices for omelets + Slices for macaroni and cheese
= 14 + 9 + 8
= 31

"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to her initial number of pens.

First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens she bought. Since she bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, we can use the multiplication operation to find the total number of blue pens: 6 × 9 = 54.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of red pens she bought. Since she bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, we can use the multiplication operation again: 2 × 6 = 12.

Now, we need to find the total number of new pens she bought by adding the number of blue and red pens: 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 66 pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 for the semester. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we will first find the total score needed for the semester.

The total score needed for the semester is the average score multiplied by the number of tests. In this case, the average score is 93 and the number of tests is 6.

Total score needed = Average score × Number of tests
= 93 × 6
= 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
= 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = Total score of first five tests - Lowest score
= 338 - 71
= 267

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = Total score needed - Total score of remaining four tests
= 558 - 267
= 291

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by calculating the total kilometers Michael rode his bike in the first four weeks.

In the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike 5 times a week, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. To find the total kilometers for this period, we multiply the number of kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks:

25 km/ride * 5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, we'll calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks. During this period, Michael rode his bike 2 times a week, covering a distance of 60 kilometers each time. To find the total kilometers for this period, we multiply the number of kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks:

60 km/ride * 2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, we add the total kilometers for both periods to find the overall total:

500 km + 360 km = 860 km

The final answer is: 860"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total weight of Joe's bag of candy. To do this, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the weight of the chocolate bars. We know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars. Multiplying the number of chocolate bars by their individual weight gives us the total weight of the chocolate bars:

25 × 40g = 25 × (40g) = 25 × 40 = 1000g

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so the weight of each candied apple is half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

80 × 20g = 80 × (20g) = 80 × 20 = 1600g

Now, we can find the total weight of the bag of candy by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: 2600"

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 × 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"Given the problem, we can establish the following equation to represent the situation:

Let C be the cost of each cup. The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36,000, and twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

20 × 12C = 36,000 - 1,200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240C = 34,800

To find the cost of each cup, we divide both sides of the equation by 240:

C = 34,800 / 240

C = 145

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy: a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes at $20 each.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. We need to find out how much more money she needs to earn. This can be calculated as the total cost minus the amount she already has: $70 - $10 = $60.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are $5 * 4 = $20.

Now, we need to find out how much more money she needs to earn from mowing the lawn. This can be calculated as the amount she needs to earn minus the amount she earns from babysitting: $60 - $20 = $40.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up an equation to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn: 4x = 40, where x is the number of times she needs to mow the lawn.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 40 / 4 = 10.

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.

We know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs while each white chicken produces 5 eggs. This gives us the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

W = R + 2

Now, we can substitute the expression for W into the first equation to solve for R:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Calculating the perimeter of a rectangle and determining the time spent walking based on speed is a straightforward process. Given the dimensions of the park, which is a rectangle measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can apply the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, to find the time spent walking, we need to divide the total distance by the walking speed. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of customers on the third day, we need to calculate the total number of customers on the first two days and then subtract that from the total by the third day.

Let's start by calculating the total number of customers on the first two days:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Total customers on the first two days = 100 + 150 = 250 customers

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total customers on the first two days from the total by the third day:

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - Total customers on the first two days
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's model the situation using a system of differential equations. Let $S(t)$ and $B(t)$ denote the amount of water in the small and big pools, respectively, at time $t$.

We know that the rate of change of water in each pool is the negative of the leak rate, which is 4 gallons/minute. Therefore, we can write the system of differential equations:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -4$$
$$\frac{dB}{dt} = -4$$

We are given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

$$S(t-4) = \frac{1}{2}B(t-4)$$

We are also given that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

$$S = \frac{1}{4}B$$

To solve this system, we can first solve the differential equations:

$$S(t) = S(0) - 4t$$
$$B(t) = B(0) - 4t$$

We can use the initial condition $S(t-4) = \frac{1}{2}B(t-4)$ to find the initial conditions $S(0)$ and $B(0)$. Substituting $t=4$ into the differential equations, we get:

$$S(0) = S(4) + 4(4) = \frac{1}{2}B(4) + 4(4)$$
$$B(0) = B(4) + 4(4) = 2(S(4) + 4(4))$$

Substituting $S(t) = S(0) - 4t$ and $B(t) = B(0) - 4t$ into the equation $S = \frac{1}{4}B$, we get:

$$S(0) - 4t = \frac{1}{4}(B(0) - 4t)$$

Substituting the expressions for $S(0)$ and $B(0)$ in terms of $S(4)$ and $B(4)$, we get:

$$S(4) + 16 = \frac{1}{4}(2S(4) + 32 - 4t)$$

Simplifying the equation:

$$S(4) + 16 = \frac{1}{2}S(4) + 8 - t$$

Subtracting $\frac{1}{2}S(4)$ from both sides:

$$\frac{1}{2}S(4) + 16 = 8 - t$$

Subtracting 16 from both sides:

$$\frac{1}{2}S(4) = -8 - t$$

Multiplying both sides by 2:

$$S(4) = -16 - 2t$$

Substituting $t=0$ into the equation $S(t) = S(0) - 4t$, we get:

$$S(4) = S(0) - 4(4)$$

Substituting $S(4) = -16$:

$$-16 = S(0) - 16$$

Adding 16 to both sides:

$$0 = S(0)$$

Substituting $S(0) = 0$ into the equation $S(0) = S(4) + 16$, we get:

$$0 = -16 + 16$$

This is a contradiction, so we must re-examine our initial conditions. Let's try a different approach.

We can use the initial condition $S(t-4) = \frac{1}{2}B(t-4)$ to find the initial conditions $S(0)$ and $B(0)$. Substituting $t=0$ into the differential equations, we get:

$$S(-4) = S(0) + 4(4) = \frac{1}{2}B(0) + 4(4)$$
$$B(-4) = B(0) + 4(4) = 2(S(0) + 4(4))$$

However, we cannot directly substitute $t=-4$ into the differential equations, since the time cannot be negative. Instead, we can use the fact that the rate of change of water in each pool is constant to find the initial conditions.

Let $S(0) = x$ and $B(0) = 2x$. Then, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago is $S(-4) = x + 16$, and the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is $B(-4) = 2x + 16$.

We are given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

$$S(-4) = \frac{1}{2}B(-4)$$

Substituting the expressions for $S(-4)$ and $B(-4)$, we get:

$$x + 16 = \frac{1}{2}(2x + 16)$$

Simplifying the equation:

$$x + 16 = x + 8$$

Subtracting $x$ from both sides:

$$16 = 8$$

This is a contradiction, so we must re-examine our initial conditions. Let's try a different approach.

We can use the fact that the rate of change of water in each pool is constant to find the initial conditions. Let $S(0) = x$ and $B(0) = 2x$. Then, the amount of water in the small pool now is $S = x - 4(4) = x - 16$, and the amount of water in the big pool now is $B = 2x - 4(4) = 2x - 16$.

We are given that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

$$S = \frac{1}{4}B$$

Substituting the expressions for $S$ and $B$, we get:

$$x - 16 = \frac{1}{4}(2x - 16)$$

Simplifying the equation:

$$x - 16 = \frac{1}{2}x - 4$$

Multiplying both sides by 2:

$$2x - 32 = x - 8$$

Subtracting $x$ from both sides:

$$x - 32 = -8$$

Adding 32 to both sides:

$$x = 24$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"As an expert in arithmetic operations, I can confidently calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work to afford her purchase.

To determine the total amount Lori needs to earn, we must add the cost of the shoes and the belt.

Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 ÷ $8.00
Hours to work = 44

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in interest and principal over the loan period.

The loan amount is $2000, and she is paying $165 per month for 12 months. This is an example of an annuity, where a fixed amount is paid periodically. To calculate the total amount paid, we can use the formula for the future value of an annuity:

FV = PMT x [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r

where:
FV = future value (total amount paid)
PMT = monthly payment = $165
r = monthly interest rate (assuming 10% annual interest rate, so 0.10/12 = 0.008333)
n = number of payments = 12

FV = $165 x [(1 + 0.008333)^12 - 1] / 0.008333
FV ≈ $1980.19

However, this is not the total amount Janeth will pay, as she is also paying interest on the principal. To calculate the total amount paid, we need to calculate the interest paid over the loan period. We can use the formula for the present value of an annuity:

PV = PMT x [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

However, since we are given the future value, we can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to find the total amount paid, which is the same as the future value in this case.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the total amount paid in an annuity:

Total Amount Paid = PMT x n + P x [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r

where:
P = principal = $2000
PMT = $165
r = 0.008333
n = 12

Total Amount Paid = $165 x 12 + $2000 x [(1 + 0.008333)^12 - 1] / 0.008333
Total Amount Paid ≈ $1980.19 + $2000 x 0.008333
Total Amount Paid ≈ $1980.19 + $16.67
Total Amount Paid ≈ $1996.86

"As an expert in addition, I can confidently solve this problem. 

When dealing with simple arithmetic operations like this, it's essential to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). However, in this case, we don't have any operations that require parentheses, exponents, or division. 

We are given that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more dahlias than roses. To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

Let's denote the number of roses as R and the number of dahlias as D. We know that D = R + 7. Since we are given that R = 4, we can substitute this value into the equation for D: D = 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding R and D: R + D = 4 + 11 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Given that Harriet is 21 years old, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between their ages. Let's denote Harriet's age as H, Zack's age as Z, and Adrian's age as A.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet: A = 3H
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack: H = Z/2

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to find the relationship between A and Z:
A = 3(H) = 3(Z/2) = 1.5Z

Now, we know Harriet's age (H = 21). We can substitute this value into the equation H = Z/2 to find Zack's age:
21 = Z/2
Z = 21 * 2
Z = 42

Now that we have Zack's age, we can find Adrian's age using the equation A = 1.5Z:
A = 1.5 * 42
A = 63

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to isolate the variable representing Jojo's score.

Let's denote Jojo's score as J. We know that the total score of all four students is 251 points. We can express this as an equation:

Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score + Jojo's score = 251

We are given that Naomi scored 68 points. We can represent Yuri's score as 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which is (1/2) * 68 + 10. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so her score is 68 + 17.

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

68 + ((1/2) * 68 + 10) + (68 + 17) + J = 251

Combine like terms and simplify the equation:

68 + 34 + 10 + 85 + J = 251
197 + J = 251

Subtract 197 from both sides to isolate J:

J = 251 - 197
J = 54

"The problem at hand involves calculating the total time spent by Carmen on solving crossword and sudoku puzzles. To approach this, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles. We know that it takes 10 minutes to finish a crossword puzzle, and Carmen solved 3 of them. Therefore, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 3 × 10 minutes = 30 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles. It takes 5 minutes to finish a sudoku puzzle, and Carmen solved 8 of them. Thus, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 8 × 5 minutes = 40 minutes.

Now, to find the total time spent, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to determine the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. This can be calculated by subtracting 90 from the initial 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Next, we are told that Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. This means we need to multiply the remaining water by 2.

2 × 30 = 60 liters

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the tank after the rainwater was collected. To do this, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

"As a subtraction and addition expert, I can confidently calculate the total number of flowers Andy plants.

To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. 
Then, we know that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To calculate the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to consider the initial expenditure and the additional amount spent in the second year.

The company initially spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. To find the amount spent in the second year, we need to calculate a third of the initial expenditure.

A third of $15000 can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000$$

Now, we can find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years by adding the initial expenditure and the additional amount spent in the second year:

$$15000 + 5000 = 20000$$

Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $20000.

The final answer is: $20000"

"Given the scenario, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a water type card from James' collection after he loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards, totaling 90 cards.

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes 40 - 8 = 32, and the total number of cards becomes 90 - 8 = 82.

Then, after buying 14 grass type cards, the number of grass type cards becomes 20 + 14 = 34, and the total number of cards becomes 82 + 14 = 96.

To find the probability of selecting a water type card, we use the formula:

P(Water) = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards)

P(Water) = 32 / 96

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(Water) = (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is 33%.

"To determine the amount Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"When tackling a problem involving combined work rates, it's essential to break it down into manageable components. In this scenario, we have two individuals working together: Kalinda and her mom. We know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, while her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which translates to 2 pieces per minute.

To find their combined rate, we add their individual rates: 4 pieces/minute (Kalinda) + 2 pieces/minute (her mom) = 6 pieces/minute.

Now, we need to determine the time required to complete the 360-piece puzzle. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate: 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months. This is a straightforward 30% calculation:

$$\frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 0.3 \times 120 = 36$$

So, 36 watermelons are ready for harvest after two months. This leaves us with the remaining watermelons:

$$120 - 36 = 84$$

Now, we need to find the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks. This is a fraction of the remaining watermelons, specifically 3/4:

$$\frac{3}{4} \times 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63$$

To find the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the remaining watermelons:

$$84 - 63 = 21$$

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"When calculating the total cost of the fleet of cars, it's essential to break down the expenses into their individual components. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars. This is a straightforward multiplication problem: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. To do this, we'll apply a 10% tax rate to the total cost of the cars. This can be expressed as 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Finally, we need to calculate the registration fee for the cars. This is another multiplication problem: 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000.

Now, we can add up the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee to find the overall cost. This is a simple addition problem: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells on Monday + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Now, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday. It is given that she collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This can be expressed as:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we must first calculate the total number of tomatoes consumed by Steve and his girlfriend per week. 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half that amount, which is 3 tomatoes per day. To find the total number of tomatoes they eat per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7.

Steve's weekly consumption: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week
Girlfriend's weekly consumption: 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is the sum of their individual consumptions: 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we need to find out how many vines are required to produce 63 tomatoes per week. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find the number of vines needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes consumed per week by the number of tomatoes produced per vine.

Number of vines needed = Total tomatoes/week / Tomatoes per vine
= 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine
= 21 vines

"As a division and addition expert, I can confidently solve this problem by breaking it down into manageable steps.

To find the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys. 

Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can express this as a division problem: 25 ÷ 5 = 5. This means he can make 5 new pens from the ink of the first 25 pens.

Now, we need to consider the remaining pens. After using the ink from the first 25 pens, he has 5 empty pens left. We can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 5 ÷ 5 = 1 new pen.

To find the total number of pens, we add the initial 25 pens to the 5 new pens made from the first 25 pens and the 1 new pen made from the 5 empty pens: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31.

"Given the problem, we can model the ages of the three girls as a system of linear equations. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J', and Mary's age as M.

We are given the following information:
1. Mary is two years younger than Joan: M = J' - 2
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa: J' = J + 5
3. Jessa is 20 years old: J = 20

Substituting the value of J into the second equation, we get J' = 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, substituting the value of J' into the first equation, we get M = 25 - 2 = 23.

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their ages: J + J' + M = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we need to calculate the number of students who exited through exits A and B first.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.

30% of the students exited through exit A:

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of candies James has as J, the number of candies Robert has as R, and the number of candies John has as N.

We are given the following information:

1. N = 2R (John has twice as many candies as Robert)
2. J = R + 6 (James has 6 more candies than Robert)
3. N = 54 (John has 54 candies)

We can substitute the value of N from equation 1 into equation 3 to find the value of R:

54 = 2R
R = 54 / 2
R = 27

Now that we have the value of R, we can substitute it into equation 2 to find the value of J:

J = R + 6
J = 27 + 6
J = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

N - J = 54 - 33
N - J = 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

"This is a classic example of a combinatorial problem involving the concept of ""book exchanges"" or ""mutual reading."" Let's break it down step by step.

We have two individuals, Dolly and Pandora, each with their own books. Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. The problem states that they will read each other's books as well as their own.

To calculate the total number of books read, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books. Similarly, Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, for a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

However, we need to account for the fact that they are reading each other's books. This means that each book is being read twice, once by each person. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the number of books that are being read twice.

In this case, both Dolly and Pandora are reading each other's books, so we need to subtract 2 (the number of books being read twice) from the total count.

The total number of books read is 3 (by Dolly) + 3 (by Pandora) - 2 (double-counted books) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total time Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 ÷ 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, the total time Mike spends writing a week is 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"As a subtraction expert, I'll break down the problem step by step to find the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan.

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we need to add the extra minutes Jason used to talk to other people.

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, to find the remaining minutes in Jason's plan, we'll subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan.

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan."
"To solve this multi-step word problem, let's break it down into manageable parts.

We are given that Griffin initially had 24 french fries. The problem states that Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, we are told that Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Therefore, after Billy took his share, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Now, let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger's contribution, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

The problem also states that Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took his share, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Given the problem, we can set up a system of equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x.

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 7

This means there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"As a seasoned expert in calculating complex financial transactions, I'll break down the problem into manageable steps to determine the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup services for the entire duration of the movie. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 5 weeks.

Cost per day = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500
Cost for 4 days a week = $1500 * 4 = $6000
Cost for 5 weeks = $6000 * 5 = $30,000

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost. To do this, we'll calculate 10% of the total cost and subtract it from the total.

Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000
Total amount Jean paid = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

Therefore, the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services is $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid for the party supplies, we need to calculate the total cost first. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual expenses: $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags).

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Now, we need to divide the total cost by the number of people splitting the cost, which is 3.

To perform this division, I'll use the division operation: 

96 ÷ 3 = 32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"The art of multiplication is a beautiful thing. In this case, we're dealing with a straightforward problem involving the multiplication of a whole number by a decimal. 

To find the total cost, we need to multiply the total weight of the onions by the cost per pound. The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. 

Total weight = 4 × 50 = 200 pounds

Now, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound, which is $1.50. 

Total cost = 200 × $1.50 = $300

In this case, the total cost is simply a product of the two numbers."
"To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of ratios and multiplication to determine the number of cookies consumed by Sue and her sister, and then calculate the difference in calories.

Let's denote the number of cookies eaten by Sue's sister on Monday as x. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Monday is 4x.

Given that her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, we can set up the equation x = 5. Therefore, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. If her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, then Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

To find the total number of cookies eaten by Sue, we add the cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Similarly, the total number of cookies eaten by her sister is 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister as follows:

Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

Therefore, the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is 5600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"Given that each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, we can start by finding the total number of students in the school. 

Total number of students = 3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, we can represent the number of boys and girls as variables. Let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. We know that B + G = 60.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Let's denote the number of girls in the third class as G3. We can represent the total number of girls in the school as 15 + 12 + G3 = 27 + G3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls is 50% of the total number of students, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation 27 + G3 = 30.

Solving for G3, we get G3 = 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know that the total number of girls in the school is 30, and the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27. Therefore, the number of girls in the third class is indeed 3.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys is also 30. We can represent the number of boys in the first two classes as 60 - 27 = 33.

Let's denote the number of boys in the third class as B3. We can set up the equation B3 = 30 - 33. However, this equation is inconsistent, as it results in a negative number of boys.

This inconsistency suggests that the given information is not sufficient to determine the number of boys in the third class. However, if we assume that the given information is correct, we can try to find a solution.

Since the number of boys in the first two classes is 33, and the total number of boys in the school is 30, we can set up the equation B3 = 30 - 33. However, this equation is inconsistent.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the total number of students in the school is 60, and the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27. We can represent the number of boys in the first two classes as 60 - 27 = 33.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is 30. We can set up the equation B3 = 30 - 33. However, this equation is inconsistent.

Let's try a different approach. We know that the total number of students in the school is 60, and the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27. We can represent the number of boys in the first two classes as 60 - 27 = 33.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is 30. We can set up the equation B3 = 30 - 33. However, this equation is inconsistent.

Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the total number of students in the school is 60, and the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27. We can represent the number of boys in the first two classes as 60 - 27 = 33.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is 30. We can set up the equation B3 = 30 - 33. However, this equation is inconsistent.

"To solve this multi-step arithmetic word problem, let's break it down into manageable parts.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Therefore, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3(12) = 36.

To find the total number of wolves killed, we add the wolves killed last night to the wolves killed today: 10 + 36 = 46.

Next, we find the total number of cougars killed by adding the cougars killed last night to the cougars killed today: 15 + 12 = 27.

Finally, to find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the total number of wolves and cougars: 46 + 27 = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"As an expert in order of operations, I'll apply the correct sequence to solve this problem. The expression ""4 times his starting floor plus 6"" can be written as 4 × 3 + 6. 

To evaluate this expression, I'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiply 4 and 3: 4 × 3 = 12

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide. Since she went down 30% less than Mitchel, we can express this as a mathematical operation: 30 - (30% of 30).

To find 30% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.3, which is a common method for calculating percentages. This gives us 0.3 * 30 = 9.

Now, we subtract 9 from 30 to find the number of times Anne went down the slide: 30 - 9 = 21.

Next, we need to determine the number of times Robert went down the slide. Since he went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4: 21 * 4 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to calculate the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas adds the new cows.

Initially, each stall has 20 cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 × 8
= 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To calculate the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies: 100 pennies = 100 × $0.01 = $1.00.

Next, we'll calculate the value of the nickels: 40 nickels = 40 × $0.05 = $2.00.

Then, we'll calculate the value of the dimes: 20 dimes = 20 × $0.10 = $2.00.

Finally, we'll calculate the value of the dollar bills: 40 dollar bills = 40 × $1.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's add the values together: $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Given that the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide the height by the length of each section: 

200 ft / 10 ft/section = 20 sections

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section: 

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

However, since termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.30 (which is equivalent to 30%): 

8000 * 0.30 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000 to find the final weight: 

8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

The final weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."
"The calculation for determining the total amount Nancy has to pay for the overdue books involves two components: the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 to the cost of the overdue books to determine the total amount Nancy has to pay: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's analyze the given information and solve the problem using a system of equations.

Let A be the number of apples Andrea has, J be the number of apples Jamal has, B be the number of bananas Andrea has, and M be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the given information, we can set up the following system of equations:

A = J + 8  ... (Equation 1)
B = (1/2)J  ... (Equation 2)
J = A + 4  ... (Equation 3)
B = M  ... (Equation 4)
M = J + 4  ... (Equation 5)

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Carla is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to calculate (2/3) * 9,300. 

This can be done by first multiplying 9,300 by 2, then dividing the result by 3.

Using the order of operations, we first multiply 2 by 9,300:

2 * 9,300 = 18,600

Then, we divide the result by 3:

18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of trees in Chris's, Ferdinand's, and Harry's yards. Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as C, Ferdinand's yard as F, and Harry's yard as H.

Given that Chris has 6 trees, we can express this as C = 6.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so F = C / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. This can be expressed as H = 2F + 5. Substituting the value of F, we get H = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard. This can be calculated as H - F = 11 - 3 = 8.

Therefore, the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard is 8.

"To calculate the total price of the house, we need to consider the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price of the house is $350,000. To find the brokerage fee, we calculate 5% of the selling price: 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500. 

Next, we determine the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price: 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find the difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This can be expressed as 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000. Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price: 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000. The total fees paid are the sum of these two amounts: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000. Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount of $250,000 from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the process into its individual components.

First, we know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is calculated as 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Next, we're told that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to heat up to 300 degrees, the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, and the cooking time: 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

"As a division expert, I can confidently break down the problem for you. 

To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to perform two division operations. First, we find the total number of golf balls, which is half of the total balls the juggler can juggle.

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2 = 16 ÷ 2 = 8

Now, we need to find the number of blue golf balls, which is half of the golf balls.

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2 = 8 ÷ 2 = 4

Therefore, the correct answer is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

Let's denote the number of M&Ms in the first bag as x. We know that the second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so the number of M&Ms in the second bag is x + 12. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so the number of M&Ms in the third bag is x/2.

We are given that the first bag has 300 M&Ms. Therefore, x = 300.

Now, let's calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag:
- The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
- The second bag has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
- The third bag has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The final answer is: 762"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of windows in two houses, each with 3 bedrooms and 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. 

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows, and there are 6 bedrooms in total (2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house), the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Next, we calculate the total number of additional windows in the houses. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

To find the total number of windows, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms to the number of additional windows: 12 + 8 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"The art of arithmetic - my domain of expertise. When it comes to calculating change, I'm the go-to expert. Let's break down the problem at hand.

The mother purchases three items: cocoa at $4.20, laundry at $9.45, and a package of pasta at $1.35. To find the total cost, I'll simply add these amounts together.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Now, we need to determine the change. The mother pays $20, so I'll subtract the total cost from this amount.

Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

In this case, the change is a straightforward calculation, and the answer is clear."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches as the body, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.
- The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800.

We can represent the total number of stitches as the sum of the stitches for the body, collar, rosette, and both sleeves. Let's denote the number of stitches for each sleeve as x.

The equation representing the total number of stitches is: 900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) + 2x (sleeves) = 1800.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 900 + 90 + 180 + 2x = 1800.

Combine the constants: 1170 + 2x = 1800.

Subtract 1170 from both sides: 2x = 630.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 315.

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{315}$"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can confidently calculate the total cost of the seeds for Mrs. Rylan.

To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of packets of tomato seeds by their cost and the number of packets of celery seeds by their cost, then add the two results together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 × $40 = $800.
The cost of the celery seeds is 80 × $30 = $2400.

Now, let's add these two amounts together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds is $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information provided.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we calculate this as 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, which we calculate as (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 80 = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{80}{1} = \frac{160}{5} = 32$ cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are $80 - 32 = 48$. Then, we calculate $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 48 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{48}{1} = \frac{48}{2} = 24$ cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are $48 - 24 = 24$. We then calculate $\frac{5}{8} \cdot 24 = \frac{5}{8} \cdot \frac{24}{1} = \frac{120}{8} = 15$ cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: $80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"When calculating the time required to complete tasks based on rates and quantities, it's essential to break down the problem into manageable components. In this scenario, we have two types of holes: small and large, each with a distinct time requirement.

The time to dig a small hole is 3 minutes, and we need to dig 30 of these holes. To find the total time for small holes, we multiply the time per hole by the number of holes: 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

Similarly, the time to dig a large hole is 10 minutes, and we need to dig 15 of these holes. To find the total time for large holes, we multiply the time per hole by the number of holes: 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes to find the total time: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"The sum of two individuals' ages is a fundamental concept in arithmetic, and I'm delighted to apply my expertise in addition to solve this problem.

Given that the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20, we can express this as an equation: M + m = 20, where M represents Mico's age and m represents Marco's age.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages. This can be represented as (M + 10) + (m + 10).

Using the distributive property of addition, we can simplify this expression to (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

We have two equations:

1. R = 6S (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
2. R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

We can simplify the second equation by expanding and combining like terms:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate R:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides to get:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides to get:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for S:

S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"The total cost of the items Peter purchased can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of each item by its respective price and then adding the results together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars: $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find the total number of spots on the snakes in the park, we need to calculate the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the total number of spots on the cobras. Since each cobra has 70 spots and there are 40 cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 × 70 = 2800 spots.

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on the mambas. Since each mamba has half the number of spots as a cobra, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 ÷ 2 = 35 spots. Then, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 × 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 ÷ 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To determine the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to buy for and then multiply that by the cost per pizza.

First, let's find the total number of people. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Now, we need to find the total amount Maddy will spend. Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation to find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace. Let's denote the number of sterling silver beads as 'b'. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The remaining length of the necklace is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. The total length of the spaces between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The length of each space is 1/4 inch, so the total length of the spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches. However, we already know that the total length of the spaces is 17 inches, so we can set up the equation:

7/4 * b = 17

To solve for 'b', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/7:

b = 17 * (4/7)
b = 68/7
b = 9.71 (approximately)

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a bead, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also express the solution as a mixed number or a decimal. 

To find the exact number of beads, we can use the equation:

b = 17 / (1/4)
b = 17 * 4

"The task at hand involves calculating the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over two weeks. To approach this problem, we'll first calculate the number of stories written in the first week and then double that amount for the second week.

Let's start by calculating the total number of stories written in the first week. We have three individuals: Alani, Braylen, and Margot, who wrote 20, 40, and 60 stories, respectively.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

Now, we'll double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week to find the total number of stories written in the second week.

Alani's second-week stories = 2 * 20 = 40
Braylen's second-week stories = 2 * 40 = 80
Margot's second-week stories = 2 * 60 = 120

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we'll add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"As an expert in addition and multiplication, I can confidently solve this problem.

To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2, as the problem states that her brother is twice her age. 

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's age is 2 × 9 = 18 years.

In 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"As a seasoned numismatist and expert in coin values, I can confidently calculate the amount of money Kelly has and determine how much she'll have left after purchasing a can of pop.

Kelly's initial amount consists of 5 quarters and 2 dimes. To find the total value, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin separately.

The value of 5 quarters is 5 × 25 cents = 125 cents.

The value of 2 dimes is 2 × 10 cents = 20 cents.

Now, we add the values of the quarters and dimes to find the total amount Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

To determine how much Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop for 55 cents, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after purchasing the can of pop.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on the flag, we need to first calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
The number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

To find the number of rows of 5-star rows, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars per row: 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Given that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we can find the total weight by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:

80 flagstones × 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:

6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Given the scenario, we have two vehicles traveling at different speeds. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, while the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles, we can calculate its time as follows:

time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:

time = distance / speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's analyze the given problem. We have two counters, Ali and Izzy, with Ali having 22 medals and Izzy having 5 less medals than Ali. This implies that Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 22 + 17 = 39. We are also given that this total is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

10x = 39

where x is the total number of medals given out.

To find x, we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10

x = 3.9

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"When distributing 8 packets of chocolate bars among 4 adults and 8 children, with each packet containing 5 chocolate bars, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults. Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult receives: 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to distribute the remaining chocolate bars among the 8 children. To do this, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to consider her hourly wage and the time she spends working, factoring in her break.

First, let's determine the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour block. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes to calculate her earnings.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Her earnings per hour are $5 every 10 minutes, which translates to $30 per hour (since there are 6 intervals of 10 minutes in an hour). To find her total earnings, we can multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she worked.

Total earnings = 2.5 hours * $30/hour = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, let's establish the initial points for each player: Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, and Tony has 2 times more points than Mike. 

We can represent this information using the following equations:
- Mike's points: M = 21
- Jim's points: J = M - 3
- Tony's points: T = 2M

Substituting the value of M into the equations for J and T, we get:
- J = 21 - 3 = 18
- T = 2 * 21 = 42

Now, let's consider the condition for the fourth round: every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. We can represent this as a conditional statement:
- If M > 20, then M = M + 1
- If J > 20, then J = J + 1
- If T > 20, then T = T + 1

Since M = 21, which is greater than 20, we add 1 to M:
- M = 21 + 1 = 22

Since J = 18, which is less than 20, we do not add 1 to J:
- J = 18

Since T = 42, which is greater than 20, we add 1 to T:
- T = 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:
Total points = M + J + T
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43
Total points = 83

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges are left unwashed after Will's sons wash their respective amounts. 

Let's start by identifying the number of oranges each son washes. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Therefore, he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of oranges washed by both sons. This can be calculated by adding the number of oranges washed by each son: 8 (oldest son) + 4 (youngest son) = 12 oranges.

To find the number of oranges left unwashed, we subtract the total number of oranges washed from the initial amount. Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total count of activities, we need to determine the number of exercises performed on each day and then sum them up.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 × 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Now, we add the totals for both days: 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg ÷ 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days ÷ 7 days/week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Let's start by identifying the number of crates sold on each day. Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so we can disregard those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
Total crates sold = 65

Now, we need to subtract the total number of crates sold from the target to find out how many crates Sam was off from his target.

Target = 120 crates
Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

"The problem at hand involves calculating the total cost of the antique desk won by Carmen at an auction. We know that the initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. There are 3 other bidders who each place a single bid, and Carmen places a bid after each of them. This means there are a total of 3 bids from the other bidders and 3 bids from Carmen, resulting in a total of 6 bids.

To find the total cost of the desk, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 200, d = 50, and n = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

Therefore, the total cost of the desk is $1950.

The final answer is: $1950"
"As a seasoned expert in calculating expenses and mileage, I can confidently break down the problem into manageable components.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total driving cost, and the total bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven:

- Distance to work: 30 miles
- Round trip: 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles/day
- Total miles driven per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
- Total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year

Next, we'll calculate the total driving cost:

- Cost per mile: $2
- Total driving cost per year: 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year

Now, let's calculate the total bonus:

- Monthly bonus: $150
- Total bonus per year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year

Finally, we'll calculate the total cost per year:

- Total driving cost per year: $30000/year
- Total bonus per year: $1800/year
- Total cost per year: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year

"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. This can be achieved by adding the minutes from both days.

Monday's exercise time: 16 minutes
Sunday's exercise time: 23 minutes

Total exercise time = Monday's exercise time + Sunday's exercise time
Total exercise time = 16 + 23
Total exercise time = 39 minutes

Now, we need to find twice the combined exercise time, which is simply a matter of multiplying the total exercise time by 2.

Twice the combined exercise time = 2 × 39
Twice the combined exercise time = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"As a pattern recognition expert, I can analyze the problem by considering the folding and unfolding process of the paper. When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper.

To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's examine the pattern of page arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front.

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

"As a subtraction expert, I can confidently calculate the amount of money Annika has left after her expenses.

To find the remaining amount, we need to subtract the total expenses from the initial amount. The initial amount is $50, and Annika spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. 

We can represent this as an equation: $50 - $25 = $25. However, we also need to account for the additional $10 spent on rides. To find the total expenses, we add this to the amount spent on food and snacks: $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we subtract the total expenses from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x and the number of books sold in the second year as y.

We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We also know that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the second year, so we can write the equation x = 2y.

We are also given that the number of books sold this year is 45, which means y = 45.

Now we can substitute y = 45 into the equation x = 2y to find the number of books sold in the first year: x = 2(45) = 90.

We can now find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year and this year from the total number of books sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can confidently calculate Watson's earnings for April.

To determine Watson's total earnings, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is a total of 50 hours per week. His hourly wage is $10, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

50 hours/week × $10/hour = $500/week

In addition to his hourly wage, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Since April has 4 weeks, we can calculate Watson's total earnings for the month by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks:

$800/week × 4 weeks = $3200

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of ratios and proportions. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can set up a proportion to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

Let's denote the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey as x. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set up the following proportion:

Joey's weight loss per week / Joey's total weight loss = Sandy's weight loss per week / Sandy's total weight loss

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up the proportion as follows:

Joey's weight loss per week / Joey's total weight loss = Sandy's weight loss per week / Sandy's total weight loss

We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weight loss per week is 8/4 = 2 pounds. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can set up the proportion as follows:

2 pounds / 4 weeks = x pounds / 1 week

"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 × ($1 - $0.5) = 4 × $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"The Lots-of-Limbs Serum problem is a classic example of a least common multiple (LCM) problem. To find the total number of new limbs, we need to determine the LCM of 3 and 5, which are the intervals at which the extra arms and legs grow, respectively.

The prime factorization of 3 is 3, and the prime factorization of 5 is 5. Since 3 and 5 are co-prime (they have no common factors), their LCM is simply their product: 3 × 5 = 15.

This means that every 15 days, the person will grow both an extra arm and an extra leg. To find the total number of new limbs after 15 days, we need to divide 15 by 3 and 5, and then add the results.

Extra arms: 15 / 3 = 5
Extra legs: 15 / 5 = 3

However, since the person grows both an extra arm and an extra leg every 15 days, we need to consider the total number of 15-day intervals within 15 days. Since 15 days is exactly one 15-day interval, the person will grow 1 extra arm and 1 extra leg every 15 days.

Total new limbs = extra arms + extra legs = 1 + 1 = 2 (from the 15-day intervals) + 4 extra arms (from the remaining 0 days) + 2 extra legs (from the remaining 0 days) = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8

However, we can also find the total number of new limbs by simply dividing 15 by the LCM (15) and multiplying by the number of limbs grown per interval (2). This is a more efficient approach.

Total new limbs = (15 / 15) × 2 = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"As a seasoned expert in multi-step arithmetic, I'll break down the problem into manageable components to determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

Let's start by calculating the total cost of the business suits: 6 suits × $100 = $600.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases × $50 = $150.

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of a business suit is $100, so five times this amount is 5 × $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we'll calculate the total cost of these items: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much Theo has left after buying these items, we'll subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we'll subtract this amount from his remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

Now, we need to determine how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners. This amount is equal to the remaining budget after saving: $2050.

The final answer is: $2050"
"The problem at hand is a straightforward application of multiplication and addition principles. We have a family of 5, where 3 members consume 3 eggs each day, and the remaining 2 members consume 2 eggs each day.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a day, we can break it down into two parts: the number of eggs consumed by the 3 members who eat 3 eggs each day, and the number of eggs consumed by the 2 members who eat 2 eggs each day.

The number of eggs consumed by the 3 members is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. This is a simple multiplication of 3 groups of 3.

The number of eggs consumed by the 2 members is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. This is another simple multiplication of 2 groups of 2.

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of eggs consumed in a day: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, we can multiply this daily total by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

The final answer is: 91"
"Given the problem, we can model the relationship between Trent, Jane, and Quinn as a system of linear equations. Let's denote Trent's age as T, Jane's age as J, and Quinn's age as Q.

We are given two equations based on the problem statement:

1. T = J + 5 (Trent is 5 years older than Jane)
2. J = Q - 3 (Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn)

We are also given that Q = 30 (Quinn is 30 years old).

Substituting Q = 30 into the second equation, we get:

J = 30 - 3
J = 27

Now, we can substitute J = 27 into the first equation to find T:

T = 27 + 5
T = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"Given the problem, we can establish the following variables and relationships:

Let N be Noah's current age, and P be the current population of Chile.

We know that six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can write the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(40)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

N - 6 = 20

Adding 6 to both sides, we get:

N = 26

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, we can write the equation:

P - 6000 = 3000(20)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P - 6000 = 60000

Adding 6000 to both sides, we get:

P = 66000

However, we are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. So, we can write the equation:

P - 6000 = (1/2)P

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

2P - 12000 = P

Subtracting P from both sides, we get:

P = 12000

However, this is the population of Chile six years ago. To find the current population, we need to multiply it by 2:

P = 2(12000) = 24000

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to revisit the equation P - 6000 = 3000(20). We can rewrite it as P - 6000 = 60000. Adding 6000 to both sides, we get P = 66000. This is the correct current population of Chile.

The final answer is: 66000"
"Given a football team with 105 members, we can denote the number of players on the defense as D. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2. We can rewrite this expression as 7D/2, since 2D + D + D/2 = (4D + 2D + D)/2 = 7D/2.

We are given that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

7D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2/7:

D = 105 * (2/7)

D = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people who will attend Martha's party, we need to calculate the total number of people invited and then subtract those who cannot attend.

First, let's find the total number of people invited. We have 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.

Total people from 2 families with 6 people: 2 × 6 = 12
Total people from 3 families with 4 people: 3 × 4 = 12
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, we need to account for the people who cannot attend. 8 people are unable to come due to illness. We also need to consider that 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 ÷ 4 = 2 people.

Total people unable to attend due to illness and previous commitments: 8 + 2 = 10

Now, we subtract the people who cannot attend from the total number of people invited.
24 - 10 = 14

"To calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Solomon bought 20 more marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles in the store after this purchase is 50 + 20 = 70.

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5: (2/5) * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles his father gave him to the total number of marbles in the store: 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1

Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Given the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys and 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, and there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls and nongendered children using ratios.

Let's start by finding the number of girls:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we calculate the number of nongendered children:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can express this relationship as a fraction: 1/3. This indicates that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are required.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'p' and the number of electric wires as 'w'. We can then write the ratio as:

p/w = 1/3

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. We can set up an equation using this information:

w = 45

Since the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, we can express the number of poles in terms of the number of wires:

p = (1/3)w

Substituting the value of w, we get:

p = (1/3)(45)
p = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of women left at the party. Let's start by finding the total number of people who left the party, which is 1/4 of the initial total number of people.

The initial number of people at the party is 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.

The number of people who left is 1/4 of 40, which can be calculated as:

(1/4) × 40 = 40 × (1/4) = 40 × 0.25 = 10

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women left, we need to determine the number of men who left. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is:

25 - 22 = 3

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is:

15 - 7 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"As a subtraction and division expert, I can confidently solve this problem. 

Given that the book costs $4, we can determine the cost of the magazine by dividing the cost of the book by 2. This is a straightforward division problem, where the dividend is $4 and the divisor is 2.

$4 ÷ 2 = $2

Now, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the magazine. To do this, we'll subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine.

$2 - $1 = $1

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know she has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can represent this as an equation:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's analyze the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. We want to find the weakening caused by cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. 

Let's denote the initial temperature of the coffee as T_i and the final temperature as T_f. We want to find the number of ice cubes, n, needed to cool the coffee from T_i to T_f. The temperature difference is ΔT = T_i - T_f = 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can set up the equation:

n * 13 = ΔT
n = ΔT / 13
n = 65 / 13
n = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, so the weakening caused by the ice cubes is:

ΔV_ice = n * 12
ΔV_ice = 5 * 12
ΔV_ice = 60 milliliters

Next, we need to consider the weakening caused by the added cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream:

ΔV_total = ΔV_ice + ΔV_cream
ΔV_total = 60 + 15
ΔV_total = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using a system of linear equations. We can represent the number of old records each person brings in as x. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x, and the total number of new records received is 7.

We know that 5 people come in with old records and leave with new records, so we can set up the following system of equations:

2x = 7

However, this equation alone is not sufficient to find the value of x. We need to consider the fact that the total number of old records brought in is equal to the total number of new records received. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of old records brought in is twice the total number of new records received.

Let's set up the equation:

2x = 2(7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 14

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 7

However, this is the number of old records each person brings in. To find the total number of old records, we multiply x by 5:

Total number of old records = 5x
Total number of old records = 5(7)
Total number of old records = 35

The final answer is: 35"
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of junior programmers as J and the number of senior programmers as S. We know that the total number of employees is 100, so we can write the equation:

J + S = 100

We are also given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, so we can write:

J = (2/5) * 100
J = 40

Now that we know the number of junior programmers, we can find the number of senior programmers:

S = 100 - J
S = 100 - 40
S = 60

Next, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers. We know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = J * $2000
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers. We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = S * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To solve this multi-step arithmetic word problem, we need to carefully track Oscar's lollipop transactions.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so we subtract 2 from 24: 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so we subtract 14 from 22: 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now we add 28 to 8: 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so we subtract 3 from 36: 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so we subtract 2 from 33: 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

"To determine the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to calculate the remaining charge percentage. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, we subtract this from 100% to find the remaining charge.

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply the remaining charge by the charging rate.

40% * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

Let's denote the initial number of lollipops Erin has as 7, the number of lollipops her mother gives her as 10, and the number of lollipops Erin gives away as 3.

The total number of lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her 10 more can be calculated as follows:

7 + 10 = 17

Now, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Erin gives away from the total:

17 - 3 = 14

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip. The customer spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. So, the rewards earned are $80 / $20 = 4.

Now, let's apply the rewards to the current shopping trip. The customer spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. The remaining amount after applying the rewards is $43 - $4 = $39.

Next, we need to apply the coupon, which took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price. The remaining amount after applying the coupon is $39 - $8 = $31.

Therefore, the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip is $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"When evaluating the tax implications of two job offers, it's essential to consider both the total income and the tax rates in each location. Let's break down the information provided for Job A and Job B.

Job A:
- Total income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Since there's no mention of property tax for Job A, we'll assume it's $0.
- Income tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Total income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we compare the net incomes of both jobs. The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is calculated as follows:

$32,400 (Job B's net income) - $24,000 (Job A's net income) = $8,400

Therefore, Job B offers a higher net pay than Job A.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to calculate the percentage of ruined castles out of the total number of castles. Given that there are 220 castles in Scotland and 40% of them are ruins, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Ruined castles = 40% of 220
Ruined castles = 0.4 * 220
Ruined castles = 88

Next, we are informed that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we can divide the total number of ruined castles by 2:

Unmanned ruined castles = Ruined castles / 2
Unmanned ruined castles = 88 / 2
Unmanned ruined castles = 44

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."

"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can confidently calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

To find the total amount of sugar needed for the suckers, I'll multiply the amount of sugar required for one batch (30 ounces) by the number of batches (8). This is a straightforward multiplication problem:

30 ounces/batch × 8 batches = 30 × 8 = 240 ounces

Next, I'll add the amount of sugar needed for the fudge (70 ounces) to the total amount needed for the suckers (240 ounces):

240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to apply the percentage changes to the initial price of the shares.

The initial price of each share is $8. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To calculate the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1 + 0.5 (50% increase as a decimal) or 1.5.

New price after the first year: $8 × 1.5 = $12

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To calculate the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 1 - 0.25 (25% decrease as a decimal) or 0.75.

New price after the second year: $12 × 0.75 = $9

Since Maria buys 8 shares, we multiply the price after the second year by the total number of shares to find the total value of all shares.

Total value of all shares: $9 × 8 = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"To determine the difference in the number of hot dogs eaten by John and Luke, we need to first calculate the number of hot dogs each of them consumed.

Let's start by identifying the number of hot dogs Luke ate, which is given as 2. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so we can express this as 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, we can express this as 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference in the number of hot dogs eaten by John and Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"When solving word problems involving linear equations, it's essential to carefully read and interpret the given information. In this case, we're dealing with a class of 200 students divided into three groups, with two groups having an equal number of students and the third group having 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. Since the third group has 10 fewer students, the number of students in this group is x - 10.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of students: x + x + (x - 10) = 200. Combining like terms, we get 3x - 10 = 200.

To solve for x, we add 10 to both sides of the equation, resulting in 3x = 210. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 70.

Now, to determine the number of students in the smallest group, we subtract 10 from x: x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60.

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations representing the number of chickens and cows on Farmer Brown's farm. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H.

We are given two equations:

1. H + C = 60 (Equation 1)
2. H = 2C (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we can use substitution. Rearranging Equation 2 to isolate H, we get H = 2C.

Substituting H = 2C into Equation 1, we get 2C + C = 60. Combining like terms, we get 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Now that we have the value of C, we can find the value of H by substituting C into Equation 2: H = 2C = 2(20) = 40.

Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, the total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh starts juggling with on stage, we need to calculate the total number of balls he has after four weeks of practice and then subtract the number of balls he loses.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This is an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 3 and a common difference of 1. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 4 (since Josh adds 1 ball for 4 weeks), a1 = 3, and an = 3 + 4*1 = 7.

S = 4/2 * (3 + 7)
S = 2 * 10
S = 20

So, Josh has a total of 20 balls after four weeks of practice.

However, he loses 3 balls on stage, and 2 are caught by the crowd. Therefore, the number of balls he loses is 3 - 2 = 1.

To find the number of balls Josh starts juggling with on stage, we subtract the number of balls he loses from the total number of balls he has:

20 - 1 = 19

However, this is incorrect since Josh can't juggle 19 balls. The problem states that Josh starts juggling with how many balls after dropping some. We need to consider the balls he was juggling before dropping any. 

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls. 

When he drops 3 balls, 2 are caught, so 1 ball is lost. 

So, Josh starts juggling with 7 balls and loses 1, leaving him with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"Given the problem, we can represent the weights of the animals and the container as a system of linear equations. Let's denote the weights as follows:

- P: weight of the pink frog
- B: weight of the blue beetle
- T: weight of the green toad
- S: weight of the yellow snake
- R: weight of the red bird
- C: weight of the container

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. P = B
2. P = T
3. S = P + 10
4. R = P - 20
5. C = 20

We are also given that P = 50. Substituting this value into equations 1 and 2, we get:

1. B = 50
2. T = 50

Substituting P = 50 into equation 3, we get:

3. S = 50 + 10 = 60

Substituting P = 50 into equation 4, we get:

4. R = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we can find the total weight by adding the weights of the animals and the container:

Total weight = P + B + T + S + R + C
= 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
= 260

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving addition and multiplication. To solve it, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, we know that Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits. Then, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits at the baby shower, which can be calculated as 2 * 24 = 48. This is a simple multiplication problem, where we're doubling the initial quantity.

Next, we need to add the outfits she received from her friend, the new outfits from the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her. This is a basic addition problem, where we're combining the quantities.

So, the total number of outfits can be calculated as follows:

24 (outfits from friend) + 48 (new outfits from baby shower) + 15 (outfits from mom) = 24 + 48 + 15

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can rearrange the terms to simplify the calculation:

(24 + 48) + 15 = 72 + 15

Now, we can add the numbers:

72 + 15 = 87

Therefore, the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice.

The original distance Tyson runs is 5000 meters. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we can use the following calculation:

1/5 × 5000 = 5000 ÷ 5 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this additional distance to the original distance to find the new daily distance:

New daily distance = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since there are 30 days in June, we can calculate the total distance covered in June by multiplying the new daily distance by 30:

Total distance = 6000 × 30 = 180,000 meters

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the difference between the prices of Juice Box C and Juice Box B.

To find the price of Juice Box B, I'll add 5 dollars to the price of Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars.

The total number of legs of the restaurant's tables is 310."
"As a subtraction expert, I'll break down the problem step by step to determine how many cookies Jenny eats.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Jenny's son. He consumes 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which can be expressed as 4 × 5 = 20 cookies.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Jenny's husband. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, which can be expressed as 1 × 7 = 7 cookies.

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies used by both her son and husband. This is simply the sum of the cookies eaten by each, which is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the total number of cookies used by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in a bag. The total number of cookies in a bag is 36, so we subtract 27 from 36: 36 - 27 = 9.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the shirts, we need to apply a 40% discount to the original price of $30 per shirt. 

First, let's find the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (40% or 0.4).

Discount = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in the factory's daily profit, we need to calculate the difference in their daily earnings before and after switching from producing tractors to silos.

The daily earnings from producing tractors were $1000 (10 tractors * $100 per tractor). The daily earnings from producing silos are $1100 (5 silos * $220 per silo).

The difference in daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100.

Plugging in the values, we get: (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100 = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory's daily earnings have increased by 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"As a multiplication expert, I can efficiently calculate the total cost per year for Madeline's dog expenses.

First, let's determine the monthly cost of food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly food cost by 4:

Food cost per month = $25/week * 4 weeks/month
Food cost per month = $25 * 4
Food cost per month = $100

Next, we add the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the food cost:

Total cost per month = Food cost per month + Treats cost per month + Medicine cost per month
Total cost per month = $100 + $20 + $100
Total cost per month = $220

Now, to find the total cost per year, we multiply the total cost per month by 12:

Total cost per year = Total cost per month * 12
Total cost per year = $220 * 12
Total cost per year = $2,640

The final answer is: $2640"

"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the number of plant pots April has left over.

To determine the total number of plant pots needed, we must first calculate the number of pots required for the roses. Since April needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 pots for the daisies, we can calculate the number of pots needed for the roses as 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses: 30 + 60 = 90.

To find the number of plant pots April has left over, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number she already bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

"When it comes to solving word problems involving subtraction, I always start by identifying the key elements: the initial amount, the amount spent, and the amount given away. In this case, Andrea starts with $36, spends $11 on a sweater, and gives her brother $4.

To find the amount Andrea saved, I'll subtract the total amount spent and given away from the initial amount. The total amount spent and given away is $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to brother) = $15.

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

Initial amount: $36
Amount spent and given away: $15

Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount spent and given away
Amount saved = $36 - $15
Amount saved = $21

However, the question asks for the amount Andrea saved, not the amount she had left after saving. To find the amount saved, we need to subtract the amount spent and given away from the initial amount, not the amount left after saving.

Amount saved = Initial amount - (Amount spent + Amount given away)
Amount saved = $36 - ($11 + $4)
Amount saved = $36 - $15
Amount saved = $21

"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total time he spent on all activities and then find 40% of that total.

First, let's calculate the time spent on boating and swimming. Since he spent half the time swimming as he did boating, we can express this as:

Boating time = 6 hours
Swimming time = 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Next, we'll calculate the time spent watching shows. Since there were 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, we can express this as:

Show time = 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours

Now, we can find the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows = Boating time + Swimming time + Show time
= 6 + 3 + 6
= 15 hours

We are given that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. We can express this as an equation:

0.30 * Total time = 6 hours

To find the total time, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.30:

Total time = 6 / 0.30
Total time = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * Total time
= 0.40 * 20
= 8 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:
$10/hour × 20 hours = $200

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from the second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:
$5/hour × 15 hours = $75

Now, we'll add her earnings from both jobs to find her total earnings:
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we'll subtract this amount from the cost of the phone to determine how much more she needs to save:
$400 - $80 = $320 (remaining amount needed)
$320 - $275 = $45

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45 to buy the phone.

"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we need to establish the relationship between the heights of the three trees. 

Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as S, the height of the second tree as S + 5, and the height of the tallest tree as T. We are given that the shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, so S = 6.

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, which is S + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, we need to find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the height of the two trees combined. The combined height of the two shorter trees is S + (S + 5) = 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, so T = 2 * (S + (S + 5)) = 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$25 / $35 = 0.71

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.71 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $25 - $5 = $20. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$20 / $35 = 0.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.57 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $20 - $5 = $15. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$15 / $35 = 0.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.43 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $15 - $20 = -5. 

Since the remaining budget is negative, we can't invite any friends.

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $15 - $5 = $10. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$10 / $35 = 0.29

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.14 ≈ 0

"As a subtraction and multiplication expert, I can confidently calculate the total savings for Marisa.

First, let's determine the daily savings by subtracting the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Cost of lollipops: 4 x $0.25 = $1

Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, to find the total savings over 5 days, I'll multiply the daily savings by the number of days.

Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Given the scenario, we need to determine the amount of candy Billy bought. To do this, we'll work backwards from the information provided.

First, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05. We can find the total number of gumballs he bought by dividing the total cost by the cost per gumball:

$$\frac{2}{0.05} = 40$$

Since we know he bought 40 gumballs, we can find the amount of money he had left after buying the candy. He took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs, so the amount he spent on gumballs is half of his change. Let's call the amount of money he had left after buying the candy 'x'. Then, the amount he spent on gumballs is $\frac{x}{2}$.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{x}{2} = 2$$

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

$$x = 4$$

This means that Billy had $4 left after buying the candy. Since he started with $10, the amount he spent on candy is:

$$10 - 4 = 6$$

Now, we can find the amount of candy he bought by dividing the total cost by the cost per pound:

$$\frac{6}{1.5} = 4$$

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve for the son's age, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the son's age. This can be expressed as:

2x - 5 = 45

To isolate 'x', we need to add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

(2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the son's age is 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the train and then divide it by the distance required for service.

First, let's find the total distance traveled in one trip. The train travels from the first city to the second city, which is 75 miles, then from the second city to the third city, which is 100 miles, and finally from the third city to the first city, which is 125 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two segments).

Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:

Total distance in a day = 3 × 300 miles = 900 miles

Now, we need to find the number of days between services. The train requires service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day:

Number of days between services = Total distance between services ÷ Total distance in a day
= 18,000 miles ÷ 900 miles
= 20 days

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount of stuffing needed for Mark's custom dog beds, we need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for each type of bed and then sum the total amount needed.

First, let's find the average amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The average is calculated by adding the stuffing amounts for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, then dividing by 2.

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

To find the total amount of stuffing needed, we add the stuffing required for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total time taken for a round trip, which requires us to consider both the distance and speed for each leg of the journey. 

First, let's calculate the time taken to drive to the friend's house. The distance to the friend's house is 200 miles, and the speed is 70 mph. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we get:

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, we must also account for the detour that added 10 miles to the trip. This means the actual distance traveled to the friend's house is 210 miles. Therefore, the correct time taken to drive to the friend's house is:

Time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Next, we need to calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph. Using the same formula, we get:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, to find the total time taken for the trip, we add the time taken to drive to the friend's house and the time taken to drive back home:

Total Time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"As a subtraction expert, I'll break down the problem step by step to find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

First, let's identify the total number of students and the number of absent students.

Total number of fourth-graders = 96
Number of absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Now, let's find the number of students present by subtracting the number of absent students from the total number of fourth-graders.

Number of students present = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

Next, we need to find the number of girls present by subtracting the number of absent girls from the total number of girls.

Number of girls present = Total number of girls - Number of absent girls
= 43 - 5
= 38

Finally, we can find the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls present from the number of students present.

Number of boys present = Number of students present - Number of girls present
= 87 - 38
= 49

The final answer is: 49"

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of boys to the number of girls.

6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18.

"As a subtraction expert, I can confidently calculate the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass. 

To find the minimum points required, we need to subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Total required points = 42
Points scored in the first test = 15
Points scored in the second test = 18

Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

Points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far
= 42 - 33
= 9

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Given the scenario, we have a system of linear equations representing the number of customers kicked out of the Walmart for different reasons. Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given the following information:

1. M = 3 (customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks)
2. S = 4M - 5 (customers kicked out for shoplifting)
3. V = 3S (customers kicked out for physical violence)
4. M + S + V + O = 50 (total number of customers kicked out)

We can substitute the expressions for S and V into the fourth equation:

M + (4M - 5) + 3(4M - 5) + O = 50

Combine like terms:

M + 4M - 5 + 12M - 15 + O = 50

Combine like terms:

17M - 20 + O = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17M + O = 70

Subtract 17M from both sides:

O = 70 - 17M

Since M = 3, substitute M into the equation:

O = 70 - 17(3)
O = 70 - 51
O = 19

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote Erin's initial points as x. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. This can be represented as:

x + 14 = 3(8)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into categories and calculate each component separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and we have 44 seniors. The total cost of the picture frames is:

44 \* $20 = $880

Next, we need to consider the etching cost, which is an additional 20% of the frame cost. To find the etching cost per frame, we multiply the frame cost by 0.20:

$20 \* 0.20 = $4

Now, we multiply the etching cost per frame by the total number of frames:

$4 \* 44 = $176

The total cost of the picture frames and etching is the sum of these two amounts:

$880 + $176 = $1056

In addition to the picture frames and etching, we also need to account for the cost of pins for 2 seniors and cords for 1/4 of the seniors. Since 1/4 of 44 is 11, we have 11 seniors who will receive cords.

The cost of the pins is:

2 \* $5 = $10

The cost of the cords is:

11 \* $12 = $132

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the gifts by adding the costs of the picture frames and etching, the pins, and the cords:

$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The final answer is: $1198"
"When it comes to calculating the cost savings of a DIY project, I always start by identifying the original cost and the percentage of savings. In this case, the original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400, and the DIY version saves 20% of that cost.

To calculate the materials cost, I'll first find 20% of $400. This can be done by multiplying $400 by 0.20, which is the decimal equivalent of 20%. 

$400 * 0.20 = $80

Now, I'll subtract the cost savings from the original cost to find the materials cost.

$400 - $80 = $320

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

Let's start with the number of shoes sold on Friday: 14 pairs. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold on Friday is 14 * 2 = 28.

On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold on Saturday is 28 * 2 = 56.

On Sunday, the store sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 * 2 = 28.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. The number of shoes returned is 12, so we subtract 12 from 28: 28 - 12 = 16.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 28 (Friday) + 56 (Saturday) + 16 (Sunday) = 100.

"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent is $400,000. 
The value of the faulty pieces is 40% of $400,000. To find 40% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.4 (since 40% is equivalent to 0.4 as a decimal).

$400,000 * 0.4 = $160,000

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent:

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we need to perform two operations: subtraction and multiplication.

First, we need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. Since Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls, and she fed 6 children, we can calculate the remaining rolls as follows:

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (rolls fed to children) = 6 (remaining rolls)

Now, we need to break each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. To do this, we multiply the number of remaining rolls by 8:

6 (remaining rolls) × 8 (pieces per roll) = 48 (pieces of rolls)

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to calculate the proportions of pupils who like blue, green, and yellow.

First, we find the proportion of pupils who like blue, which is 50% of the total class. This can be represented as 0.5 * 40 = 20 pupils.

Next, we calculate the proportion of pupils who like green, which is 25% of the remaining pupils. The remaining pupils are 100% - 50% = 50% of the total class, or 0.5 * 40 = 20 pupils. One-fourth of 20 is 20 * 0.25 = 5 pupils.

The total number of pupils who like blue and green is 20 + 5 = 25 pupils.

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils: 40 - 25 = 15 pupils.

We are also given that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. 

Now, we need to find out how many apples she picked on Wednesday. We know that on Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is Tuesday. So, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is 2 * 12 = 24.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the number of socks Lindsay has missed.

To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of socks from the pairs and the loose socks. 

10 pairs of socks is equal to 10 x 2 = 20 socks. 
Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, we subtract the number of socks Lindsay has washed from the total number of socks. 
50 - 35 = 15

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."

65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten by brother) = 21

Therefore, the correct answer is 21."
"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to determine the total interest and then divide it by the number of months. The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.

Given:
P = $3,650
r = 10% or 0.10
t = 5 months or 5/12 years

First, we need to convert the time from months to years: 5/12 years.

Now, we can calculate the total interest:
I = P * r * t
I = $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12)
I = $3,650 * 0.10 * 0.4167
I = $152.08

The total amount to be paid is the principal + interest:
Total Amount = P + I
Total Amount = $3,650 + $152.08
Total Amount = $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $3,802.08 / 5
Monthly Payment = $760.416

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the monthly payment is $760.

The final answer is: $760"
"To determine the distance Cho hiked, we apply the fundamental principle of multiplication: the product of the speed and time. Given Cho's speed of 14 kilometers per hour and a duration of 8 hours, we calculate the distance as 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km.

Next, we calculate Chloe's distance by multiplying her speed of 9 kilometers per hour by the time of 5 hours: 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km.

To find the difference in distance between Cho and Chloe, we apply the operation of subtraction: 112 km - 45 km = 67 km.

The final answer is: 67"
"To calculate the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to add their silver and gold pesos separately and then sum the results.

Let's start with the silver pesos. Axel has 50 silver pesos, and Anna has twice as many, which is 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos. Axel has 80 gold pesos, and Anna has 40 more than Axel, which is 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos. The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos to find the overall total. 150 (silver pesos) + 200 (gold pesos) = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To determine the profit per hour Millie makes from her lemonade stand, we need to calculate the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she operates the stand.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Since Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1 and she can make 36 cups in total, the total revenue is 36 \* $1 = $36.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. The cost of the supplies is $18. Therefore, the total cost is $18.

Now, we can calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we need to know the number of hours Millie operates the stand. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, the number of hours she operates the stand is 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to isolate the variable x, which represents the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2. This is a fundamental property of fractions, and it allows us to simplify the equation.

Multiplying both sides by 5/2, we get:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite the right-hand side of the equation as:

x = (12.8 * 5) / 2

Now, we can perform the multiplication first:

12.8 * 5 = 64

Then, we can divide the result by 2:

x = 64 / 2
x = 32

Therefore, the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had is 32 hectares.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to find the number of girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

Next, we need to find half of the number of girls who were initially scheduled to perform. This is equivalent to 26 * 0.5 = 13 girls.

However, since the choir's 3 teachers decided to sing with them, we need to add these 3 to the number of girls who were able to perform. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate Wilson's current math grade, we need to find the average of his 5 test scores. The formula for calculating an average is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Now, we divide the sum by the number of scores to find the average:
400 ÷ 5 = 80

In mathematical notation, this can be represented as:
(65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74) / 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"The cost of an eraser is $2 and a pencil is $3. To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can use the principles of multiplication and addition.

First, we multiply the number of erasers by their cost: 6 * $2 = $12. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

Next, we multiply the number of pencils by their cost: 8 * $3 = $24. Again, this is a simple application of the distributive property.

Now, we add the costs of the erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36. This is a basic addition problem that requires combining the results of the two multiplication operations.

In this case, the total cost is $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can express this as a multiplication problem.

Let's denote the number of messages to Ms. Thompson as 66. To find the number of messages to Mr. Yu, we multiply 66 by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = 66 × (1/3)
Messages to Mr. Yu = 66 × 1/3
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"As a pricing analyst, I'll break down the cost structure of the carnival rides to determine the optimal choice for David and Dasha.

The cost of individual rides is $4 per ride, as each ride requires 2 tickets at $2 per ticket. This is a straightforward unit cost.

On the other hand, a ride bracelet offers 9 rides for $30, which translates to a unit cost of $30 / 9 rides = $3.33 per ride. This is a more cost-effective option for David.

Dasha, however, purchases individual tickets for 9 rides at $4 per ride, resulting in a total cost of 9 * $4 = $36.

To calculate the savings, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of individual tickets: $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6 by purchasing the ride bracelet instead of individual tickets.

The final answer is: $6"
"When dividing the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts, we need to ensure we're performing a precise calculation to determine the amount of ribbon available for each gift bow.

To begin, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap: 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts.

Now, we'll divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts to find the amount of ribbon available for each gift bow:

144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

This calculation is a straightforward division problem, and the result is a clear indication of the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow.

"When dealing with ratios, it's essential to understand that the total number of parts in the ratio represents the total number of items. In this case, the ratio of Betty and Sam's popsicles is 5:6, which means the total number of parts is 5 + 6 = 11.

Given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can set up an equation to find the value of one part of the ratio. Let's denote the value of one part as x. Then, the total number of popsicles can be represented as 11x = 165.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
x = 165 / 11
x = 15

Now that we know the value of one part, we can find the number of popsicles each person has by multiplying the value of x by their respective ratio parts:
Betty's popsicles = 5x = 5 * 15 = 75
Sam's popsicles = 6x = 6 * 15 = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"When evaluating the cost-effectiveness of switching from a cable subscription to streaming services, it's essential to consider the discounts associated with bundling. In this scenario, Tim is considering canceling his $60 cable package and opting for Netflix at $10 per month, along with Hulu and Disney Plus, which normally cost $10 each but offer a 20% discount for bundling.

To calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus, we need to find 20% of their combined cost. The combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20. 

20% of $20 can be calculated as 0.20 * $20 = $4.

Therefore, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To determine the savings, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"When calculating the percentage of time spent on a task, it's essential to first determine the total time spent on all tasks. In this case, we have three tasks: writing, recording, and editing.

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 / 2 = 2 hours (since half the time spent writing)
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

To find the total time spent, we add these values together: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

Now, to find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, the correct answer is 20%."
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we must first calculate the number of books in the shelving system. Since the system has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can find the total number of books by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns.

Let's denote the number of books in the shelving system as B. We can express this as:

B = 6 * 6
B = 36

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. We can express this as:

Total books = 2B + 20

Substituting the value of B, we get:

Total books = 2(36) + 20
Total books = 72 + 20
Total books = 92

Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Let's start by calculating the total number of cards Erica initially had. She made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica had before passing any out. This is the sum of the cards she made and the cards her dad brought: 20 + 30 = 50.

Next, we need to subtract the cards she passed out. She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so the total number of cards she gave away is 24 + 5 = 29.

Now, let's subtract the cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had: 50 - 29 = 21.

Finally, we need to add the cards she received from family and friends. She received 17 cards, so the total number of cards she has now is 21 + 17 = 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"To determine the number of slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given away and then subtract that from the initial number of slices.

First, let's find the number of slices given to Bill and Mark. To do this, we'll add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4. To add fractions, we need a common denominator, which in this case is 12. 

We can rewrite 1/3 as (4/12) and 1/4 as (3/12). Now we can add them: (4/12) + (3/12) = (7/12).

Since (7/12) of the pizza was given away, we can multiply this fraction by the total number of slices to find the number of slices given away: (7/12) * 12 = 7.

Jenny also ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices given away and eaten is 7 + 2 = 9.

Now, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices given away and eaten from the initial number of slices: 12 - 9 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"As a division expert, I can confidently calculate the number of days Mark needs to save his money to buy the bike.

To determine the number of days, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount Mark earns per day. This is a straightforward division problem, where we divide the dividend (cost of the bike) by the divisor (amount earned per day).

Cost of the bike: $300
Amount earned per day: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike ÷ Amount earned per day
= $300 ÷ $10
= 30

Therefore, Mark needs to save his money for 30 days to afford the bike."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, we'll calculate the number of millipedes, which is 1/3rd of the number of spiders. To do this, we'll divide the number of spiders by 3.

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 90 ÷ 3 = 30

Next, we'll calculate the number of stink bugs, which is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.

Number of stink bugs: 2 × 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we'll add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs.

Total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

Therefore, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"Given the problem, we can represent the ages of Alice, Beth, and Erica as variables. Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A. We are given the following relationships:

1. A = B + 7 (Alice is 7 years older than Beth)
2. B = E + 5 (Beth is 5 years older than Erica)
3. E = 30 (Erica is 30 years old)

We can substitute the value of E into the second equation to find B:
B = 30 + 5
B = 35

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the first equation to find A:
A = 35 + 7
A = 42

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is A - E:
A - E = 42 - 30
A - E = 12

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"

"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find the total number of days he works in a year. Since he works 4 weeks every month and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks. Given that he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's calculate his daily earnings. He gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, his daily earnings are $50.

To find his total earnings in a year, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a year: $50 * 288.

$50 * 288 = $14400

The final answer is: $14400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. To find the total amount of flour and milk required, we multiply the amount of each ingredient by 4.

Total flour required = 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Total milk required = 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we can find the number of bags Mark needs to buy by dividing the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag.

Number of bags of flour = 12 cups ÷ 2 cups/bag = 6 bags

Similarly, since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we can find the number of bottles Mark needs to buy by dividing the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle.

Number of bottles of milk = 4 cups ÷ 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk.

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk
= 6 - 2

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's convert the power rating of the air conditioner from watts to kilowatts. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts (W), the power rating of the air conditioner is 900 W / 1000 = 0.9 kW.

The original energy used per day is the product of the power rating and the number of hours the air conditioner is used: 0.9 kW * 8 h = 7.2 kWh.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy used per day is 0.9 kW * 3 h = 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original energy used and the new energy used: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

The final numerical answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

First, let's calculate the total number of stripes. We have two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then, we have one zebra with 36 stripes. Lastly, we have another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.

Next, we need to find the total number of zebras. We have two zebras with 17 stripes each, one zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with 18 stripes. So, the total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Now, we can find the average number of stripes by dividing the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required and then multiply it by their respective costs.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs 5 pounds of each.

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00. The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

The total cost is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, the total amount Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people is $50.00."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the initial number of corns as C and the initial number of cannolis as N. We know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis, so we can write the equation:

C = 2N

We are also given that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis initially, so we can write another equation:

N = 40

Now, we can substitute the value of N into the first equation to find the initial number of corns:

C = 2(40)
C = 80

Next, we are told that Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. This means he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

The total number of corns and cannolis after the purchase is the sum of the initial number of corns and cannolis and the number of corns and cannolis bought:

Total corns = 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis = 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog. We know that he wanted to walk 10,000 steps in total. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. However, a more direct approach is to subtract the steps completed before the jog from the total steps and then subtract the remaining steps from that result.

Let's calculate the steps taken during the jog directly: 10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete. Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"As a reading time and travel time expert, I can calculate the time Toby will arrive at the airport and determine how early he will be.

To find the time Toby will arrive at the airport, we need to consider both the time it takes to read the book and the time it takes to travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to read the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words. Given Toby's reading rate of 300 words per minute, the time it takes to read the book is 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it takes to travel to the airport, which is 10 minutes.

So, the total time Toby will arrive at the airport is 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can calculate how early he will be by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's determine the total amount paid to the employees in May. The company hired 40 employees, each working 40 hours a week for 4 weeks. This results in a total of 40 employees * 160 hours/employee = 6400 hours worked in May. With each employee earning $15 per hour, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 6400 hours * $15/hour = $96,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount paid to the employees in June. Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 30 employees * 160 hours/employee = 4800 hours worked in June. With each employee earning $15 per hour, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 4800 hours * $15/hour = $72,000.

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we add the amounts paid in May and June: $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $168,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half off, so it costs $3/2 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the magnets. Since there are 4 magnets and each one costs $0.25, the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of the taffy, the seashells, and the magnets. The total cost is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

Therefore, Sally has $3 left.

The final answer is: $3"
"To calculate the total amount spent on fireworks, we need to consider the cost of the two packages and the finale firework. The first package costs $400, and the second package is twice that amount, which is 2 * 400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is the sum of the two packages: $400 + $800 = $1200.

To apply the 20% discount, we calculate the discount amount as a percentage of the total cost: 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is the original cost minus the discount: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

To find the total amount spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks and the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume in 30 days. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights.

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can find the total number of dozens needed by dividing the total number of cookies by 12.

60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

Therefore, Shannon requires 5 dozen cookies to have a sufficient supply for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 5% or 0.05. Since there are 50,000 candles, the expected number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and can explode. The probability of a candle being more dangerous is 1% or 0.01. Therefore, the expected number of candles that are more dangerous is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500.

Now, we need to find the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and is more dangerous. Since these events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of each event occurring. The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and being more dangerous is 0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005.

To find the expected number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we multiply the expected number of candles that smell like wet dog (2,500) by the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and being more dangerous (0.0005). This gives us 2,500 * 0.0005 = 1.25.

Therefore, the expected number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 1.25."
"When calculating the total cost of discounted items, it's essential to first determine the discount amount per item. In this case, the regular price of each blouse is $20, and there's a 30% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal): 0.3 * $20 = $6.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse: $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by the number of blouses to find the total cost: 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'. We can then express the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister as follows:

Let J = number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees = 30
Let S = number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees = 15
Let A = number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees = x

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is J + S + A = 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x.

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 2J + 3S = 2(30) + 3(15) = 60 + 45 = 105.

We are given that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 150 = 500

Subtracting 150 from both sides, we get:

x = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the method of substitution or elimination to find the number of dromedaries. Let's use the elimination method.

Let C be the number of camels and D be the number of dromedaries. We are given two equations:

C + D = 180  ... (Equation 1)
2C + D = 304  ... (Equation 2)

We can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we have the value of C, we can substitute it into Equation 1 to find the value of D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days. Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:

$$\text{Distance in first 4 days} = 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}$$

Next, we need to calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.30:

$$\text{Distance in next 2 days} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}$$

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:

$$\text{Distance in second week} = 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}$$

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment to find the total distance traveled by Tom:

$$\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance in first 4 days} + \text{Distance in next 2 days} + \text{Distance in the day after} + \text{Distance in second week}$$

$$\text{Total distance} = 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km}$$

$$\text{Total distance} = 3140 \text{ km}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of ratios to determine the size of Timothy's locker. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P.

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so P = 5.

We also know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, which can be expressed as P = (1/4)Z. Substituting P = 5, we get:

5 = (1/4)Z
Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, which can be expressed as Z = (1/2)T. Substituting Z = 20, we get:

20 = (1/2)T
T = 20 * 2
T = 40

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the elevation where Stanley's comb is located, we need to calculate the difference between his initial elevation and the distance the comb fell. This is a straightforward calculation involving subtraction.

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, to find the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation.

Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"The problem at hand involves basic arithmetic operations, specifically addition and multiplication. To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks and then add it to his initial capital.

First, let's determine the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. Since it's twice as much as the first bank, we can express this as 2 * $4000. Multiplying 2 by $4000 gives us 2 × $4000 = $8000.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks. This is simply the sum of the amounts received from each bank: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply the order of operations and basic arithmetic principles. 

First, we start with the initial number of cats on the rock, which is 50. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat carried: 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining cats that ran after a mouse. To do this, we multiply 3/5 by the remaining number of cats: \frac{3}{5} * 30 = \frac{3}{5} * 30 = \frac{90}{5} = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining number of cats to find the final number of cats left on the rock: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between the cost of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J.

Given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can express this relationship as:

J = T - 6

We are also told that Cole saved a total of $6, with 1/3 of the savings coming from the jogger jeans and 2/3 from the tattered jeans. This can be represented as:

(1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6

Now, we can substitute the expression for J from the first equation into the second equation:

(1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by 3:

T - 6 + 2T = 18

Combine like terms:

3T - 6 = 18

Add 6 to both sides:

3T = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

T = 8

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans:

J = T - 6
= 8 - 6
= 2

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"The capacity of the vehicles is a straightforward calculation involving multiplication and addition. To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses: 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 × 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses: 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 × 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we calculate the capacity of the minivans: 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 × 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"As an expert in multi-step arithmetic, I'll break down the problem into manageable parts to calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day.

First, let's determine the number of birds attracted to the homemade bird feeders. Since each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, and each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, we can express the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders as 20 + 10 = 30 birds per feeder.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders. Lillian made 3 homemade bird feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Next, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, and Lillian bought 3 of them. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is $4. To find 25% of $4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 4 × 0.25 = $1. Then, we add this amount to the cost of the bagel: 4 + 1 = $5.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cake. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 ÷ 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as x.

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, he sold 2/3 of the cards. We know that he sold 33.33 cards, but since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards. This means 2/3 of x = 33.

To find x, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x = 33

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate x:

x = 33 * (3/2)

x = 33 * 3 / 2

x = 99 / 2

x = 49.5

However, since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also consider that the 33 cards sold is actually 2/3 of the total, so we can set up the equation as:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the initial preparation and the unexpected increase in guests. The caterer initially prepared for 36 guests, with half of them (18) to have two hotdogs and the other half (18) to have one hotdog. This means the caterer prepared a total of 18 * 2 + 18 * 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. To find out how many hotdogs were needed, we multiply the new number of guests by 2: 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, we need to find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog. To do this, we subtract the number of hotdogs prepared from the number of hotdogs needed: 80 - 54 = 26.

This means 26 hotdogs were not enough, and therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Indras has 6 letters in her name. We need to find the number of letters in her sister's name, which is 4 more than half of the letters in Indras' name.

Let's denote the number of letters in Indras' sister's name as x. We can set up the equation:

x = (1/2) * 6 + 4

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

x = 3 + 4
x = 7

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names. We can do this by adding the number of letters in each name:

Total letters = 6 + 7
Total letters = 13

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"As a seasoned expert in calculating discounts and totals, I'll break down the problem step by step to determine the final cost of Charlotte's order.

To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items before the discount. This involves adding the cost of the set of pot and pans, the set of mixing bowls, and the cost of the 5 separate utensils.

The cost of the set of pot and pans is $120.00, the set of mixing bowls is $20.00, and the 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each. Therefore, the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add the costs together:

Total cost before discount = $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00
Total cost before discount = $165.00

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20% of the total cost before discount. To find 20% of $165.00, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20:

Discount = 0.20 x $165.00
Discount = $33.00

Now that we have the discount, we can calculate the total cost after the discount by subtracting the discount from the total cost before discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00
Total cost after discount = $132.00

Therefore, the final answer is $132.00."
"To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to break down the information provided. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This can be represented as:

3/4 * 100 = 75

Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. This can be represented as:

2 * 75 = 150

Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. This can be represented as:

1/5 * 150 = 30

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount in each container by performing the division: 15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container.

Now, we need to convert the amount of gas in one container from gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equivalent to 8 pints. Therefore, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8: 3 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the amount in one container. To do this, we can multiply 3 gallons by 1/4: 3 gallons × 1/4 = 3/4 gallons. Now, we convert 3/4 gallons to pints by multiplying 3/4 by 8 pints/gallon: (3/4) × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using a system of linear equations. We can represent the situation as follows:

Let x be the number of candy bars George bought and y be the amount of money he spent on candy bars.

We know that the total amount of money George spent is $5, so we can write the equation:

y + 1.20 = 5

We also know that the cost of each candy bar is $0.75, so the amount of money George spent on candy bars is:

y = 0.75x

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

0.75x + 1.20 = 5

Subtracting 1.20 from both sides, we get:

0.75x = 3.80

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get:

x = 5.0667

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"The problem at hand involves a straightforward application of arithmetic operations. To determine the number of lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we must first subtract the number of lollipops he kept from the total, and then divide the result by the number of friends.

Let's denote the total number of lollipops as T, the number of lollipops Ray kept as K, and the number of friends as F. We are given that T = 25 and K = 5. The number of lollipops shared is T - K = 25 - 5 = 20.

Now, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends, F = 4, to find the number of lollipops each friend received: 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"The problem at hand involves dividing a cake into equal portions and then determining the weight of the remaining cake after two pieces have been consumed. 

To begin, we need to divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece. This is a straightforward division problem.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake ÷ Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces ÷ 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, we need to find the total weight of the cake consumed by Rory and her mom. Since each of them had a piece, we multiply the weight of each piece by 2.

Total weight eaten = 2 × Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 × 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"

"As a seasoned expert in culinary economics, I can help you calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup. 

To begin, we need to determine the total cost of the ingredients. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double the amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine requires 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of the ingredients by adding the cost of onions and beef stock: $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a ratio between the time it takes for Wayne and Bernadette to get to the theater. Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as W and the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater as B.

We are given that B = 4W, since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. We are also given that W = 4 minutes.

Substituting W = 4 into the equation B = 4W, we get B = 4(4) = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to find the time difference between their arrival times. Let's denote the time difference as Δt. We can express this as:

Δt = W - (B - 5)

Substituting W = 4 and B = 16 into the equation, we get:

Δt = 4 - (16 - 5)
Δt = 4 - 11
Δt = -7

However, since time cannot be negative, we need to find the time difference in terms of the time it takes for Bernadette to leave before Wayne. Let's denote the time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne as t. We can express this as:

t = B - Δt

Substituting B = 16 and Δt = -7 into the equation, we get:

t = 16 - (-7)
t = 16 + 7
t = 23

Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 23 minutes before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we must convert the length to feet, as the area is already in square feet.

Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3, which yields 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
To isolate the width, we divide both sides of the equation by 9:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ \text{width} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

With the length and width known, we can now calculate the perimeter of the room using the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"The task at hand is a simple arithmetic problem involving the comparison of quantities. To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has and then find the difference between their totals.

Let's start by calculating the total number of beads Elizabeth has. She bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can express this as:

Elizabeth's beads = (1 pack of red beads) + (2 packs of clear beads)
= 1 × 20 + 2 × 20
= 20 + 40
= 60

Next, we'll calculate the total number of beads Margareth has. She bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Again, each pack contains 20 pieces of beads:

Margareth's beads = (3 packs of blue beads) + (4 packs of red beads)
= 3 × 20 + 4 × 20
= 60 + 80
= 140

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of beads Margareth and Elizabeth have:

Difference = Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it is on for 3 hours. We can represent this as a rate of change, which is the change in temperature per unit of time. In this case, the rate of change is 5 degrees per hour. The time the oven is on is 3 hours, so we multiply the rate of change by the time to get the total temperature increase:

ΔT_oven = rate × time = 5°/h × 3 h = 15°

Next, we need to calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to convert this to hours to match the units with the oven's rate of change. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. The rate of cooling is 2 degrees every 10 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.2 degrees per minute. We can convert this to degrees per hour by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

rate_cooling = 2° / 10 min × (1 h / 60 min) = 0.2° / min × (1 h / 60 min) = 0.2° / h

Now, we can calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window:

ΔT_window = rate_cooling × time = 0.2°/h × 0.5 h = 0.1°

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. We add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the open window to get the final temperature:

T_final = T_initial + ΔT_oven - ΔT_window = 40° + 15° - 0.1° = 54.9°

The final answer is: $\boxed{54.9}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate James' total time and then subtract the time he spent on the swim and bike to find the time he spent on the run.

First, let's find James' total time. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's. Jon's total time is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes. Therefore, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Next, let's find the time James spent on the swim and bike. James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find the time James spent on the run. We can do this by subtracting the time he spent on the swim and bike from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{59}$"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we need to break down the given information step by step.

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. This gives us:

1.25 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Next, we're told that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, we're given that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

80 minutes ÷ 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

"To determine the amount of change Michael has after buying hay for his horse, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs, the amount of hay it consumes, and the total cost of the hay.

First, let's convert the time from minutes to hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we can convert 30 minutes to hours as follows:

30 minutes = 30/60 hours = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. Given that the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we have:

Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, we can calculate the total amount of hay consumed as follows:

Total hay consumed = 16 miles * (1/2 bail/mile) = 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is:

Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5 = $30

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has:

Change = Total money - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then divide that by the number of eggs per glass, and finally divide that result by the number of glasses per tray.

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = \$340 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store sale} = 31 \times 25 = \$775 \]

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Initial cost} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

The final answer is: $539"

"Let's analyze the given situation. We have two options for buying a movie ticket and snacks:

1. A super ticket for $20 that includes a movie ticket and a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. A movie ticket for $12 and a soda and popcorn at regular prices.

We are given that the soda costs $3 and that not buying the super ticket results in a savings of $2.

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \(p\). The cost of the super ticket can be expressed as the sum of the movie ticket price, the soda price, and the extra cost for the popcorn and soda: $20 = $12 + $3 + $p + $1.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$20 = $12 + $3 + $p + $1
$20 = $16 + $p
$p = $20 - $16
$p = $4

However, this contradicts the information given that the extra $1 for the super ticket is for both the popcorn and the soda. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

If we buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If we buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. Let's denote the original cost as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 × 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"As a seasoned expert in weighted averages, I can tell you that calculating the average speed of a car on a trip involves a straightforward application of the concept. When dealing with varying speeds over different time intervals, it's essential to consider the weighted average formula.

Given that the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and 30 mph for 1 hour, we can calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

To find the average speed, we use the weighted average formula:

Average Speed = (Total Distance) / (Total Time)

However, in this case, since the speeds are constant over the respective time intervals, we can also use the formula:

Average Speed = (Weighted Distance) / (Total Time)

Weighted Distance = (Distance1 x Time1) + (Distance2 x Time2)
Weighted Distance = (120 x 2) + (30 x 1)
Weighted Distance = 240 + 30
Weighted Distance = 270

Average Speed = Weighted Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 270 / 3
Average Speed = 90

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is actually the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 miles / 3 hours.

Average Speed = 150 / 3
Average Speed = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to consider the initial value of her sapphires and the value of the rubies she received in exchange.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, each worth $800. The value of her initial sapphires is 8 × $800 = $6400.

She then trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the sapphires she traded is 3 × $800 = $2400. The value of the rubies she received is 2 × $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we need to subtract the value of the sapphires she traded from the initial value of her sapphires and then add the value of the rubies she received. This can be represented as:

Total Value = Initial Value - Value Traded + Value Received
Total Value = $6400 - $2400 + $2400
Total Value = $6400

The final answer is: $6400"
"The problem at hand is a straightforward application of the multiplication principle. Given that Marin and Nancy each consume 4 apples per day, we can calculate the total number of apples they eat in 30 days by multiplying the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

To begin, we identify the number of apples Marin and Nancy eat per day: 4 apples/day. Since they eat the same amount, we can simply multiply this value by 2 to account for both individuals: 4 apples/day * 2 = 8 apples/day.

Now, we apply the multiplication principle to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the cost of potting soil for Bob's raised beds, we need to calculate the total volume of soil required and then multiply it by the cost per unit volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of one raised bed. The formula for volume is length * width * height. In this case, the dimensions are 8 feet (length), 2 feet (width), and 2 feet (height). 

Volume = length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost per bag is $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards in the set, we need to calculate the number of green cards first. Given that there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can express this as an equation:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"The problem at hand involves a sequence of additions and subtractions of fairies. Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, we have 50 fairies.

Next, 25 fairies join the group, bringing the total to 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Then, 30 fairies fly away, leaving us with 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the ratio of puppies with spots to the total number of puppies.

Let's start by finding the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the correct answer is 35%."
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the truck's capacity.

First, let's calculate the weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together to find the total weight of the feed:

Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
Total weight = 3400 pounds

Next, we'll divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"As a multiplication expert, I can efficiently calculate the total earnings for Grayson. 

To find the weekly earnings, we need to multiply the number of cans and bottles by their respective values and then add the results.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 3 × 2 = 6 cents/week
Weekly earnings from plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 5 × 3 = 15 cents/week

Now, we add the earnings from cans and bottles to get the total weekly earnings: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 6 + 15 = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to get the total earnings for the month: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 21 × 4 = 84 cents/month

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total amount Ali has now, we need to add the amount Leila gave him to the amount he already had.

Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is calculated as 100 / 2 = $50.

Ali's initial amount was $21. 

To find the total, we add these two amounts together: 21 + 50 = $71.

The final answer is: $71"
"To calculate the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to determine 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza.

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of this amount, we can multiply the cost by 1/5 or divide it by 5.

Tip = (1/5) × $15
Tip = $15 ÷ 5
Tip = $3

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine Finley's final position, we can track her movements using a simple arithmetic approach. 

Let's denote her initial position as 1. 

She fell back 5 spots, so her new position is 1 - 5 = -4. However, since we're dealing with positions, we can consider this as a relative change. To find her actual position, we add the initial position: -4 + 1 = -3. 

Then, she moved ahead 2 spots, so her new position is -3 + 2 = -1.

Next, she fell behind 3 spots, so her new position is -1 - 3 = -4.

Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race, so her final position is -4 + 1 = -3.

However, since we're dealing with positions, we need to consider the context. In a 100-meter race, positions are typically represented as positive integers. To find her actual position, we can add 100 to her final position: -3 + 100 = 97.

The final answer is: 97"
"As an expert in multi-step arithmetic, I'll break down the problem into manageable parts to find the total number of students Miss Maria has.

First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards. Since Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 6 × 25 = 150.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of baseball cards. With 5 boxes containing 40 cards each, we can represent this as another multiplication problem: 5 × 40 = 200.

Now, we need to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has. This is a simple addition problem: 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

However, Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we need to subtract this from the total number of cards: 350 - 50 = 300.

Since each student receives 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives: 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the difference in the amount Kelly paid compared to Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for each of them after applying the discounts.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each. The total cost before the discount is 20 * 45 cents = $9. Since she received a $1 discount, her final cost is $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each. The total cost before the discount is 20 * 50 cents = $10. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $10, which is 0.1 * $10 = $1. Therefore, Kelly's final cost is $10 - $1 = $9.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount Kelly paid compared to Becky. This is simply $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets: 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases: 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Total number of items per room: 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

Now, to find the total number of items for 80 rooms, we multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200

The final answer is: 1200"
"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday.

Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he acquires 5 pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he acquires 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

To find the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs, we add the initial number of shoes to the shoes acquired on each day: 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

However, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find the total number of shoes he has on Sunday, we subtract 180 from the total: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Therefore, the correct answer is 120."
"To determine the number of pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. 

Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we can find the total number of cupcakes by multiplying the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate: 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 ÷ 12 = 4

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes."
"When solving multi-step word problems involving subtraction and multiplication, it's essential to break down the problem into manageable parts and tackle each step systematically. In this case, we're dealing with a straightforward scenario where Theo purchases a pen and a piece of paper.

First, let's identify the cost of the pen, which is given as $2. The cost of the paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen. To find the cost of the paper, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Cost of paper = 3 × Cost of pen - $1
= 3 × $2 - $1
= $6 - $1
= $5

Now that we have the cost of the paper, we can calculate the total cost of both items:

Total cost = Cost of pen + Cost of paper
= $2 + $5
= $7

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, we can find the change she received by subtracting the total cost from the amount she paid:

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
= $10 - $7
= $3

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially in the class. Since there are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils, we can find the total by multiplying the number of students by the number of pencils per student.

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Next, we determine the number of pencils used after two months. We are given that 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find this, we multiply the total pencils by the fraction 1/5.

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we find the remaining pencils after two months by subtracting the pencils used from the total.

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

Finally, we need to find the number of pencils left at the end of the year. We are told that only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find this, we multiply the remaining pencils by the fraction 1/3.

Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat is 6."
"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we need to calculate the combined length of the remoras and then divide it by the length of the shark.

First, let's convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can divide the length of each remora by 12 to get its length in feet.

6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2 to get the combined length of the remoras.

Combined length of remoras = 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"When dealing with word problems involving fractions, it's essential to identify the key information and translate it into mathematical expressions. In this case, we're given that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, and 20 students do not have a desktop computer.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine how many days Jason has to walk in total in 3 weeks, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 to find out how many days he has to walk in a week.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4

"Division is a fundamental operation in mathematics that allows us to share a quantity into equal parts or groups. In this scenario, we're dealing with a straightforward division problem where we need to find out how many books each child received.

Given that Sarah spent $300 on books and each book costs $15, we can calculate the total number of books she purchased by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total number of books = Total amount spent ÷ Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 ÷ $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of children to find out how many books each child received.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books ÷ Number of children
Number of books each child got = 20 ÷ 4
Number of books each child got = 5

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we can use a Venn diagram to visualize the problem. Let's denote the set of kids allergic to dairy as D, the set of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the set of kids allergic to both as B.

We know that |D| = 9, |P| = 6, and |B| = 3. We also know that the total number of kids in the class is 32.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts as:

|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |B|
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the complement of the set of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. The total number of kids in the class is the union of the set of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts and the set of kids not allergic to anything. Therefore, we can find the number of kids not allergic to anything as:

|not allergic| = |total| - |D ∪ P|
= 32 - 12
= 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"The total number of people going on the tour can be calculated by first determining the total number of employees and then adding the number of tour guides.

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides by multiplying the number of groups by the number of tour guides per group: 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

The final answer is: 621"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since there are two people, and each ticket costs $5000, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 × $5000 = $10,000.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The normal price is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive due to the busy weekend. To find the new price, we calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.20 × $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price to get the new price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 × $1800 = $5400.

Now, we can find the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"

"As a subtraction expert, I can tell you that the problem at hand involves finding the difference between the number of additional songs Gabriel and Luri can add to their respective players.

Let's start by determining the number of songs Luri has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can express this relationship as:

Luri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 * 20
Luri's songs = 60

Now, let's find out how many more songs each can add to their player. The maximum capacity of the player is 100 songs. To find the number of additional songs each can add, we subtract the number of songs they already have from the maximum capacity:

Additional songs Gabriel can add = Maximum capacity - Gabriel's songs
Additional songs Gabriel can add = 100 - 20
Additional songs Gabriel can add = 80

Additional songs Luri can add = Maximum capacity - Luri's songs
Additional songs Luri can add = 100 - 60
Additional songs Luri can add = 40

To find the difference between the number of additional songs Gabriel and Luri can add, we subtract the number of additional songs Luri can add from the number of additional songs Gabriel can add:

Difference = Additional songs Gabriel can add - Additional songs Luri can add
Difference = 80 - 40
Difference = 40

"To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to determine the number of oranges he ate. Since they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, we can find this by multiplying 60 by 2/5.

To multiply a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number by the numerator and then divide by the denominator. In this case, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5.

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, we need to find the total amount of money he gave up. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.

24 * 10 = 240

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

First, we calculate the total miles run in a week by multiplying the miles run per day by the number of days in a week.

Total miles run in a week = miles run per day * number of days in a week
= 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 12 * 5
= 60 miles/week

Now, we divide the total miles run in a week by James' speed to find the total hours he runs in a week.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 60/10

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by his horses in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

First, we calculate the daily consumption of oats per horse. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day. Therefore, the daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily consumption of oats is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total consumption for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to determine how many 50-pound bags of oats are needed to meet this total consumption. To do this, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to first determine the total number of Pomeranians. Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can express this as a fraction:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) × 27

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the whole number (27) and keep the denominator (3) the same:

Pomeranians = (2 × 27) / 3
Pomeranians = 54 / 3
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can express this as a fraction:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) × 18

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (1) by the whole number (18) and keep the denominator (3) the same:

Girl Pomeranians = (1 × 18) / 3
Girl Pomeranians = 18 / 3
Girl Pomeranians = 6

"When analyzing the given scenario, we need to consider the buy one get one free promotion and the $2.00 coupon. 

First, let's calculate the effective cost of one pack of razors with the buy one get one free promotion. Since Heather will only pay for 1 pack, the cost remains $4.00.

However, she also has a $2.00 coupon, which reduces the cost of the pack to $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon: 2 packs * $2.00 = $4.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $4.00 / 8 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote Angela's current age as A and Brett's current age as B. We know that Brett is 14 years old, so B = 14.

The problem states that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This can be represented by the equation:

A + 4 = 3(B)

Substituting B = 14 into the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 3(14)

Expanding the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

A = 38

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total cost of Paul's daily car rides over a period of 14 days. To approach this, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then sum them up.

The cost of the morning rides can be calculated as follows:

Morning rides cost = 14 days * $6 per day
= 14 × 6
= 84

The cost of the afternoon rides can be calculated as follows:

Afternoon rides cost = 14 days * $2 per day

= 112

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $112."
"To determine the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges required for one pie.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ashley brought. She has 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so we can express this as 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Since she brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, we can express this as 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, we can find the total number of oranges they have by adding Ashley's and Brianne's oranges: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

To find out how many pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie, which is 3. This can be expressed as 120 ÷ 3 = 40 pies.

Therefore, the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make is 40.

"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x. The cost of the second venue is a per-person charge of $25, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 yields:

x = 10

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of insects Lily found as L, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Bodhi found as B.

We are given that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write the equation: L = D + 7.

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write the equation: D = B/2.

Lastly, we know that together they collected 43 insects, so we can write the equation: L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into the new equation: 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations. Let's denote the width of the chair as C, the width of the rug as R, and the length of the couch as L.

We are given that the chair is 3 feet wide, so C = 3.

The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so R = C + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so L = 2 * R + 2 = 2 * 8 + 2 = 18 feet.

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"Let's analyze the problem. We have a system of equations representing the total cost of the gum packs. We can denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x' and the cost of the green apple pack as 'y'. We know that the cost of the grape pack is $2.

We have the following information:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost is $7.

We can set up the following system of equations:

1) 2x + y + 2 + 1 = 7 (total cost equation)
2) x + x + y + 1 = 7 (total number of packs equation)

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
2x + y + 3 = 7

Subtracting 3 from both sides:
2x + y = 4

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
2x + y = 7

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
2x + y = 4
2x + y = 7

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
0 = 3

This is a contradiction, which means that the system of equations has no solution. However, we can try to find a solution by analyzing the problem. Let's re-examine the second equation: x + x + y + 1 = 7. We can simplify it to 2x + y = 6.

Now we have a system of two equations:
2x + y = 4
2x + y = 6

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
0 = 2

This is still a contradiction. However, we can try to find a solution by analyzing the problem. Let's re-examine the information given. We know that the total cost is $7, and the cost of the grape pack is $2. We also know that the cost of the green apple pack is half as much as the grape pack, which is $1.

We can set up the following equation:
2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + 3 = 7

Subtracting 3 from both sides:
2x = 4

Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To optimize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the most cost-effective combination of 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood within his budget of $24.

Let's define the decision variables:

- x: number of 2 x 4 pieces of wood
- y: number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood

The objective function to maximize is the total number of popsicle sticks, which is given by:

Maximize: 200x + 400y

The constraints are:

1. Budget constraint: 4x + 6y ≤ 24 (since each 2 x 4 costs $4 and each 2 x 8 costs $6)
2. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (since we cannot buy a negative number of pieces of wood)

To solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method or simplex method. However, in this case, we can also solve it by inspection.

Since 2 x 8 pieces of wood give more sticks per dollar, we want to maximize the number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood. Let's first find the maximum number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy:

4x + 6y ≤ 24
6y ≤ 24
y ≤ 4

So, the maximum number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy is 4.

Now, let's find the remaining budget after buying 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood:

4x + 6(4) ≤ 24
4x ≤ 24 - 24
4x ≤ 0
x ≤ 0

Since x cannot be negative, we set x = 0.

Now, we have the optimal solution: x = 0, y = 4.

The total number of popsicle sticks is:

200(0) + 400(4) = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"As a multiplication expert, I can tell you that the problem at hand is a straightforward application of the multiplication operation. To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog and then multiply the result by the cost per pair of snowshoes.

First, we multiply the number of dogs (6) by the number of legs per dog (4):

6 × 4 = 24

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes needed:

24 ÷ 2 = 12

Now, we multiply the number of snowshoes needed by the cost per pair ($12.00):

12 × $12.00 = $144.00

Therefore, the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs is $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"As a multiplication expert, I can quickly calculate the total weekly cost of Janet's bus trips. 

The cost of one bus trip is $2.20, and she takes 5 trips in a week. To find the total weekly cost, I'll multiply the cost of one trip by the number of trips.

$2.20 × 5 = $11.00

Now, let's calculate the amount Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. To do this, I'll subtract the weekly bus pass cost from the total weekly cost of bus trips.

$20 - $11.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Janet would save $9.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Given the scenario, we have two key pieces of information regarding the number of animals at the farm and the zoo. Let's denote the number of cows at the farm as F_cows and the number of sheep at the zoo as Z_sheep.

From the problem statement, we know that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so we can express this as:

F_cows = Z_cows / 2

We are also given that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, which can be written as:

F_sheep = Z_sheep / 2

However, we are given specific numbers for the number of cows at the farm (30) and the number of sheep at the zoo (20). We can use these to find the number of cows at the zoo:

Z_cows = 2 * F_cows
Z_cows = 2 * 30
Z_cows = 60

Now, we can find the number of sheep at the farm:

F_sheep = Z_sheep / 2
F_sheep = 20 / 2
F_sheep = 10

To find the total number of animals at the farm, we add the number of cows and sheep:

F_total = F_cows + F_sheep
F_total = 30 + 10
F_total = 40

To find the total number of animals at the zoo, we add the number of cows and sheep:

Z_total = Z_cows + Z_sheep
Z_total = 60 + 20
Z_total = 80

Now, we can find the total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo:

Total = F_total + Z_total
Total = 40 + 80
Total = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a ratio between the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought and the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the following ratio:
x : y = 1 : 4

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion using the ratio:
x / 12 = 1 / 4
y / 4 = 4 / 4

Simplifying the proportion, we get:
x = 3
y = 1

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to reach his weight loss goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn. Since it takes approximately 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, and Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, the total calories needed for weight loss is:

3500 calories/lb * 30 lbs = 105,000 calories

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Now, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit by dividing the total calories needed by the number of days:

105,000 calories / 171 days ≈ 613.5 calories/day

To maintain a calorie deficit, Andy needs to consume fewer calories than he burns. This can be achieved by either reducing his daily caloric intake or increasing his physical activity to burn more calories. A safe and sustainable rate of weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week, which translates to a daily calorie deficit of 500-1000 calories. However, to reach his goal in the given timeframe, Andy will need to maintain a higher calorie deficit.

The final answer is: $\boxed{614}$"
"As a multiplication expert, I can confidently calculate Gerald's weekly earnings. To find his total earnings for the week, I'll multiply his daily wage by the number of days worked.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

$30/day × 7 days = $210

Now, to determine how much Gerald has left after spending $100, I'll perform a simple subtraction:

$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Given that each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we can use the formula:

Total Distance (km) = Number of Laps * Distance per Lap
Total Distance (km) = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap
Total Distance (km) = 2 km

Now, we need to convert the total distance from kilometers to milliliters, considering that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer. To do this, we can use the conversion factor 1 km = 1000 m, and since 1 m = 1000 mm, we can also say 1 km = 1,000,000 mm or 1,000,000 μm or 1,000,000,000 μl. However, since we are working with milliliters, we can use the conversion factor 1 km = 1000,000 ml.

Total Water (ml) = Total Distance (km) * Water per km
Total Water (ml) = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total Water (ml) = 120 ml

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply $500 by 0.20:

$500 × 0.20 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:

$500 - $100 = $400

Next, we calculate the amount spent on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.25:

$400 × 0.25 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:

$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Given the problem, we can model it as a linear equation. Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000."
"The art of calculating profit is a fundamental concept in arithmetic, and I'm delighted to apply my expertise in multiplication, subtraction, and addition to this problem.

To determine the profit, we must first calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the product of the number of packs, the number of bags per pack, and the cost per bag. In this case, it's 8 packs * 5 bags/pack * $4/bag = $160.

The total revenue is the product of the number of bags and the selling price per bag, which is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

Therefore, the profit earned on the bags is $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of punches thrown by Joe during a 5-round fight, with each round lasting 3 minutes. To approach this, we need to calculate the total duration of the fight and then multiply it by the average number of punches thrown per minute.

The total duration of the fight is the product of the number of rounds and the duration of each round: 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of punches thrown by multiplying the total duration by the average number of punches per minute: 15 minutes * 25 punches/minute = 375 punches.

Therefore, the total number of punches thrown by Joe is 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. We're given that Suzanne made 36 cookies, and Josh made one-fourth of that amount. To find Josh's total, we can express this relationship as a fraction: 1/4 * 36. 

To calculate this, we multiply the numerator (1) by 36 and then divide by the denominator (4). This can be expressed as:

(1/4) * 36 = (1 * 36) / 4 = 36/4 = 9

So, Josh made 9 cookies. Now, we're told that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This can be expressed as 2 * 9.

2 * 9 = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has:
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 \* $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 \* $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = \frac{1}{2} \* $160 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   3/5 of the remaining money = \frac{3}{5} \* $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we can express this as 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, let's denote the time it takes Rob to shingle a house as R. We are given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. This can be expressed as an equation: Royce's time = 2R + 40.

We know that Rob takes 120 minutes, so we can substitute R = 120 into the equation: Royce's time = 2(120) + 40.

Simplifying the equation, we get: Royce's time = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we must first calculate the total for each item and then add them together.

For hats, we have 3 children, and each hat requires 2 skeins of wool. Therefore, the total number of skeins needed for hats is 3 * 2 = 6.

For scarves, we have 3 children, and each scarf requires 4 skeins of wool. Therefore, the total number of skeins needed for scarves is 3 * 4 = 12.

For sweaters, we have 3 children, and each sweater requires 12 skeins of wool. Therefore, the total number of skeins needed for sweaters is 3 * 12 = 36.

For mittens, we have 3 children, and each pair of mittens requires 1 skein of wool. Therefore, the total number of skeins needed for mittens is 3 * 1 = 3.

For socks, we have 3 children, and each pair of socks requires 2 skeins of wool. Therefore, the total number of skeins needed for socks is 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, let's add the total number of skeins needed for each item:
6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Tuesday. Since he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, we can express this as 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

Now, we need to find the total number of problems completed by Tuesday. This is the sum of the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday, which is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

Next, we need to calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Wednesday. He completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

To find the number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the total number of problems completed by Wednesday from the total number of problems: 100 - 61 = 39.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

The final answer is: 39"
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the rates at which each individual can pick strawberries and then sum their individual rates to find the total rate at which they can pick strawberries per hour.

Let's start by identifying the rates at which each person can pick strawberries per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby can pick 1 less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
- Ricky can pick 2 fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we can sum the individual rates to find the total rate at which they can pick strawberries per hour:

Total rate = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
Total rate = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8
Total rate = 29

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"The art of arithmetic operations - my specialty. When it comes to calculating the number of loaves of bread left, I apply the principles of basic arithmetic to arrive at the correct solution.

To find the number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked.

Let's break it down:

Initial number of loaves baked = 200
Number of loaves sold in the morning = 93
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon = 39
Number of loaves returned = 6

First, we calculate the total number of loaves sold:
93 + 39 = 132

Now, we subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked:
200 - 132 - 6 = 62

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To determine the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the number of red and blue tulips he can fit in a row. 

The number of red tulips per row is 6, and the number of blue tulips per row is 8. To find the GCF, we can list the factors of each number:

Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6
Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8

The greatest common factor of 6 and 8 is 2. 

Now, we can divide the total number of red and blue tulips by the GCF to find the number of rows of each color.

Number of red tulips = 36
GCF = 2
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 2 = 18

Number of blue tulips = 24
GCF = 2
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 2 = 12

However, we can further optimize the number of rows by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of tulips per row for each color. The LCM of 6 and 8 is 24.

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 24
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 24 = 1.5 (round up to 2, since we can't have a fraction of a row)

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 24
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 24 = 1

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 2 rows of red tulips and 1 row of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 2 + 1 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 ÷ 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 ÷ (3/4) = 18 × (4/3) = 18 × 4 ÷ 3 = 72 ÷ 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly energy consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's calculate the daily and weekly energy consumption before adding the device:

Daily energy consumption before adding the device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Weekly energy consumption before adding the device: 12 kWh/day * 7 days = 84 kWh

Next, we'll calculate the daily and weekly energy consumption after adding the device:

Daily energy consumption after adding the device: 12 kWh/day + 2 kWh/day = 14 kWh/day
Weekly energy consumption after adding the device: 14 kWh/day * 7 days = 98 kWh

Now, we'll calculate the cost of the energy consumption before and after adding the device, given that the cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50:

Cost before adding the device: 84 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $126
Cost after adding the device: 98 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $147

The difference in weekly electric bill is the cost after adding the device minus the cost before adding the device:

Difference in weekly electric bill: $147 - $126 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to consider the rate at which one person paints a house. 

Let's denote the rate at which one person paints a house as R. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can express this as:

R = 0.5 house / 5 days

To find the rate at which 5 people paint a house, we multiply the rate of one person by 5:

5R = 5 * (0.5 house / 5 days) = 0.5 house / 1 day

Now, we want to find the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days. To convert this to hours, we multiply by 24:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's analyze the problem using a system of linear equations. We can represent the number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have as variables O and J, respectively, and the number of chairs as C and D, respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: O = C - 2
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: D = 3C
3. Ophelia has 20 sofas: O = 20
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: J = D - 2

Substituting the value of O from equation 3 into equation 1, we get:
20 = C - 2
C = 22

Now, substitute the value of C into equation 2 to find the number of chairs Jenna has:
D = 3(22)
D = 66

Substitute the value of C into equation 4 to find the number of sofas Jenna has:
J = 66 - 2
J = 64

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as H and the number of CDs Tom could have bought with that money as x.

We know that the total money Tom spent is $48, and he spent $4 on the CD. Therefore, the money he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 4x = 44, where x is the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Solving for x, we get x = 44/4 = 11.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 4y = 48, where y is the total number of CDs Tom could have bought.

Solving for y, we get y = 48/4 = 12.

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we subtract the number of CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set from the total number of CDs he could have bought: 12 - 11 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to consider the varying hours he spent each week. 

Let's break it down:

- For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (8 - 2 = 6). 
- For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
- For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.

We can calculate the total hours as follows:

Total hours = (6 weeks * 4 hours/week) + (2 weeks * 5 hours/week) + (1 week * 6 hours/week)
Total hours = 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours
Total hours = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by analyzing the given information.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. This means 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:
48 - 8 + 40 = 80

Now, let's move on to the second stop. At this stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving us with:
80 - 21 = 59

Next, we need to determine the number of passengers who get on at the second stop. It's stated that 3 times fewer passengers get on than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, we need to find 3 times 21, which is 63. However, this is the number of passengers who didn't get on, so we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off to find the number who got on. But since we are looking for the number of passengers who got on, we need to subtract 63 from 21, which is 21 - 63 = -42. Since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using a system of linear equations. We are given the following information:

Let J be Jame's current age and C be his cousin's current age.

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is J = 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be represented by the equation: C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5.

We can simplify the second equation to get:
C + 8 = 2J + 16 - 5
C + 8 = 2J + 11

Now, we can rewrite the equation in terms of C:
C = 2J + 11 - 8
C = 2J + 3

We are asked to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age, which is J - C.

Substituting the expression for C from the second equation into the difference equation, we get:
J - C = J - (2J + 3)
J - C = -J - 3

Now, substitute J = 22 into the equation:
J - C = -22 - 3
J - C = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
|J - C| = |-25|

"Given the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of the printer as P, and the cost of one monitor as M.

We are given the following information:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400: C + 2M + P = 2400
2. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer: P = C - 400
3. The cost of the computer is $1,100: C = 1100

We can substitute the value of C into the second equation to find the cost of the printer:
P = C - 400
P = 1100 - 400
P = 700

Now, we can substitute the values of C and P into the first equation to find the cost of one monitor:
C + 2M + P = 2400
1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400
Combine like terms:
1800 + 2M = 2400
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
2M = 600
Divide both sides by 2:
M = 300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know that the boys brought 60 seashells each, and there are 10 boys. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Next, we are told that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60. To calculate this, we first multiply 4 and 60, which gives us 240. Then, we add 60 to this result, yielding 300.

Now, we know that the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 600 (the number brought by the boys) + 300 (the additional amount brought by the girls), which equals 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we can find the number of seashells brought by each girl by dividing the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 900 / 10 = 90.

Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the initial number of candies George had as x. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had initially is 2x.

We are given that George ate 5 candies and now has 3 candies left. This can be represented by the equation x - 5 = 3.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation by adding 5 to both sides:

x - 5 + 5 = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had initially by multiplying 2x:

2x = 2(8)
2x = 16

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"As a subtraction and addition expert, I can confidently solve this problem. To find Anne's age, we need to determine Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we can express this as a simple subtraction operation.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can express this as an addition operation.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving the addition of four numbers. To solve it, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month.

To find the number of vlogs Emma should make, we need to subtract the total number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs Emma aims to make: 72
Vlogs made in the first week: 18
Vlogs made in the second week: 21
Vlogs made in the third week: 15

First, let's add the vlogs made in the first three weeks:
18 + 21 = 39
39 + 15 = 54

Now, subtract the total vlogs made from the total vlogs Emma aims to make:
72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To calculate the total amount you paid, I'll first determine the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Then, I'll add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount you paid.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

Therefore, the total amount you paid is $60."
"To solve this multi-step arithmetic word problem, let's break it down into manageable parts.

First, we need to determine the initial share of the eldest boy. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can calculate his initial share as follows:

$$\frac{18}{3} = 6$$

So, the eldest boy's initial share is $6.

Next, he adds $5 to his share, resulting in:

$$6 + 5 = 11$$

Then, he adds another $10 to his share, giving him a total of:

$$11 + 10 = 21$$

However, he later spends $8 from his total, leaving him with:

$$21 - 8 = 13$$

Finally, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8, resulting in:

$$13 \times 3 = 39$$

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between the amount saved in the first and second halves of the month. Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will be 30 - x.

Let's assume the amount saved in the first half is y. Then, the amount saved in the second half will be 2y, as Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy. The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

3xy = 1125

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30. However, this equation doesn't provide any useful information.

"The total cost of the fruits can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of each fruit by its respective price and then adding the results together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 × $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 × $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 × $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

To find the change Verna received, we subtract the total cost from the $20 she gave: $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny after completing 20 tasks. Given that Jairus earns $0.8 per task and Jenny earns $0.5 per task, we can calculate their respective totals and then find the difference.

To find Jairus' total earnings, we multiply his earnings per task by the number of tasks completed: $0.8 * 20 = $16.

Similarly, to find Jenny's total earnings, we multiply her earnings per task by the number of tasks completed: $0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, to determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus' total earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

Therefore, the amount Jeff gets is $80."
"As a multiplication expert, I can tell you that the problem at hand involves a straightforward application of the multiplication operation. To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

The distance to work is 3 miles, and since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 × 3 = 6 miles.

Now, we need to multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works, which is 5 times a week. This can be represented as 6 × 5 = 30 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Jeff walks in a week is 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. This can be represented as 2 * 26, where 26 is the number of letters in the alphabet. Multiplying these values gives us 2 * 26 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters she has written so far. This is the sum of the letters from the first two steps: 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. To find the total number of letters she has written, we add this to the previous total: 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"The problem presented is a classic example of a geometric sequence, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant, known as the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 3, as each family calls 3 other families.

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:

an = a1 * r^(n-1)

where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

In this case, a1 = 3 (the initial number of families notified by Ali), r = 3 (the common ratio), and n = 4 (the round number we are interested in).

Plugging in these values, we get:

a4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
a4 = 3 * 3^3
a4 = 3 * 27
a4 = 81

Therefore, the number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The final answer is: 81"
"As a subtraction and multiplication expert, I can confidently solve this problem by reversing the process of weight loss. 

To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add it to his final weight. Since Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can use the multiplication operation to find the total weight lost:

Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months
Total weight lost = 10 × 3
Total weight lost = 30 pounds

Now, we can use the addition operation to find Mark's initial weight:

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Larger set = 5 * James's set
Larger set = 5 * 80
Larger set = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, I'll calculate 10% of the total cost: 0.10 × $30 = $3.

Finally, I'll subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel needs to spend: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"As an expert in arithmetic operations, I'll calculate the total cost of Carly's order and determine the change she receives.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: 10 × 0.30 = $3
5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: 5 × 2 = $10

Now, let's add these amounts together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17

Therefore, Carly receives $17 in change.

The final answer is: $17"
"A tiered commission structure is a common compensation model used in sales and marketing. In this case, the structure is as follows:

- A base commission of 30% is paid on the first $1000 in sales.
- An additional 10% commission is paid on sales exceeding $1000.

To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two categories: the first $1000 and the amount exceeding $1000.

Commission for the first $1000: 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300
Commission for the sales over $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
Additional commission for the sales over $1000: 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission: $300 + $150 = $450

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of bottles required for his party. 

Bill has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he already has is 2 x 24 = 48.

For his 70 guests, he wants to provide 2 bottles each, so the total number of bottles needed for his guests is 70 x 2 = 140.

To find the total number of bottles required, we add the number of bottles he already has to the number of bottles needed for his guests: 48 + 140 = 188.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, we need to find the difference between the total number of bottles required and the number he already has: 188 - 48 = 140.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 140 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the time difference between Ray's swim on a hot day and a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

First, let's find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day. We know that on a cold day, he swims a mile in 16 minutes. On a warm day, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. 

Time to swim a mile on a cold day = 16 minutes
Time to swim a mile on a warm day = 2 * 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time between the two days, we subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

Daily Earnings = Hourly Wage × Number of Hours Worked per Day
= $2/hour × 5 hours/day
= $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Weekly Earnings = Daily Earnings × Number of Days Worked per Week
= $10/day × 4 days/week
= $40/week

Now, we can divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:

Number of Weeks = Target Savings ÷ Weekly Earnings
= $80 ÷ $40/week
= 2 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. To find this, we can use the multiplication operation, which is a fundamental concept in arithmetic.

Multiplication is the operation of repeated addition, and in this case, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub three times. This can be represented as:

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 × Cost of the foot-long fish sub
= 3 × $40
= $120

Now, to find the total cost for both subs, we can add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:

Total cost = Cost of the foot-long fish sub + Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub
= $40 + $120
= $160

"As a subtraction and multiplication expert, I can confidently tackle this problem. 

To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes.

First, let's calculate the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes. This is a straightforward multiplication problem: 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes.

Next, we need to find the number of buttons with 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, we subtract 7 from 21 to get the number of buttons with 4 holes: 21 - 7 = 14 buttons.

Now, we multiply the number of buttons with 4 holes by the number of holes per button: 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes.

Finally, we add the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes to get the total number of holes: 14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we need to find the size of Zack's locker first, and then find one-fourth of that size.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can express this relationship as a fraction: Zack's locker = (1/2) × Timothy's locker. Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size as follows:

Zack's locker = (1/2) × 24
= (1/2) × 24
= 24/2
= 12 cubic inches

Now, to find Peter's locker size, we need to find one-fourth of Zack's locker size. This can be expressed as a fraction: Peter's locker = (1/4) × Zack's locker. Substituting the value of Zack's locker, we get:

Peter's locker = (1/4) × 12
= (1/4) × 12
= 12/4
= 3 cubic inches

Therefore, the size of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to establish the relationship between his current coffee consumption and the recommended daily amount.

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as R. We are given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, which can be expressed as R/2. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, his current coffee intake can be calculated as 10 * (R/2) = 5R.

We are also given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. Therefore, R = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5R = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving multiplication and addition. To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 3 × 10 = 30 hamsters.

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 3 × 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.

"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving addition, subtraction, and division. Given the weights of the three friends, we can calculate their average weight as follows:

Let's start by determining the weight of each friend. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so we can express her weight as 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Now, let's find Bob's weight, which is twice as much as Susan's. This can be calculated as 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to add their weights and divide by 3. The sum of their weights is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. Dividing this by 3 gives us the average weight: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

"Given the initial angle of the pyramid at 32 degrees and the sun's angular velocity of 5 degrees per hour, we can calculate the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours of movement.

The initial angle of the pyramid is θ0 = 32°. The sun's angular velocity is ω = 5°/hour. The time interval is Δt = 10 hours.

To find the final angle, we use the equation:

θf = θ0 + ω * Δt

Substituting the given values, we get:

θf = 32° + (5°/hour * 10 hours)
θf = 32° + 50°
θf = 82°

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of candles James needs, we must first calculate the sum of the ages of his two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The total number of candles needed is the sum of their ages: 12 + 8 = 20.

Since a pack of candles contains 5 candles, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of candles needed by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

Now, we need to find the cost of 4 packs of candles. Since each pack costs $3, we can multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 × 3 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate her reading rate and then apply it to the given time period.

First, let's establish Judy's reading rate. We know she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find her reading rate in pages per minute, we divide the number of pages by the time in minutes: 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 2/1.5 pages per minute.

To simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to get rid of the decimal: (2 * 2) / (1.5 * 2) = 4/3 pages per minute.

Now that we have Judy's reading rate, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total minutes she read in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

To find the total number of pages she read in the first week, we multiply her reading rate by the total minutes: (4/3 pages/minute) * 105 minutes = (4/3) * 105 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week: 140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which can be expressed as 12 × (1/4).

12 × (1/4) = 12/4 = 3 sandwiches.

Now, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor. This is simply the sum of their portions: 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total eaten from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's analyze the tooth fairy's payment structure:

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, resulting in a total of $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon by adding the amounts together:

Total = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00
Total = $9.00

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given the following information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: R = M + 20
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: R = A + 45
3. Richie scored 80 goals: R = 80

We can substitute the value of R from the third equation into the first two equations:

80 = M + 20
80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for M and A:

M = 80 - 20
M = 60

A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the values of M and A, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."

"As a seasoned expert in floral supply chain management, I've calculated the monthly demand for roses from the local flower shops. To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to multiply the weekly demand by 4 to get the monthly demand:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

Therefore, the correct answer is $600."
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of goods sold (COGS) consists of two components: direct materials and direct labor. In this case, the direct materials are the bread and cheese, while the direct labor is the time spent preparing the sandwiches. However, since the problem does not provide information on labor costs, we will focus on the direct materials.

Direct materials cost:
- Bread cost: The food truck purchases bread at $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.
- Cheese and condiments cost: The food truck spends $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches. To find the cost per sandwich, we divide the total cost by the number of sandwiches: $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

Total direct materials cost = $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich

Since the food truck sells 10 sandwiches, the total cost of goods sold is:
Total COGS = $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Selling price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

To calculate the net profit, we subtract the total COGS from the total revenue:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total COGS
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total amount of money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we need to calculate the total number of muffin crayons she can create and then multiply that number by the price of each muffin crayon.

3 boxes × 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Next, we need to find out how many muffin crayons she can make from these 192 crayons. Since each muffin crayon is made from 8 crayons, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8:

192 crayons ÷ 8 crayons/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now that we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price of each:

24 muffin crayons × $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the area of the bedroom, the cost of the materials, and the labor costs.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = length * width. In this case, the length is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area is:

A = 18 * 12 = 216 square feet

Now, let's calculate the cost of the materials. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is:

Carpet cost = 216 * $12 = $2592

The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is:

Padding cost = 216 * $2 = $432

The total cost of the materials is the sum of the carpet cost and the padding cost:

Total material cost = $2592 + $432 = $3024

Next, let's calculate the labor costs. The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is:

Removal cost = 216 * $4 = $864

The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is:

Installation cost = 216 * $34 = $7344

The total labor cost is the sum of the removal cost and the installation cost:

Total labor cost = $864 + $7344 = $8208

Finally, the total cost to replace the carpet is the sum of the total material cost and the total labor cost:

Total cost = $3024 + $8208 = $11232

The final answer is: $11232"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to determine the total number of birds observed over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

"Given the problem, we can break it down step by step using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

Let's denote the starting value of the number train as x. We are given that x = 20.

1. The expression ""half the number"" refers to x/2, which is 20/2 = 10.
2. The expression ""the starting value plus half the number"" is x + (x/2), which is 20 + 10 = 30.
3. The expression ""divided by 5"" implies division, so we have (x + (x/2))/5, which is (20 + 10)/5 = 30/5 = 6.
4. The expression ""the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12"" implies multiplication, so we have (x + (x/2))/5 * (x - 12), which is 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"When it comes to arithmetic operations, particularly addition and subtraction, I'm delighted to assist. In this scenario, we're dealing with a straightforward problem involving two variables.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off from its set temperature. This can be calculated by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then dividing it by the set temperature.

Let's denote the set temperature as S and the actual temperature as A. We are given that S = 450 and A = 468.

The percentage by which the oven is off is calculated as:

Percentage off = ((A - S) / S) * 100

Substituting the given values, we get:

Percentage off = ((468 - 450) / 450) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now that we know the oven is off by 4%, we can find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. Let's denote this temperature as T. We can set up the equation:

T = 520 - (4% of 520)

To find 4% of 520, we multiply 520 by 0.04:

4% of 520 = 520 * 0.04
= 20.8

Now, we can find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to:

T = 520 - 20.8
= 499.2

Since Maggie can't set the oven to a fraction of a degree, we can round to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, we are looking for the temperature she should set the oven to, not the actual temperature. Therefore, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

First, let's convert the time of the first movie into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can express 1 hour as 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

Next, we'll convert the time of the second movie into minutes. We can express 2 hours as 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Given the scenario, we can model the problem as a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of cups Judy brought as C and the number of dishes as D.

We know that Judy bought a dozen cups, so C = 12. We also know that she bought twice as many dishes as cups, so D = 2C. Substituting the value of C, we get D = 2(12) = 24.

Now, let's consider the information about Judy's friend. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. This can be represented as C_f = 40 and D_f = D + 20, where C_f is the number of cups her friend brought and D_f is the number of dishes her friend brought.

We can now set up a system of linear equations to represent the situation:

C = 12
D = 2C
C_f = 40
D_f = D + 20

Substituting the value of D from the second equation into the fourth equation, we get D_f = 2C + 20.

Now, we can solve for C and D by substituting the value of C from the first equation into the second equation. We get D = 2(12) = 24.

Now, let's find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend. The total number of cups is C + C_f = 12 + 40 = 52. The total number of dishes is D + D_f = 24 + (2(12) + 20) = 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend is the sum of the total number of cups and the total number of dishes: 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of the contacts and the total number of pairs.

First, let's find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have:
90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts
Since each box lasts 45 days, the total number of days the contacts will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the contacts with a 10% discount:
Original cost: 2 boxes * $100/box = $200
Discount: $200 * 0.10 = $20
Discounted cost: $200 - $20 = $180

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of pairs:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked a total of 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, which is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 × $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 × 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 × 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 × $10 = $70.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities. 

The calories burned from aerobics can be calculated as follows: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

The calories burned from running can be calculated as follows: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of the calories burned from aerobics and running: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can determine the total amount of water she needs to drink by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and then multiplying by 100.

First, we divide the total calories burned by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8.

Then, we multiply the result by 100 to find the total amount of water needed: 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"When dealing with systems of equations involving percentages, it's essential to approach the problem methodically. Let's break down the given information:

We have a jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans, with the following relationships:

1. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans: R = 0.99B
2. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans: G = 1.01B
3. The total number of jelly beans is 4500: B + R + G = 4500

To solve for the number of green jelly beans relative to the number of red jelly beans, we need to find the values of R and G. 

First, substitute the expressions for R and G into the total equation:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to first determine the values of the three measurements. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM). His second typing speed is 52 WPM. To find his third typing speed, we add 5 words per minute to his second typing speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we can calculate the average of the three measurements by adding them up and dividing by 3. The sum of the measurements is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"Weight change calculations are a fundamental aspect of my expertise as a weight change analyst. When evaluating the impact of dietary choices on weight, it's essential to consider the net effect over time.

Given that Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Conversely, if he consumes donuts daily, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. To determine the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the net weight change for each option.

Weight change due to Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight change due to donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is calculated by subtracting the weight lost from the weight gained: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, let's consider the people invited via email. Each of the 100 invited individuals will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, we need to account for the people invited by Alex's friends. She calls 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, resulting in 10 + 8 = 18 additional people.

To find the total number of people attending, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of people invited by Alex's friends: 300 + 18 = 318.

However, this count includes Alex herself, so we need to add 1 to the total to account for her presence.

The final answer is: 319"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow a step-by-step process of multiplication and division.

First, we know the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, which weighs 10 pounds. Therefore, the Dachshund's weight can be calculated as follows:

2 × 10 = 20 pounds

Next, we are told that the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. To find the Papillon's weight, we divide the Dachshund's weight by 4:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 pounds

Now, we are given that the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. To find the Mastiff's weight, we multiply the Papillon's weight by 44:

44 × 5 = 220 pounds

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"When comparing the cost of a pair of boots on Amazon and eBay, we need to consider both the cost of the boots and the shipping fees.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping fee is $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, but the shipping fee is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to find the difference between the total cost on eBay and the total cost on Amazon: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of exponential growth, where the height of the beanstalk doubles every day. Given that the initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet and it doubles in height daily, we can model this situation using the equation:

h(t) = 4 * 2^t

where h(t) is the height of the beanstalk at time t (in days) and t is the number of days.

We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet, which can be expressed as:

4 * 2^t > 20

To solve for t, we can divide both sides by 4:

2^t > 5

Now, we need to find the smallest integer value of t that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by trial and error or by using logarithms. In this case, we can use trial and error to find that:

2^3 = 8 (less than 5)
2^4 = 16 (less than 5)
2^5 = 32 (greater than 5)

Therefore, it will take 5 days for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of protein John gets per week, we need to establish the ratio of protein to the weight of mushrooms. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, the ratio of protein to weight is 3 grams of protein per 100 grams of mushrooms.

This ratio can be expressed as a fraction: 3/100. To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. The simplified ratio is 3/100.

Now, we need to find out how many grams of protein John gets per day. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of protein he consumes daily. The proportion is:

(3/100) = x/200

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 3 * 200 = 100 * x, which simplifies to 600 = 100x. Dividing both sides by 100, we get x = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple linear equation. Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

First, we calculate the total base price of the implants: 2 implants * $2000 per implant = $4000.

Next, we add the cost of the crown: $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Now, we subtract the deposit George has already paid: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations representing the relationship between the angles in a triangle. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

We know that one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it can be represented as 2x. Similarly, one angle is three times the smallest angle, which can be represented as 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the other two angles. One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees. The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total amount of money Colby has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15
= 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

First, let's consider the number of legs for each type of pet. Dogs have 4 legs each, cats have 4 legs each, and birds have 2 legs each.

We can represent the number of legs for each type of pet as follows:

- Dogs: 5 x 4 = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 x 4 = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 x 2 = 20 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 + 8 + 20 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

To find 50% of 8 pounds, we multiply 8 by 0.5, which is a common method for calculating percentages. This gives us 8 * 0.5 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, so we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds. This is a simple subtraction problem: 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he gets each year and add them up.

Let's break it down:

- In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

- In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

- In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"Given the plane's speed of 400 miles per hour, we can use the formula Distance = Rate × Time to determine the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Let's denote the unknown time as t. We can set up the equation as follows:

2000 = 400 × t

To solve for t, we divide both sides of the equation by 400:

t = 2000 / 400
t = 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the individual rates of work for Ruiz and Marissa, and then find their combined rate of work.

Ruiz's rate of work is 120 pounds of chocolates per 2 hours. To find his rate per hour, we divide the total pounds by the total hours: 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa's rate of work is 3/4 times Ruiz's rate. To find Marissa's rate, we multiply Ruiz's rate by 3/4: (3/4) * 60 pounds per hour = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we need to find their combined rate of work. To do this, we add their individual rates: 60 pounds per hour (Ruiz) + 45 pounds per hour (Marissa) = 105 pounds per hour.

Since they work together for 12 hours, we multiply their combined rate by the total hours: 105 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount.

Let's break down the expenses:

- On Monday, Howard spent $8.
- On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 × $8 = $16.
- On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 × $16 = $64.

The total amount spent is the sum of these expenses: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Now, to find the amount of money Howard has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To calculate the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each period, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the first four hours. Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. The total number of cups sold in 4 hours is 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups. The total amount earned in 4 hours is 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

Next, let's calculate the total amount earned from the next two hours. Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. The total number of cups sold in 2 hours is 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups. The total amount earned in 2 hours is 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Now, we add the total amount earned in both periods to find the total amount earned in 6 hours: $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the lifespan of the tires, we need to establish the rate at which they rotate and then calculate how long they can sustain that rate before reaching their maximum allowed rotations.

Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can express this as a rate of 725 rotations per 2 miles, or 362.5 rotations per mile.

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires can undergo in a month. Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, so we multiply the monthly mileage by the rotations per mile:

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 362.5 rotations/mile = 145,000 rotations/month

We're told that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement. To find the number of months the tires can last, we divide the total allowed rotations by the monthly rotations:

Months before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12:

Years before replacement = 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to convert the total cost from dollars to cents and then divide it by the total number of pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

Now, we can calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost in cents by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump = Total cost in cents / Total number of pumps
= 2400 cents / 240 pumps
= 10 cents per pump

Therefore, the cost per pump of the shampoo is 10 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt:
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has:
Amount left = $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: $-2.50"
"To determine the amount of butter needed to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants. Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we can multiply the number of dozen croissants by 12.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we need to find the amount of butter required to make 336 croissants. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we can multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen, which is equivalent to multiplying the total number of croissants by 1/12 (since 1/4 = 2/8 = 1/4 = 1/12).

336 croissants * (1/12) = 336/12 = 28

However, we need to multiply this by 1/4 to get the total amount of butter in pounds. We can do this by multiplying 28 by 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing 28 by 4.

28 * (1/4) = 28/4 = 7

Alternatively, we can multiply 28 by 1/4 directly.

28 * (1/4) = 7

"To determine the cost difference in repaving Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

The cost per meter to repave a street is $194. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street: 
$194/meter * 150 meters = $29,100

Next, we'll calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street: 
$194/meter * 490 meters = $95,060

Now, to find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street: 
$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

"The problem at hand involves calculating the total cost of John's research, which spans 50 months, with a unique funding structure. We can break down the problem into two distinct phases: the initial 5 months and the subsequent 45 months.

For the first 5 months, the funding is a straightforward $100,000 per month. Therefore, the total cost for this phase is:

$$\text{Cost}_\text{initial} = 5 \times \$100,000 = \$500,000$$

However, for the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% of the initial amount, which is $50,000. This means the new funding rate is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

To calculate the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we can use the formula for the future value of an annuity:

$$FV = P \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right)$$

where:
- $FV$ is the future value (total cost for the remaining 45 months),
- $P$ is the monthly payment ($150,000),
- $r$ is the monthly interest rate (0, since this is a flat rate and not an interest rate),
- $n$ is the number of payments (45 months).

However, since this is a flat rate and not an interest rate, we can simplify the calculation by multiplying the monthly payment by the number of payments:

$$\text{Cost}_\text{remaining} = \$150,000 \times 45 = \$6,750,000$$

Now, we can find the total cost of the research by adding the cost of the initial phase and the cost of the remaining phase:

$$\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost}_\text{initial} + \text{Cost}_\text{remaining} = \$500,000 + \$6,750,000 = \$7,250,000$$

The final answer is: $7,250,000"
"As a unit conversion expert, I'll break down the problem step by step to ensure accurate calculations.

First, let's convert the weight of the third player's steak from pounds to ounces. We know that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces. Therefore, the third player's one-pound steak is equivalent to 16 ounces.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of meat consumed by the team:

- The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
- The second player ate 8 ounces of beef tips.
- The third player ate 16 ounces of steak.

To find the total amount of meat consumed, we'll add these values together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to consider the daily posting rate and the number of days in the month.

Given that each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is calculated as follows:

1000 members * 3 posts/member = 3000 posts/day

Since March has 31 days, we can find the total number of posts in March by multiplying the daily posting rate by the number of days:

3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93,000.

The final answer is: 93000"
"To determine the annual cost of water for laundry, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, which translates to 2 loads per week. To find the total number of loads in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total amount of water used in a year is 104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15. To find the total cost of water used in a year, we multiply the total gallons used by the cost per gallon: 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving addition and multiplication. To calculate the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to break down the costs and perform the necessary calculations.

First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each is 2 × $2.50 = $5.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each is 3 × $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, let's determine the cost of the fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each is 20 × $0.50 = $10.00.

We also need to account for the cost of the fish food, which is $2.00.

To find the total amount spent, we add the costs together: $10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00.

The final answer is: $33.00"
"The height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks can be calculated by understanding its growth pattern. 

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. To find its height at the end of the second week, we need to double its initial height, which is a simple multiplication problem: 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

Now, we need to add the growth that occurred in the third week, which was 4 inches. To find the total height, we add this growth to the height at the end of the second week: 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"As a division expert specializing in unit conversions, I'll tackle this problem with precision. Given that Prince sells 15kg of meat per hour and works 10 hours a day, we can calculate his daily meat sales in kilograms. However, to find the number of days it will take to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to convert the weight of the bull's meat into hours of sales.

Since Prince sells 15kg of meat per hour, we can convert the bull's weight from kilograms to hours by dividing the weight by the hourly sales rate. The bull weighs 750kg, so we'll divide this by 15kg/hour to get the equivalent hours of sales: 750 kg / 15 kg/hour = 50 hours.

Now, we know Prince works 10 hours a day. To find the number of days it will take to sell the meat from the bull, we'll divide the total hours of sales by the daily hours worked: 50 hours / 10 hours/day = 5 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, we can calculate this as follows:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 4 × 18 = 72 seats

Next, we determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the total seats are occupied by the administrators, which can be calculated as:

Administrators = 1/4 × 72 = 72 × 1/4 = 18 seats

Now, we find the remaining seats after subtracting the seats occupied by the administrators:

Remaining seats = Total seats - Administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Then, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats are occupied by the parents, which can be calculated as:

Parents = 1/3 × 54 = 54 × 1/3 = 18 seats

Finally, we find the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we need to calculate the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

First, we calculate the total number of poles at all intersections. Since each intersection has 6 poles and there are 4 intersections, we multiply the number of poles per intersection by the number of intersections:

Total poles = 6 poles/intersection * 4 intersections = 6 * 4 = 24 poles

Next, we calculate the total number of street lights. Each pole has 4 street lights, so we multiply the total number of poles by the number of street lights per pole:

Total street lights = 24 poles * 4 street lights/pole = 24 * 4 = 96 street lights

Now, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of street lights to find the number of functioning lights:

Functioning lights = Total street lights - Non-functioning lights
= 96 - 20
= 76

The final answer is: 76"
"When it comes to calculating the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, I apply the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, I determine the number of times each DVD has been played: DVD 1 has been played 356 times, and DVD 2 has been played 135 times. 

Next, I calculate the remaining number of times each DVD can be played: 1000 - 356 = 644 for DVD 1, and 1000 - 135 = 865 for DVD 2.

Now, I add the remaining times for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

"The calculation of the total cost of physical therapy sessions involves a straightforward application of multiplication principles. To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended physical therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

Let's break it down:

1. Total number of sessions = 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions
2. Total hours = 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

Now, we apply the multiplication principle to find the total cost:

Total cost = Total hours * Cost per hour
= 24 hours * $125/hour
= $3000

Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate this as follows:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

Next, we need to account for the gum he chews on the way home and after dinner. This adds 2 more pieces to the total.

Total pieces chewed so far: 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6

Now, let's calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim has remaining after chewing 6 pieces. We start with 20 pieces and subtract the ones he's already chewed:

20 - 6 = 14

However, we need to consider the fact that Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he gives her, we'll divide the remaining gum by 2:

14 / 2 = 7

Since Jim gives his sister 7 pieces, we need to subtract this from the remaining gum to find out how many pieces he has left:

14 - 7 = 7

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Charmaine's current age and then calculate her age 4 years from now. 

Since Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can find her current age by subtracting 12 from 16: 

16 - 12 = 4

This means Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age: 

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the difference in the amounts spent by two sports coaches. To approach this, we need to calculate the total expenditure for each coach and then find the difference between the two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach. The coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each. This can be represented as:

9 × 3 = $27

Next, we'll calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach. The coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, which can be represented as:

8 × 14 = $112

Now, to find the difference between the two amounts, we'll subtract the baseball coach's expenditure from the basketball coach's expenditure:

$112 - $27 = $85

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers is 10 × 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can calculate the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5.

4/5 × 200 = (4 × 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"Converting kilobits per second to megabits per hour is a straightforward process that involves two steps: converting kilobits to megabits and then scaling the result to an hourly rate.

First, we know that 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb). Therefore, to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb/s to Mb/s, we divide her speed by 1000:

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Next, we need to scale this rate to an hourly rate. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the result by 3600:

0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h."
"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the total number of cars towed by the truck.

To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The number of cars towed on the remaining days is 7 - 3 = 4 days. Since 4 fewer cars were towed on each of these days, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

The total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to establish a ratio of his growth rate to the difference between his current height and the required height.

Let's denote the required height as \(H_r = 4 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ inches}\) and Adam's current height as \(H_c = 40 \text{ inches}\). Given that Adam grows at a rate of 2 inches per year, we can express his growth as a linear function: \(H(t) = H_c + 2t\), where \(t\) is the time in years.

We want to find the time \(t\) when Adam's height will be equal to the required height, so we set up the equation:

\[H(t) = H_r\]
\[H_c + 2t = H_r\]
\[40 + 2t = 48\]

Subtracting 40 from both sides gives us:

\[2t = 8\]

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

\[t = 4\]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars, which is 30% of the total cost. This can be expressed as: 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, we can calculate the profit from selling the cars by subtracting the company's cost from the total revenue: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit, which is 10% of the profit. This can be expressed as: 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to calculate the percentage of men among the riders who can stay upright.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright. This is equivalent to 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Next, we are given that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, to find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let G be the price of the gold Jewell. Then, we have:

G = (4/5) * 2000

To find the price of the gold Jewell, we can simplify the equation:

G = (4/5) * 2000
= 4 * 400
= 1600

Given that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let S be the price of the silver Jewell. Then, we have:

S = G - 400
= 1600 - 400
= 1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck and rose stamps first. 

Let's start with the snowflake stamps. Max bought 16 of these. 

Next, we need to find the number of truck stamps. Since Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, we can express this as: truck stamps = snowflake stamps + 3. Substituting the value of snowflake stamps, we get truck stamps = 16 + 3 = 19.

Now, let's find the number of rose stamps. Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so we can express this as: rose stamps = truck stamps - 9. Substituting the value of truck stamps, we get rose stamps = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now that we have the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding these values together: total stamps = snowflake stamps + truck stamps + rose stamps = 16 + 19 + 10.

Performing the addition, we get: total stamps = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"When analyzing the situation, we need to consider the relative motion between Bob and Tom. The key concept here is the concept of relative speed, which is the difference between their speeds. In this case, Tom is driving at 70 mph, while Bob is driving at 55 mph. The relative speed is therefore 70 - 55 = 15 mph.

To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Given that the distance between them is 75 miles, we can plug in the values:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"When solving word problems involving comparisons and subtractions, it's essential to break down the information provided and address each component systematically. In this scenario, we're given that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, and Darren caught 6 fewer fish than Naomi.

Let's denote the number of fish Naomi caught as N. Since Darren caught 6 fewer fish than Naomi, the number of fish Darren caught can be expressed as N - 6. We're also given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17.

Now, we can substitute the value of N into the expression for Darren's catch: N - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11. This means Darren caught 11 fish.

Given that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can express Tommy's catch as (N - 6) + 3. Substituting the value of N, we get (17 - 6) + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny attends at $6 per class as x and the number of classes he attends at $10 per class as y. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

The equation representing the total cost is:

6x + 10y = 60

Since we want to find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend at $6 per class, we can try different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"When analyzing the problem, we need to consider the ratio of Julie's speed to Jewel's speed and the number of customers each processes daily. Given that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, we can express this as a ratio: Julie's speed : Jewel's speed = 2 : 1.

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, we can use this ratio to find Julie's daily production. To do this, we multiply Jewel's daily production by the ratio of Julie's speed to Jewel's speed: 50 * (2/1) = 100 customers per day.

Now, we need to find the total weekly production for each. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily production by 7: 100 * 7 = 700 customers per week for Julie, and 50 * 7 = 350 customers per week for Jewel.

To find the total weekly production for the two, we add their individual weekly productions: 700 + 350 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as L, Reggie ran as R, and Paisley ran as P.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles, so P = 4.

We also know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so R = 5P = 5(4) = 20.

Furthermore, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can write the equation R = L + 3. Substituting the value of R, we get 20 = L + 3.

To find the value of L, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: L = 20 - 3 = 17.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the cost of one apple as 'a' and the cost of one orange as 'o'.

We are given that four apples cost $5.20 and three oranges cost $3.30. We can write the following equations:

4a = 5.20  ... (Equation 1)
3o = 3.30  ... (Equation 2)

We are asked to find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges. To do this, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'o'. We can solve the system of equations using either substitution or elimination method.

Let's use the elimination method. We can multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 4 to make the coefficients of 'a' and 'o' the same:

12a = 15.60  ... (Equation 3)
12o = 13.20  ... (Equation 4)

Now, we can subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3 to eliminate 'o':

12a - 12o = 15.60 - 13.20
12(a - o) = 2.40
a - o = 0.20  ... (Equation 5)

Now, we can solve for 'a' using Equation 1 and Equation 5:

4a = 5.20
a = 1.30

Now that we have the value of 'a', we can substitute it into Equation 5 to solve for 'o':

1.30 - o = 0.20
o = 1.10

Now that we have the values of 'a' and 'o', we can find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:

Cost of 5 apples = 5a = 5(1.30) = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5o = 5(1.10) = $5.50

The total cost is the sum of the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to determine the volume of the hole first. The formula for volume is length times width times depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we need to calculate the time it will take to dig the hole. Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: 216"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $\frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To determine Tim's total annual income, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. To find 5% of $20,000, we multiply $20,000 by 0.05, which is the decimal equivalent of 5%.

$20,000 × 0.05 = $1,000

Now, we add the 5% raise to his original monthly salary to find his new monthly salary.

$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary.

Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly income by adding the new monthly salary and the bonus.

Total monthly income = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, we calculate the total annual income by multiplying the total monthly income by 12.

Total annual income = $31,000 × 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To determine the total cost of James' wardrobe, we need to break down the expenses into individual components and calculate each one.

First, let's find the cost of the suits: 10 suits * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the dress pants. Since they cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we can find the cost of one dress pant by dividing the cost of a suit by 5: $750 / 5 = $150. Then, we multiply this by the number of dress pants: 10 pants * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 shirts per suit, and there are 10 suits. So, the total number of shirts is 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts. The cost of each shirt is $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 shirts * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can confidently calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February.

To find the total number of articles published by the news website, we multiply the average number of articles per day (20) by the number of days in February (28):
20 articles/day × 28 days = 20 × 28 = 560 articles

Similarly, to find the total number of articles published by the sister company, we multiply the average number of articles per day (10) by the number of days in February (28):
10 articles/day × 28 days = 10 × 28 = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:

"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to establish the age relationships between the family members.

Let's start by identifying the age of Steve's wife, who is 4 years older than Steve. Since Steve is 60 years old, his wife's age can be calculated as follows:

Steve's wife's age = Steve's age + 4
= 60 + 4
= 64 years old

Next, we know that their son is half as old as his mother. Therefore, we can calculate his age as follows:

Son's age = Mother's age / 2
= 64 / 2
= 32 years old

Now, we are given that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. To find her age, we subtract 3 from her husband's age:

Son's wife's age = Son's age - 3
= 32 - 3
= 29 years old

Therefore, the age of Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is: 29"
"The problem at hand is a straightforward application of multiplication. We're given that a bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to calculate the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

To find the total amount of flour in one bag, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion: 8 × 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3: 16 × 3 = 48 kilograms.

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"To calculate the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to apply the fundamental principles of multiplication and addition.

First, we calculate the distance covered by Alisa, which is a straightforward application of the formula: distance = speed × time. In this case, Alisa's speed is 12 miles per hour, and she biked for 4.5 hours. Therefore, her distance is 12 × 4.5 = 54 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance covered by Stanley, using the same formula: distance = speed × time. Stanley's speed is 10 miles per hour, and he biked for 2.5 hours. Thus, his distance is 10 × 2.5 = 25 miles.

Now, to find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we apply the principle of addition. We add their individual distances: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The final answer is: 79"
"When calculating the time it takes to dig a well, we need to consider the varying rates at which Bill can dig through different materials. Given that he can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that rate through clay, we can determine the time required for each section of the well.

The rate at which Bill digs through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through each section:

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to dig through both sections: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"As a multiplication expert, I can tell you that when it comes to calculating the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to consider the total number of people and multiply it by 2.

To find the total number of people, we add the number of classmates to the number of people already accounted for (Howie and his teacher). This is a simple addition problem:

1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Now, we multiply the total number of people by 2 to find the total number of cupcakes needed:

2 × 27 = 54

Therefore, the correct answer is 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, let's establish the initial number of likes Fishio received on her selfie, which is 2000. 

Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This can be represented as 70 * 2000. 

70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, we need to determine the total number of likes after Fishio received 20000 more new likes. To do this, we add the new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks.

Total likes = 140000 + 20000.

To calculate this, we can add the numbers together.

140000 + 20000 = 160000.

Therefore, the total number of likes on Fishio's Instagram post is 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount due to a voucher. The total cost is calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of pomegranates × Price per pomegranate - Discount
= 20 × $20 - $2
= $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and a 10% discount was offered on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
Total cost = Number of pomegranates × Price per pomegranate
= 20 × $30
= $600

The discount is 10% of the total cost, which is:
Discount = Total cost × Discount percentage
= $600 × 0.1
= $60

The total cost with the discount is:
Total cost = Total cost - Discount
= $600 - $60
= $540

Now, we can calculate the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
Difference = Total cost on the first day - Total cost on the second day
= $398 - $540
= -$142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the given information:

- The sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats.
- The total sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales in the first month.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as x. Since the sales from red hats in the first month are half of the total sales from green hats, we can write the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800, and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from green and red hats:

Total sales in the first month = $800 + $400
Total sales in the first month = $1200

Now, let's find the total sales in the second month, which is 3/4 of the total sales in the first month:

Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200
Total sales in the second month = 0.75 * $1200
Total sales in the second month = $900

To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months:

Total amount made in two months = $1200 + $900
Total amount made in two months = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"As a seasoned cost analyst, I'll break down the cost calculation for James' horse-drawn carriage rental.

The total duration of the rental is 4 hours, but James receives a 1-hour discount, making the paid hours 3. The cost structure is as follows:

- The first hour costs $15.
- Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

To calculate the total cost, we multiply the cost of the first hour by the number of hours and add the cost of the remaining hours. Since the first hour is $15 and the subsequent hours are $30 each, the total cost is:

Total Cost = (Cost of first hour) + (Number of subsequent hours * Cost of subsequent hours)
= $15 + (2 * $30)
= $15 + $60
= $75

Therefore, James paid a total of $75 for the horse-drawn carriage rental.

The final answer is: $75"

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs, we first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required for her guests. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 × 3 = 48

Since each egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the number of eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

Number of deviled egg halves: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 ÷ 2 = 24

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

Number of eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12
Number of dozens of eggs needed: 24 ÷ 12 = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate 2/3 of the total pages since she has already finished 1/3 of the paper.

Let's start by identifying the total number of pages: 15. To find 1/3 of 15, we can multiply 15 by 1/3, which is equivalent to dividing 15 by 3.

1/3 * 15 = 15 / 3 = 5

Since Shiela has already written 5 pages, we need to find 2/3 of the total pages. To do this, we can multiply 15 by 2/3, which is equivalent to dividing 15 by 3 and then multiplying by 2.

2/3 * 15 = (15 / 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: 10"
"As a division expert, I can confidently calculate the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book. To do this, I'll simply divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = 200 ÷ 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, I'll subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"The cost of acquiring a plane is a straightforward calculation, but the ongoing expenses can add up quickly. To determine the total cost of owning a plane for a year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the monthly hanger rental, and the fuel costs.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To find the total hanger rental cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. To find the total fuel cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add the initial purchase price, the hanger rental cost, and the fuel cost to find the total cost of owning the plane for a year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the time it takes to cook rice as R, the time to cook pork as P, and the time to cook beans as B.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. P = R + 20 (It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice)
2. B = (R + P) / 2 (Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice)
3. R = 30 (It took her 30 minutes to cook rice)

Substituting the value of R into equation 1, we get:
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Now, substitute the values of R and P into equation 2:
B = (30 + 50) / 2
B = 80 / 2
B = 40

Now that we have the values of R, P, and B, we can find the total cooking time:
Total cooking time = R + P + B
Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40
Total cooking time = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To calculate the cost of the mixtures, we can use the weighted average formula, which is the sum of the product of each item's weight and price divided by the total weight.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
Weighted average cost = ((1/2 * $10) + (1/3 * $15)) / (1/2 + 1/3)
Weighted average cost = ($5 + $5) / (3/6 + 2/6)
Weighted average cost = $10 / (5/6)
Weighted average cost = $10 * (6/5)
Weighted average cost = $12

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
Weighted average cost = ((1/5 * $10) + (1/3 * $15)) / (1/5 + 1/3)
Weighted average cost = ($2 + $5) / (3/15 + 5/15)
Weighted average cost = $7 / (8/15)
Weighted average cost = $7 * (15/8)
Weighted average cost = $10.625

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Weighted average cost of the first mixture - Weighted average cost of the second mixture
Difference = $12 - $10.625
Difference = $1.375

The final answer is: $1.375"
"Given the problem, we have a system of two linear equations:

4S + 2G = 70  ... (Equation 1)
S + G = 20  ... (Equation 2)

We can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use the substitution method.

From Equation 2, we can express G in terms of S: G = 20 - S.

Substituting this expression for G into Equation 1, we get:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expanding the equation, we get:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combining like terms, we get:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

S = 15

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to consider the cost of the coffee and the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but since his favorite brand was sold out, he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5 and add it to the original price.

20% of $5 is calculated as 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
The more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the coffee and the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"

"As a subtraction expert, I can confidently calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B by subtracting the sum of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Let's break it down:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we need to subtract the sum of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

Therefore, the correct answer is 193."
"To determine the number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 × 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 × 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we need to divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe, which is 1.5 hours. This can be expressed as a division problem: 48 ÷ 1.5.

To perform this division, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal: (48 × 2) ÷ (1.5 × 2) = 96 ÷ 3.

Now, we can perform the division: 96 ÷ 3 = 32.

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the collective sleeping time of the math teachers, we first need to calculate the number of math teachers on the court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can find the number of history teachers as follows:

Number of history teachers = 60% of 150
= 0.6 * 150
= 90

Now, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Given the scenario, we can represent the amount of money each person has as a system of linear equations. Let's denote the amount of money Aurelia has as A, Kassidy has as K, and Rayna has as R.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia: K = (3/4)A
2. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy: R = K + 60

We also know that Aurelia has $120. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:
K = (3/4)(120)
K = 90

Now, we can substitute the value of K into the second equation to find the amount of money Rayna has:
R = 90 + 60
R = 150

To find the total amount of money they have, we add the amounts of money each person has:
Total money = A + K + R
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

"To determine the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to establish the initial height in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the initial height of 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet × 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

Δh = h_target - h_initial
Δh = 600 inches - 240 inches
Δh = 360 inches

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can use the formula for linear growth to solve for the number of days (t) it will take to reach the target height:

h_initial + (rate × t) = h_target
240 inches + (30 inches/day × t) = 600 inches

Subtracting 240 inches from both sides of the equation gives us:

30 inches/day × t = 360 inches

Now, we can solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by the growth rate (30 inches/day):

t = 360 inches / (30 inches/day)
t = 12 days

Therefore, it will take the bamboo 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which means each dog has 1 toy. With 8 more dogs in the shelter, he needs 8 additional toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys.

When James returns, he finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. The total number of dogs is now 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 (initial toys) + 28 (additional toys) = 40 toys.

However, when James returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 37 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{37}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. We know that three people invested a total of $1200 in a joint savings account. Let's start by finding the amount invested by Dylan, which is 2/5 of the total amount.

Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200
Dylan's investment = 480

Now, we need to find the remaining amount after Dylan's investment. This can be calculated by subtracting Dylan's investment from the total amount.

Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
Remaining amount = 1200 - 480
Remaining amount = 720

Next, we need to find the amount invested by Frances, which is 2/3 of the remaining amount.

Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720
Frances' investment = 480

Now, we need to find the remaining amount after Frances' investment. This can be calculated by subtracting Frances' investment from the remaining amount.

Remaining amount = 720 - 480
Remaining amount = 240

This remaining amount represents Skyler's investment.

"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we first calculate the total signatures they have so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can determine the number of signatures they need to collect per week by dividing the total signatures needed by the number of weeks.

Signatures needed per week = 36 ÷ 3 = 12

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we first need to calculate her hourly wage. Since she earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, we calculate the total hours Karen works in two days. Given that she works 3 hours per day, her total hours worked in two days is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find Karen's total earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportionality. Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can establish a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as 6:36 or 1:6. This ratio indicates that for every 1 potato, we can make 6 hash browns.

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 6
6x = 576
x = 96

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 96 * 6 = 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"As a multiplication and subtraction expert, I can confidently calculate the excess weight of the 9 adults in the elevator.

To find the total weight of the 9 adults, I'll multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. This is a straightforward application of the multiplication operation.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg × 9 = 720 kg

Now, to find the excess weight, I'll subtract the maximum load from the total weight of the 9 adults. This is a simple subtraction operation.

Maximum load = 700 kg
Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"Given the problem, we can represent the number of cookies each person has as variables. Let's denote the number of cookies Max has as M, the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as C, and the number of cookies Summer has as S. We are given the following system of equations:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: K = M - 5
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: M = C + 12
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: S = M + 23
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: K = 68

We can substitute the value of K from equation 4 into equation 1 to get M - 5 = 68, which simplifies to M = 73. Now, we can substitute the value of M into equation 2 to get C + 12 = 73, which simplifies to C = 61. Finally, we can substitute the value of M into equation 3 to get S = 73 + 23, which simplifies to S = 96.

Now that we have the number of cookies each person has, we can find the total number of cookies by adding them together: K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"When dealing with percentage changes, it's essential to understand that extending the dress by 50% of its original length means the new length is 150% of the original length. This can be represented as 1.5x, where x is the original length.

Given that the final design is 140cm long, we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: 1.5x = 120.

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to find the value of x: x = 120 / 1.5.

x = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"When calculating the time it takes to complete a task with multiple modes, it's essential to consider the weighted average of the time intervals. In this case, Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

Let's denote the time in turtle mode as $t_{turtle} = 60$ minutes and the time in rabbit mode as $t_{rabbit} = 40$ minutes. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, the weighted average of the time intervals can be calculated as:

$$\frac{1}{2}t_{turtle} + \frac{1}{2}t_{rabbit} = \frac{1}{2}(60) + \frac{1}{2}(40)$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2}(60 + 40) = \frac{1}{2}(100) = 50$$

Therefore, the weighted average of the time intervals is 50 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"Subtraction is my domain, and I'm delighted to tackle this problem. Given the scenario, we need to calculate the remaining time John and Jack have to get to school without being late.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Total time they have to reach school = 30 minutes
2. Time taken to get to the fire station = 6 minutes (to the library) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

Therefore, the correct answer is 11 minutes."

"The art of arithmetic operations. In this case, we're dealing with a simple yet elegant problem involving addition and subtraction. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 × 30 = 60 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda: 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

However, the pair decides to indulge in 10 cookies while they're cooling. To find the number of cookies left in the box, we subtract 10 from the total: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, the correct answer is 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Given the problem, we have two equations based on the information provided:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 37/3

To find the age of the older twin, we need to add 7 to the age of the triplet: T+7 = (37/3) + 7

To add 7 to 37/3, we need to convert 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 3: 7 = 21/3

Now we can add: T+7 = (37/3) + (21/3) = 58/3

To convert the improper fraction to a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 58 ÷ 3 = 19 with a remainder of 1

So, the age of the older twin is 19 years and 1 month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's calculate the total time John has before dinner in minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we'll add up the time John spends on homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we'll subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"Given the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the cost of one lollipop as L and the cost of one candy as C.

We are given that the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, which can be represented as:

5L + 4C = 3.20

We are also given that the cost of one lollipop is $0.40, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

5(0.40) + 4C = 3.20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2.00 + 4C = 3.20

Subtracting 2.00 from both sides, we get:

4C = 1.20

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

C = 0.30

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10L = 10(0.40) = 4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10C = 10(0.30) = 3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Let's denote Rong's monthly savings as R = 20 coins. Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, we can express Neil's monthly savings as N = R + (2/5)R = 20 + (2/5)(20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: R * 12 = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: N * 12 = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

To find their total savings after 10 years, we multiply their annual savings by 10:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To determine the amount John leaves with after visiting the vet, we need to calculate the total bill and subtract it from the amount he brought.

First, let's find the total cost of the vaccines: 2 vaccines at $20 each is 2 × $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 × $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of its individual components. 

Let's start by identifying the cost of each fruit. We know that one apple costs $0.5. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1. 

Oranges are the most expensive, costing three times as much as a banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of squares of each color:

- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is the total number of squares, which is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"Given the scenario, we need to determine the number of additional chairs required to accommodate the attendees at Mia's restaurant. 

First, let's establish the total number of chairs needed. We have 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs required is 57.

The restaurant has 8 high chairs, and it's mentioned that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is 5 times the number of high chairs, which is 5 * 8 = 40.

To find the total number of chairs available, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs: 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48.

Now, to determine the number of additional chairs needed, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs required: 57 (total chairs required) - 48 (total chairs available) = 9.

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs to accommodate all the attendees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we need to calculate the percentage of bucks that are 8 points. 

First, we find the number of bucks, which is 50% of the total deer population. This can be calculated as 0.5 * 50 = 25 bucks.

Next, we need to find 20% of the bucks that are 8 points. This is a straightforward calculation: 0.2 * 25 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total points collected by class 3B, we need to calculate the points earned by each student and then sum them up.

Let's start by finding Betty's points. Since she collected 30% more points than Adam, we can express this as an equation: Betty's points = Adam's points + 30% of Adam's points. 

Given Adam has 50 points, we can calculate 30% of 50 as 0.3 * 50 = 15. Therefore, Betty's points = 50 + 15 = 65.

Next, we need to find Tom's points. It's given that Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = Betty's points - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35.

Now, we're told that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. This can be expressed as Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points = 3 * 35 = 105.

To find the total points collected by the class, we add up the points earned by each student: Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold: 400 - 255 = 145.

The final answer is: $\boxed{145}$"
"As an expert in calculating powers of a number, I can approach this problem by recognizing it as a simple application of exponentiation. The problem states that each of Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren has 3 children, and each of those children has 3 children of their own. This can be represented as 3^2, where 3 is the base and 2 is the exponent, since we are raising 3 to the power of 2.

To calculate 3^2, we multiply 3 by itself: 3 * 3 = 9. However, this is not the final step. We are asked to find the number of great grand-babies, which is the result of raising 3 to the power of 3 (3^3), since each of the 9 grandchildren has 3 children.

To calculate 3^3, we multiply 3 by itself three times: 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies is 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the amount Greta has left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment, we need to calculate the deductions from her paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account. This is a straightforward 50% deduction, which can be expressed as 0.5 x $2400.00. Performing the calculation, we get:

0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00

Next, we calculate the amount she uses for her car payment, which is a 20% deduction. This can be expressed as 0.2 x $2400.00. Performing the calculation, we get:

0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00

Now, we subtract the total deductions from her paycheck to find the amount she has left to spend:

$2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment."
"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving subtraction and division. To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the number of pencils present in the box.

Given that the box has a capacity for 20 pencils and 4 pencils are missing, we can calculate the number of pencils in the box by subtracting the missing pencils from the total capacity.

20 - 4 = 16

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils in the box. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 ÷ 2 = 8

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 × 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4:
300 × 0.4 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 × 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display:
120 + 15 = 135

The final answer is: 135"
"To determine the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks bought and then multiply it by the cost per item.

First, let's find the total number of people: Aiden and his 12 friends, plus 7 more friends, equals 19 people.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 19 * 2 (drinks) + 19 * 3 (snacks) = 38 drinks + 57 snacks = 95 items.

The cost per item is $2. So, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 95 items * $2 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as H, and Gary's truck as Y.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. G = 4,000 (Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel)
2. H = G + 800 (Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck)
3. G + H + Y = 11,600 (The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds)

We can substitute the value of G from equation 1 into equation 2 to get H in terms of G:
H = 4,000 + 800
H = 4,800

Now, we can substitute the values of G and H into equation 3 to solve for Y:
4,000 + 4,800 + Y = 11,600

Combine like terms:
8,800 + Y = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides:
Y = 11,600 - 8,800
Y = 2,800

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step using algebraic equations.

Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as F and the number of dumplings each male ate as M. We know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so we can write an equation:

M = F + 1

We are also given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so F = 3.

Now, let's find the number of dumplings each male ate. Since M = F + 1 and F = 3, we can substitute F into the equation:

M = 3 + 1
M = 4

Now, let's find the total number of dumplings eaten by females. There are 6 females, and each ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is:

6F = 6(3) = 18

Similarly, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:

6M = 6(4) = 24

Since there are 14 people in total, the total number of dumplings eaten is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females:

Total dumplings = 18 (by females) + 24 (by males) = 42

However, we are told that there were no leftovers, which means the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten. Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"When dividing a sum in a given ratio, we first need to determine the total parts and the individual's share. In this case, the ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

To find Gerald's initial amount, we can use the formula: (Gerald's share / Total parts) * Total sum. In this case, Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, and the total sum is $100.

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = $60

Now, we need to subtract the amount Gerald spent on a book, which is $10, to find out how much money he has left.

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = $50

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left after spending $10 on a book.

The final answer is: $50"
"Given the problem, we can establish a ratio between the cat's speed and the turtle's speed. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can express this as a ratio of 5:1.

Let's denote the speed of the turtle as x. Then, the speed of the cat is 5x. We are given that the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 15

To find the speed of the turtle, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 15 / 5
x = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can find the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we must first calculate the amount they need to raise per hour. 

Let's denote the total amount raised in the first 3 hours as $2100. To find the amount raised per hour, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: 

$$\frac{2100}{3} = 700$$

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: 

$$\frac{4200}{700} = 6$$

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 

$$3 + 6 = 9$$

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"When analyzing the water usage of Colorado City, it's essential to break down the percentages to understand the distribution of water usage. The city utilizes 40% of the Colorado River's water, and within that, 80% is allocated for industrial purposes.

To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we need to calculate the percentage used for industrial purposes first. This can be done by multiplying the percentage of water used by the city (40%) by the percentage allocated for industrial purposes (80%): 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 8%.

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"As a multiplication expert, I can confidently calculate the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring. 

To find the total amount, we need to multiply the number of days in 2 weeks by the daily charge. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks will have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Now, we multiply the number of days by the daily charge: 14 days * $12/day = $168.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the production rate of chocolate ice cream as C (in quarts per hour) and the production rate of vanilla ice cream as V (in quarts per hour).

We know that the factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so we can write the equation:

2C = 100

We also know that the factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so we can write the equation:

4V = 50

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to find the total production rate of both types of ice cream and then multiply it by 48.

First, let's solve the first equation for C:

C = 100 / 2
C = 50

Now, let's solve the second equation for V:

V = 50 / 4
V = 12.5

Now that we have the production rates for both types of ice cream, we can find the total production rate:

Total production rate = C + V
Total production rate = 50 + 12.5
Total production rate = 62.5

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we multiply the total production rate by 48:

Total quarts = 62.5 * 48
Total quarts = 3000

The final answer is: 3000"
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to multiply the quantities of each item by their respective prices and then add the results together. Afterward, we'll apply the 10% discount to the total.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- Croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we'll apply the 10% discount to the total. To do this, we multiply the total by 0.10 (which is equivalent to 10%): $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to consider the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal is a ratio of 2:1, where 2 scoops are purchased and 1 scoop is free. 

Let's denote the cost of each scoop as $1.50. The total budget Erin has is $6.00. 

To maximize the number of scoops, we should first calculate the cost of 2 scoops, which is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. This leaves Erin with $6.00 - $3.00 = $3.00 remaining.

Since Erin can get 1 free scoop for every 2 scoops purchased, we can buy 2 more scoops with the remaining $3.00, making it a total of 3 scoops for the price of 4 scoops.

However, we can further optimize this by considering the ratio of the deal. If we buy 4 scoops, the total cost would be 4 * $1.50 = $6.00, which is exactly Erin's budget. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream to maximize the number of scoops she can get.

The final answer is: 4"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the difference in the number of candies between Ginger and Amy after two weeks. To approach this, we need to calculate the total candies each consumes in two weeks and then subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she consumes 4 × 14 = 56 pieces. This can be expressed as 4 × (2 × 7) = 4 × 2 × 7 = 56.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she consumes 3 × 14 = 42 pieces. This can be expressed as 3 × (2 × 7) = 3 × 2 × 7 = 42.

Now, let's calculate the remaining candies for each. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and consumes 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and consumes 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find the difference in the number of candies between Amy and Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candies from Amy's remaining candies: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final numerical answer is: 14"

The area to be covered is two thirds of 36 sq ft, which can be calculated as:

(2/3) * 36

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number and keep the denominator the same:

(2 * 36) / 3

This simplifies to:

72 / 3

To divide 72 by 3, we can use long division or simply divide the numbers:

72 ÷ 3 = 24

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft.

For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need:

24 * 24 = 576

The final answer is: 576"
"To determine the cost savings of picking blueberries, we need to calculate the total cost of picking and compare it to the cost of buying at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is comprised of an initial fee of $20 and a variable cost of $1.5 per pound. Given that James picked 30 pounds of blueberries, the total cost of picking is $20 + $1.5 * 30 = $20 + $45 = $65.

On the other hand, the cost of buying blueberries at the store is a fixed price of $2.5 per pound. Therefore, the total cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store is $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find the cost savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"When calculating the total amount of money a company paid for computers, it's essential to consider the price increase. In this scenario, the original price per computer was $700, but the company encountered a 10% price hike.

To find the new price, I'll calculate the price increase: 10% of $700 is 0.1 x 700 = $70. Adding this to the original price gives us the new price per computer: $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, to determine the total amount paid for 500 computers, I'll multiply the new price per computer by the total number of computers: 500 x $770 = $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"The art of calculating the caloric content of a dish.  A task that requires precision and a deep understanding of multiplication and addition.  As an expert in these mathematical operations, I can assure you that the process is quite straightforward.

First, let's calculate the total calories from the eggs.  We have 6 eggs, each with 75 calories.  To find the total calories from the eggs, we multiply the number of eggs by the calories per egg:

6 eggs × 75 calories/egg = 6 × 75 = 450 calories

Next, we calculate the total calories from the cheese and ham.  We have 2 oz of each, with the cheese containing 120 calories per oz and the ham containing 40 calories per oz.  To find the total calories from the cheese and ham, we multiply the number of oz by the calories per oz for each ingredient and then add the results:

2 oz × 120 calories/oz = 2 × 120 = 240 calories (cheese)
2 oz × 40 calories/oz = 2 × 40 = 80 calories (ham)
Total calories from cheese and ham = 240 + 80 = 320 calories

Now, we add the total calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to find the total calories in the omelet:

Total calories = 450 (eggs) + 320 (cheese and ham) = 770 calories

The final answer is: 770"
"The total cost of the pencils and erasers can be calculated by multiplying the cost of each item by the number of items purchased and then adding the two amounts together.

Cost of pencils: 6 pencils * $0.50 = $3
Cost of erasers: 8 erasers * $0.25 = $2

Total cost: $3 + $2 = $5

Since you paid $10, the change would be: $10 - $5 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To determine the number of people who accept the position, we need to apply the given percentages sequentially.

First, we calculate the number of people who receive interviews, which is 30% of the total applicants. This can be expressed as:

30% of 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30

Next, we find the number of people who receive a job offer, which is 20% of those who received interviews:

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6

Finally, we calculate the number of people who accept the position, which is one-third of those who received a job offer:

1/3 of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount of rice given away, we need to calculate the total number of sacks given away and then multiply it by the weight of each sack.

First, let's find the total number of sacks given away. Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 

Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Now, we need to multiply the total sacks given away by the weight of each sack, which is 25 kilograms.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 7 × 25 = 175 kilograms

Therefore, the total amount of rice given away is 175 kilograms."
"As an expert in arithmetic operations, I can confidently calculate the difference in the number of cereal boxes Castle bought this week and last week.

To find the difference, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week. This week, Castle purchased a total of 3 + 5 = 8 boxes of cereal.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, let's perform the subtraction: 8 - 4 = 4.

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the total number of taps for each scenario and then add them together.

Let's break it down:

Scenario 1: Arms down
- Rate of right foot taps per minute: 300
- Rate of left foot taps per minute: 250
- Total rate of taps per minute: 300 + 250 = 550
- Total taps for 3 minutes: 550 * 3 = 1650

Scenario 2: Arms up
- Rate of right foot taps per minute: 200
- Rate of left foot taps per minute: 200
- Total rate of taps per minute: 200 + 200 = 400
- Total taps for 2 minutes: 400 * 2 = 800

Total taps = 1650 + 800 = 2450

The final answer is: 2450"
"The scenario involves calculating the cost-benefit analysis of fixing a pothole. To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to consider the total damage it will cause to his car and the costs associated with fixing it.

The total damage to his car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 × $25 = $75.

To find the total cost of fixing the pothole, we add the fine and the cost of asphalt: $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the total damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"Subtraction is my domain, and I'm delighted to tackle this problem. To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

Let's break it down:

Total normal chairs = 170
Total baby chairs = 23

Total chairs sent for repair = 20 (normal) + 13 (baby) = 33

To find the total number of chairs left, we'll subtract the total chairs sent for repair from the sum of the total normal and baby chairs. However, since we're subtracting a positive value, we can also think of it as adding the negative of the total chairs sent for repair.

Total chairs left = (Total normal chairs + Total baby chairs) - Total chairs sent for repair
Total chairs left = (170 + 23) - 33
Total chairs left = 193 - 33
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by determining the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends who ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 3 people as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Next, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas. We can calculate the number of slices eaten by each of these friends as follows:

2 friends * 3/4 * 12 slices/friend = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people by adding the number of slices eaten by the first 3 people and the remaining 2 people:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of pizzas ordered is:

60 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 5 pizzas

Now, we can find the total number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

However, we know that the two friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas each ate 9 slices. So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is 18 slices, which is equal to 1.5 pizzas (9 slices/pizza). Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices left is:

5 pizzas - 1.5 pizzas = 3.5 pizzas
3.5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 42 slices

However, we already know that the total number of slices eaten is 42 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices left is:

42 slices - 42 slices = 0 slices

However, this is not possible since we know that 2 slices were left. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each. So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is 18 slices. We also know that Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which is 24 slices. The total number of slices eaten is 42 slices.

"To calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we need to first determine the time taken by the dog. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can find this by multiplying the time taken by the cat by 2/3.

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) × 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog by taking the harmonic mean of their times, which is the most suitable average for this scenario since we are dealing with rates (time taken to eat sausages).

Average time = 2 / ((1/30) + (1/20))
Average time = 2 / ((20 + 30) / 600)
Average time = 2 / (50 / 600)
Average time = 2 × 600 / 50
Average time = 1200 / 50
Average time = 24 minutes

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve for the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 90 / 9

x = 10

"To calculate the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to determine the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars:
- Number of students' cars: 64
- Number of windows per car: 4
- Fraction of windows smashed: 1/4
- Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) × (64 × 4) = (1/4) × 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
- Number of teachers' cars: 32
- Number of windows per car: 2
- Fraction of windows smashed: 3/4
- Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) × (32 × 2) = (3/4) × 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:
Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"To determine the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to calculate the proportion of blue spools out of the total number of spools.

First, let's identify the total number of blue spools. This is the sum of the light blue and dark blue spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. This is the sum of all the spools, including light blue, dark blue, light green, and dark green.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the correct answer is 40%."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, let's find the number of people who voted by midday. We know that 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by then. 

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find the number of people who voted by 16:00. We know that 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by then. The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

Total consumption = 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 4 * 30 = 120 pieces

Next, we need to divide the total consumption by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs Parker will need.

Number of pieces in a pack: 15 pieces

Number of packs needed = Total consumption / Number of pieces in a pack
= 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack
= 8 packs

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we must first calculate the total number of smores required. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 × 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 × 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 ÷ 8 = 3.
Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes needed is 3 ÷ 3 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Given the problem, we can model it as a system of linear equations. Let's denote Dora's age as D, her father's age as F, and her mother's age as M.

We are given the following information:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age: F = 2D + 8
2. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father: M = F - 4
3. Dora is 15 years old: D = 15

We can substitute the value of D into the first equation to find F:
F = 2D + 8
F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now, we can substitute the value of F into the second equation to find M:
M = F - 4
M = 38 - 4
M = 34

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can add their ages:
Total combined age = D + F + M
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87

The final answer is: 87"
"When dividing a quantity into equal parts, we use the concept of division. In this scenario, we have a total amount of $20 that needs to be split equally among 3 siblings. To find the amount each sibling receives, we perform the division operation.

The mathematical expression for this problem is:

$20 ÷ 3 = ?

To solve this, we can use long division or a calculator. However, in this case, we can also use the concept of division as the inverse operation of multiplication. We can ask ourselves, ""What number multiplied by 3 equals 20?""

Using this approach, we find that 20 ÷ 3 = 6.67 (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, each of Greg's siblings will receive $6.67."
"To determine the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the combined weight of her math, science, French, English, and history books.

First, let's consider the weights of the math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds, we can express their combined weight as 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.

Next, we have the weights of the French and English books. The French book weighs 4 pounds, and the English book weighs 3 pounds. Their combined weight is 4 + 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we need to find the weight of the history book, which is twice as heavy as the English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

To find the total weight of all the books, we add the weights of the math and science books, the French and English books, and the history book: 4 + 7 + 6 = 17 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of votes candidate C received in the student council election. 

First, let's find the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, which is 20 + 0.5 * 20 = 30 votes.

Now, we know that candidate A and B together received 20 + 30 = 50 votes. To find the number of votes candidate C received, we subtract the total votes received by A and B from the total number of voters, which is 100. 

So, candidate C received 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"The art of subtraction. A fundamental operation in mathematics, yet often overlooked in its complexity. In this scenario, we have two individuals, Boris and Beck, with an initial difference in apple possession. Boris starts with 100 apples, while Beck has 23 fewer, which equates to 77 apples.

When Boris donates 10 apples to Beck, the difference in their apple count becomes apparent. Beck's new total is 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Meanwhile, Boris's count decreases to 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

Now, to determine the difference in their apple counts, we apply the fundamental principle of subtraction: the difference between two quantities is the result of subtracting the smaller quantity from the larger one. In this case, we subtract Beck's new total from Boris's new total: 90 - 87.

The calculation yields 3, indicating that Beck now has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for giant cubes: 3 × 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, we'll calculate the total amount of water used for medium cubes: 7 × 2 = 14 ounces.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water used for small cubes: 8 × 0.5 = 4 ounces.

To find the total amount of water used, we add the amounts used for each type of cube: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as S, the number of books Alice has as A, and the number of books Clara has as C.

From the given information, we can write the following equations:

1. A = S + 6 (Alice has 6 more books than Steven)
2. C = 2S (Clara has two times as many books as Steven)
3. C = 20 (Clara has 20 books)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2 to find the value of S:
2S = 20
S = 20 / 2
S = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has by substituting S into equation 1:
A = S + 6
A = 10 + 6
A = 16

Now, let's find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:
C - A = 20 - 16
C - A = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"As an expert in addition, subtraction, and multiplication, I can confidently calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 × $5 = $50
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 × $3 = $48

To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48 = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"Given a class of 50 students with diverse hobbies, we can apply set theory principles to solve this problem. Let's denote the sets as follows:

- B: Students who like to bake
- G: Students who like to play video games
- M: Students who like to play music
- Bb: Students who like to play basketball

We are given the following information:

- |B| = 10 (number of students who like to bake)
- |Bb| = 5 (number of students who like to play basketball)
- |M| = 2|Bb| (number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball)

We are also given that the total number of students is 50, and we need to find the number of students who like to play video games.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can express the total number of students as the sum of the number of students in each set minus the sum of the intersections between sets, plus the number of students in the intersection of all sets. However, in this case, we don't have any information about the intersections between sets, so we can simplify the problem.

Since the total number of students is 50, and we know the number of students who like to bake and play basketball, we can find the number of students who like to play video games or music:

|G ∪ M| = |B ∪ Bb ∪ G ∪ M| - |B| - |Bb|
= 50 - 10 - 5
= 35

We also know that |M| = 2|Bb| = 2(5) = 10. Since |G ∪ M| = |G| + |M| - |G ∩ M|, and we don't have any information about the intersection of G and M, we can assume that |G ∩ M| = 0 for the sake of this problem.

Therefore, |G| = |G ∪ M| - |M|
= 35 - 10
= 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds, which is 12.

1/3 of 12 can be calculated as a fraction: 12/3 = 4

Alternatively, we can also express 1/3 as a decimal and multiply it by 12: 0.33 * 12 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away.

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 12 - 4 = 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. We can add 20 to the remaining number of birds: 8 + 20 = 28

Therefore, the final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"Given that two classes have a total of 80 students, with each class having an equal number of students, we can denote the number of students in each class as x. Therefore, we have the equation 2x = 80, where x represents the number of students in each class.

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40 students per class.

Now, we are told that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can express this as a proportion: 40% of x = 0.4x. Substituting x = 40, we get 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls per class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class: 40 - 16 = 24 boys per class.

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To solve this multi-step arithmetic word problem, we need to carefully follow the sequence of events.

"To calculate the profit made by Mark, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue from the packs of old magic cards.

The total cost is the cost of the packs: 3 packs * $1800 = $5400.

The total revenue is the sum of the value of the cards: 
- 1 card worth $4000
- 1 card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth an average of $50 each: 30 * $50 = $1500
Total revenue = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"When comparing the costs of two amusement parks, it's essential to consider the fees for both adults and children. In this scenario, we have two adults and two children in the family. Let's break down the costs for each amusement park.

For the first amusement park, the cost for adults is calculated as 2 adults * $26 = $52, and the cost for children is 2 children * $12 = $24. Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park, the cost for adults is 2 adults * $14 = $28, and the cost for children is 2 children * $10 = $20. Consequently, the total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To determine the savings, we need to find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks. This can be calculated as $76 (first amusement park) - $48 (second amusement park) = $28.

"The art of subtraction and multiplication - my areas of expertise. In this case, we're dealing with a simple yet effective scenario where a vendor switches suppliers to save money.

To calculate the daily savings, we need to subtract the new cost from the old cost, then multiply the result by the number of tomatoes sold.

Daily savings = (500 * 0.5) - (500 * 0.4)
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

Now, to find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7.

Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

"Given the scenario, we have a classic example of a proportionality problem. Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, the number of marbles Carl has as C, and the number of marbles Cal has as Ca.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, which can be expressed as S = Ca/2. Substituting the value of S, we get 56 = Ca/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we find Ca = 112.

Furthermore, we are told that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, which can be expressed as C = 4S. Substituting the value of S, we get C = 4 * 56 = 224.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: C + Ca = 224 + 112 = 336.

"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we first need to find the total number of students required for 12 groups. 

Since each group requires 9 students, we can calculate the total number of students required by multiplying the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students required = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Now, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups. Since we already have 54 students, we can calculate the additional students required by subtracting the available students from the total students required.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To find the number of additional groups required, we can divide the additional students required by the students per group.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and apply the given ratios and percentages.

First, let's determine the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading her small stickers. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them for large buttons. This can be calculated as follows:

90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Next, we need to find out how many small buttons she gets from trading her large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and the rest for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading 50% of her large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the number of small buttons she gets from trading the remaining large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has. She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the number of students for each size.

First, we know that 11 students need extra-small shirts. Since twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, we can calculate the number of small shirts needed as 2 * 11 = 22.

Next, we're told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium shirts. So, the number of medium shirts needed is 22 - 4 = 18.

Moving on, we find that half as many students need large shirts as size medium. Therefore, the number of large shirts needed is 18 / 2 = 9.

Finally, we're informed that six more students need extra-large shirts than large. Thus, the number of extra-large shirts needed is 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together to find the total number of shirts ordered:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The total number of shirts ordered is 75."

"Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians and one third of the Pomeranians are girls, with 6 Pomeranian girls, we can establish a proportion to solve for the total number of puppies.

Let's denote the total number of puppies as P. Since two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, we can express this as:

(2/3)P = Number of Pomeranians

We are given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and this number is 6. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians can be expressed as:

(1/3) * Number of Pomeranians = 6
Number of Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Number of Pomeranians = 18

Now, we can substitute this value into the first equation:

(2/3)P = 18

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

P = 18 * (3/2)
P = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

"When dealing with ratios and proportions, it's essential to break down the problem into manageable parts. In this scenario, we have three houses with different shingle requirements. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x.

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, we can express this as a ratio: 1/2 : x. To find the number of cases for the first house, we multiply x by 1/2, which gives us x/2.

The third house needs double the first, so we can express this as a ratio: 2 : x/2. To find the number of cases for the third house, we multiply x/2 by 2, which gives us x.

Now, we know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"

First, we need to find the total kilograms of oranges needed. Since Sam requires 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total amount needed for 4 liters: 5 kg/liter * 4 liters = 20 kg.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so we multiply the total kilograms by the cost per kilogram: 20 kg * $3/kg = $60.

Therefore, the total cost for Sam to make 4 liters of juice is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to determine the number of books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can express this relationship as:

Let A be the number of books Ahmed read. Then, 2A is the number of books Ezra read.

We know that Ezra read 300 books, so we can set up the equation:

2A = 300

To solve for A, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

A = 300 / 2
A = 150

Now that we know Ahmed read 150 books, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so Ezra will read a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books.

The total number of books read by both is the sum of the books read by Ahmed and Ezra:

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her compensation into two components: hourly wages and daily bonuses.

For hourly wages, we calculate the total hours worked and multiply it by the hourly rate. On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, so her hourly earnings are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, so her hourly earnings are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Next, we need to determine if she earns a daily bonus. The bonus is $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. On Monday, she teaches 4 classes, so she earns the daily bonus of $5. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, so she does not earn the daily bonus.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for each day. On Monday, her total earnings are $75 (hourly wages) + $5 (daily bonus) = $80. On Wednesday, her total earnings are $30 (hourly wages) + $0 (daily bonus) = $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for each day: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"As a subtraction expert, I can confidently calculate the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

To find the total number of vanilla scents sold, we multiply the number of vanilla scents sold per day (5) by the total number of vanilla scents available (4). This gives us 5 × 4 = 20 vanilla scents sold.

Next, we calculate the total number of fruity scents sold by multiplying the number of fruity scents sold per day (2) by the total number of fruity scents available (8). This gives us 2 × 8 = 16 fruity scents sold.

Now, to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold, we perform the subtraction operation: 20 - 16.

20 - 16 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a linear equation representing Bennet's total earnings from selling eggplants and corn. Let's denote the price of each ear of corn as x.

The total earnings from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each is 20 * 3 = $60. Bennet wants to make a total of $135, so the earnings from selling the corn should be $135 - $60 = $75.

We can represent the total earnings from selling the corn as 25x, where x is the price of each ear of corn. Therefore, we have the equation:

25x = 75

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 25:

x = 75 / 25

x = 3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we need to calculate the time she dedicates to this activity. 

First, let's calculate the total time available for her weekend: 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, totaling 12 hours.

Next, we'll subtract the time she spends reading, which is 3 hours, from the total time available to find the remaining time: 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends playing video games, which is 1/3 of the remaining time: 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

To find the time spent playing soccer, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time available: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 50%."
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we need to perform a series of fraction operations.

First, Anthony gave 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon. This can be calculated as:

50 - (1/2 * 50) = 50 - 25 = 25

So, Anthony has 25 pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3/5:

(3/5) * 25 = (3 * 25) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 mph. Using the formula for time, which is time = distance / rate, we can calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours
Time to drive back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

The total time spent driving is the sum of the time to drive to the museum and the time to drive back home: 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Now, we need to add the time Jack spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left after assembling the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles, and then subtract this total from the initial number of wheels in the box.

First, let's calculate the number of wheels needed for the cars. We have 57 cars, and each car requires 4 wheels. This can be calculated as follows:

57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels

Next, we'll calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles. We have 73 motorcycles, and each motorcycle requires 2 wheels. This can be calculated as follows:

73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we'll add the number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:

228 wheels (cars) + 146 wheels (motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Finally, we'll subtract the total number of wheels required from the initial number of wheels in the box to find the number of wheels left:

650 wheels (initial) - 374 wheels (required) = 276 wheels

The final answer is: $\boxed{276}$"
"When calculating discounts, it's essential to understand the concept of percentage reduction. In this case, we're dealing with a 20% discount on a laptop priced at $1000. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (20% or 0.20).

Discount amount = $1000 × 0.20 = $200

Now, to determine the final price, we subtract the discount amount from the original price.

Final price = Original price - Discount amount
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

Therefore, the final price after the 20% discount is $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, which can be expressed as a fraction: $\frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200$ movies.

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is $6 \times 200 = $1200.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies: $600 - 200 = 400$ movies.

Now, we need to find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which can be expressed as a decimal: $0.4 \times 400 = 160$ older movies.

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is $5 \times 160 = $800.

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies: $400 - 160 = 240$ normal movies.

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost of the normal movies is $10 \times 240 = $2400.

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

The final answer is: $4400"
"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving multiplication and addition. To calculate the total cost of the fruits Winston picked, we need to multiply the weight of each fruit by its respective price per pound and then add the results together.

- Cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = 8 × 1 = $8.00
- Cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = 6 × 3 = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together to find the total amount spent:

$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"Given the scenario, we have a classic problem involving rates and time. Let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the driving speed as $d$ and the hiking speed as $h$. We know that the Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. Therefore, we have $d = 50$.

We are also given that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. This can be expressed as $h = \frac{1}{2}d - 5$. Substituting the value of $d$, we get $h = \frac{1}{2}(50) - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20$ miles per hour.

The total time spent driving and hiking is 6 hours, and the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours. We can set up the equation for the total time as $\frac{d}{50} + \frac{h}{20} = 6$. Substituting the values of $d$ and $h$, we get $\frac{50}{50} + \frac{20}{20} = 6$, which simplifies to $1 + 1 = 6$. However, this is not the correct equation to use.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote Emma's score as E, Ava's score as A, and the number of seconds Emma finishes the level in as t.

We know that Emma's score is the sum of points from enemies, berries, and the timer. Since she receives 10 points for every enemy she jumps on, 5 points for each berry she collects, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when she finishes the level, we can write her score as:

E = 10e + 5b + 30(t - 0)

where e is the number of enemies Emma jumps on, b is the number of berries she collects, and t is the time she finishes the level in seconds.

Ava's score is also the sum of points from enemies, berries, and the timer. Since she jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, collects 3 more berries than Emma, and finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, we can write her score as:

A = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t + 4)

Simplifying the equation for Ava's score, we get:

A = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t + 120
A = 10e + 5b + 30t + 195

Now, we can set up an equation to find the difference between their scores:

A - E = (10e + 5b + 30t + 195) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
A - E = 195

Since we want to find the difference in their scores, we can simplify the equation to:

A - E = 195

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"The problem at hand involves subtracting the cost of two known pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. This is a straightforward application of the subtraction operation.

Let's denote the total cost of all four pizzas as $T$, the cost of the two known pizzas as $K$, and the cost of each of the other two pizzas as $x$. We are given that $T = 64$ and $K = 2 \times 30 = 60$. 

To find the total cost of the other two pizzas, we subtract the cost of the known pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas:

$T - K = 64 - 60 = 4$

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can express their total cost as $2x$. Therefore, we have the equation:

$2x = 4$

To find the value of $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$x = \frac{4}{2} = 2$

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs $\boxed{2}$ dollars."
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be represented as 3 * 5, which is a simple multiplication problem. Multiplying 3 by 5 gives us 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days. This is a simple addition problem: 15 + 12.

15 + 12 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O.

We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we can write the equation:

W + O = 17  ... (Equation 1)

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. Therefore, we can write the equation:

3 + O = 2(4 + W)  ... (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve Equation 2 for O:

O = 2(4 + W) - 3
O = 8 + 2W - 3
O = 5 + 2W

Substitute this expression for O into Equation 1:

W + (5 + 2W) = 17

Combine like terms:

3W + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3W = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

W = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption and cost of Andy's car, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the car's fuel efficiency.

Given that the one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week using the car's fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG): 

Fuel consumption (gallons) = Total distance (miles) / Fuel efficiency (MPG)
Fuel consumption (gallons) = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Next, we can calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the fuel consumption by the price of gas, which is $3 per gallon:

Total cost per week = Fuel consumption (gallons) * Price per gallon
Total cost per week = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

Therefore, the weekly fuel consumption and cost of Andy's car is $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Since she has 140 quarters, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter: 140 × $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3/5, which is equivalent to multiplying 10 by 3 and then dividing by 5: (10 × 3) ÷ 5 = 30 ÷ 5 = $6. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of the twenties she spent is $6 × $20 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of fruits obtained from tomato and eggplant plants. To approach this, we need to apply the principles of multiplication and addition.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes. We have 5 tomato plants, and each plant yields 22 tomatoes. Using the multiplication operation, we can find the total number of tomatoes as follows:

5 × 22 = 110

Next, we'll calculate the total number of eggplants. We have 8 eggplant plants, and each plant yields 4 eggplants. Using the multiplication operation again, we can find the total number of eggplants as follows:

8 × 4 = 32

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we need to add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together:

110 + 32 = 142

Therefore, Ricardo can obtain a total of 142 fruits from his plants.

The final answer is: 142"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of OLED TVs sold. We know that one-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. 

Let's start by finding the total number of TVs that are not OLED. We can do this by adding the fractions of smart TVs and analog TVs. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8. 

One-fourth can be written as 2/8, and one-eighth is already in the correct form. So, the total number of smart TVs and analog TVs is 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8.

Now, we can find the fraction of OLED TVs by subtracting 3/8 from 1 (since the total fraction must add up to 1). To do this, we need to find the equivalent fraction for 1 with a denominator of 8, which is 8/8. 

Now we can subtract: 8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8.

This means that 5/8 of the total TVs are OLED. To find the number of OLED TVs, we multiply 5/8 by the total number of TVs, which is 40.

5/8 * 40 = (5 * 40) / 8 = 200 / 8 = 25.

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"As a subtraction expert, I can confidently calculate the amount John is missing to cover the remaining cost of the trip. 

To find the amount John is missing, we need to determine the total cost of the trip and subtract the amount the school will cover. The total cost of the trip is $300, and the school will cover half of this amount. 

Half of the trip cost = 300 / 2 = $150

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the amount the school will cover to find the amount he is missing:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to determine the temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature. The freezing point is 32 degrees, and the night temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

The temperature difference is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we need to determine the number of groups formed from the 90 participants. Since each group consists of 9 people, we can use division to find the number of groups:

Number of groups = Total number of participants ÷ Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 ÷ 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. The problem states that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find this number, we can multiply the total number of groups by the fraction:

Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups × (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 × (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Each group that brought back seashells contributed 2 seashells. Therefore, we can multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group:

Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells × Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 × 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of people on the train, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we start with the initial number of people on the train, which is 172. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:

172 - 47 = 125

Next, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:

125 + 13 = 138

Then, at the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:

138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, the number of people on the train is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"The art of multiplication. It's a fundamental operation that underlies so many aspects of our daily lives, including finance and economics. In this case, we're dealing with a simple yet effective currency system based on bottle caps.

To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to perform a straightforward multiplication operation. The number of bottle caps he finds per day is 10, and each cap is worth $0.25. We can represent this as a multiplication problem:

10 × 0.25 = ?

To solve this, we can multiply the numbers together:

10 × 0.25 = 2.50

Now, we need to multiply this daily amount by the number of days in the month, which is 30:

2.50 × 30 = 75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"As an expert in calculating overtime pay, I can confidently determine Jamie's total earnings for the day.

To calculate her total earnings, we need to consider her regular hourly rate and the overtime rate. Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour, and she worked 8 hours at this rate. The overtime rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour.

For the regular 8 hours, her earnings are 8 * $20 = $160. For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at the overtime rate of $30 per hour, so her earnings for the overtime hours are 3 * $30 = $90.

To find her total earnings, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings: $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the sum of the female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

First, we have 12 female lions. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, which can be calculated as 12 ÷ 2 = 6. 

Next, we have 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs: 12 + 6 + 14.

12 + 6 = 18

"When it comes to calculating discounts and determining the amount of money left over after a purchase, I always rely on the fundamental principles of percentage calculations and basic arithmetic operations.

Given that the original price of the jeans is $40 and they are advertised at a 25% discount, I can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount = 25% of $40
Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, to find the price after the discount, I'll subtract the discount amount from the original price:

Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill, I'll perform a simple subtraction:

Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to consider the linear growth of the workforce and the fixed monthly salary per employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. This represents a constant rate of growth, which can be modeled as an arithmetic sequence. The total number of employees after 3 months can be calculated as:

200 + 20(3) = 200 + 60 = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee, which is $4000. Therefore, the total monthly salary is:

Total monthly salary = 200 * $4000 = $800,000

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:

Total amount paid = $800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"As an expert in addition and multiplication, I can confidently calculate the total time the choir will be caroling.

To find the total time, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

The time for ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds, and we need to multiply this by 2 to account for singing it twice: 2 × 150 = 300 seconds.

The time for ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds.

Now, we simply add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" (sung twice) to the time for ""Jingle Bells"": 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the total caroling time is 540 seconds.

"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he receives a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Following another year, he receives a raise of $1.00 per hour, resulting in a final hourly wage of $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"The task at hand is a straightforward application of multiplication and addition principles. To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by students. We have 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. Multiplying these values gives us the total number of students:

40 classes × 25 students/class = 40 × 25 = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is:

1000 students × 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. Multiplying these values gives us the total number of teachers:

40 classes × 3 teachers/class = 40 × 3 = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is:

120 teachers × 2 trees/teacher = 120 × 2 = 240 trees

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted:

1000 trees (students) + 240 trees (teachers) = 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to determine the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate 30% of that total.

The total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has is 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14.

To find 30% of 14, we multiply 14 by 0.3:

14 * 0.3 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more.

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

However, this equation is not necessary. We can simply divide 30 by 0.3 to find the total number of stuffed animals needed to make the percentage 30%:

30 / 0.3 = 100

Since Bubbles already has 14 stuffed animals, we need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to reach a total of 100 stuffed animals:

100 - 14 = 86

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the target hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for half an hour every day. This can be expressed as 14 * 0.5 hours. 

14 * 0.5 hours = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, and she plays for 2 hours every day. This can be expressed as 7 * 2 hours.

7 * 2 hours = 14 hours

Now, we add the hours Kris played in 2 weeks and 1 week to find the total hours she has played.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours
Total hours played = 21 hours

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours.

Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours
Hours still needed = 9 hours

The final answer is: 9"
"When analyzing the relative motion of two objects, it's essential to consider the concept of relative speed. In this scenario, we have two cars moving at different speeds on a straight highway. The first car is traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, while the second car is moving at a speed of 70 miles per hour.

To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. The relative speed is the difference between the speeds of the two cars, which is 70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph.

Now, we can use the formula for distance, which is distance = speed × time. Since we're interested in the distance between the two cars, we'll use the relative speed and the time of 2 hours.

Distance = relative speed × time
= 10 mph × 2 hours
= 20 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then apply the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

To calculate the premium, we need to find 30% of $900. This can be done by multiplying $900 by 0.3, which is equivalent to 30/100. The calculation is:

$900 × 0.3 = $900 × (30/100) = $900 × 30/100 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold to get the final amount James paid:

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid a total of $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80 out of 400.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to calculate the total number of square inches Milo can create with the glass chips. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips as follows:

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips per bag
Total chips = 2 * 72
Total chips = 144 chips

Now, we can find the total number of square inches Milo can create with the glass chips by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips required to make one square inch:

Total square inches = Total chips / chips per square inch
Total square inches = 144 / 12
Total square inches = 12

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total number of square inches by the height:

Length = Total square inches / height
Length = 12 / 3
Length = 4

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add it to the remaining tea.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students who drank 1.5 quarts each: 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.

Next, we'll calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students who drank 2 quarts each: 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.

Now, we'll add the amounts of tea consumed by both groups: 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the remaining tea from quarts to gallons: 10 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 2.5 gallons.

To find the initial amount of tea at the party, we'll add the total amount of tea consumed to the remaining tea: 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts. Then, we'll convert this amount from quarts to gallons: 48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies. Then, he sold 150 candies. To find out how many candies he has left, we need to subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies. However, since he sold more candies than he initially had, we need to consider the additional candies he ordered.

Let's calculate the number of candies he has left: 100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50. Since we can't have a negative number of candies, this means he must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold.

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. Now, we need to add these additional candies to the initial number of candies: 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200.

Now, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies: 200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"The problem at hand involves exponential growth, a fundamental concept in mathematics that describes the rapid increase in the value of a quantity over a specific period. In this scenario, the number of students on campus doubles every month, which is a classic example of exponential growth.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential growth: A = P(2^n), where A is the final amount, P is the initial amount, and n is the number of periods (in this case, months).

Given that there are 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can calculate the number of students at the end of May as follows:

A = 10(2^4) = 10(16) = 160

Now, to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the final number of students:

Additional students = 160 - 10 = 150

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Let's start by dividing the total money made by the cost per branch:

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made ÷ Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 ÷ $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. To do this, we'll divide the total number of branches climbed by the number of days:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed ÷ Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 ÷ 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"The task at hand is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving the calculation of total petals from various sets of flowers and then subtracting the petals that were lost. To approach this problem, I will first calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then perform the subtraction.

Let's start by calculating the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

1. For the 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 × 5 = 15 petals
2. For the 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 × 6 = 24 petals
3. For the 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 × 4 = 20 petals
4. For the 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 × 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals from all sets: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Next, we need to subtract the petals that were lost due to Rose dropping 1 petal from each set of flowers: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is 97.

The final answer is: 97"
"The problem at hand involves a straightforward calculation of remaining marshmallows and subsequent division to determine the number of S'mores each kid can have. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. This can be done by adding the number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean, and then adding the number of marshmallows dropped.

Total marshmallows used by John = 9
Total marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Now, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag to find the remaining marshmallows.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Next, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to determine the number of S'mores each kid can have.

Number of kids = 2
S'mores each kid can have = 14 ÷ 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Given the scenario, we have four individuals playing a game at different rates. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, while two of his friends can play for half the time, and the other friend can play for 1.5 times the time.

Let's break down the time played by each individual:

- Jack: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Two friends (worse than Jack): 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each
- Friend (better than Jack): 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes

The total time played is the sum of their individual times: 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the cost per minute. Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

To find the total amount of money used, we multiply the total time played by the cost per minute: 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Given the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the ingredients. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x, the amount of salt (and sugar) as y, and the amount of oil as z.

We know that the total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:

x + x + y + y + z = 10

Combine like terms:

2x + 2y + z = 10

We also know that the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so we can write the equation:

z = 2y

We also know that the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so we can write the equation:

y = 2x

Substitute the expression for y into the first equation:

2x + 2(2x) + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

2x + 4x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

8x = 10

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 10/8

x = 1.25

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

y = 2x
y = 2(1.25)
y = 2.5

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of z:

z = 2y
z = 2(2.5)
z = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"The art of arithmetic operations.  Multiplication and addition are fundamental building blocks of mathematics, and I'm delighted to apply my expertise to this problem.

To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to perform two separate multiplications and then add the results together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats: 3 goats * $500 = 3 × 500 = $1500.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the cows: 2 cows * $1500 = 2 × 1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the two results together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"As an expert in arithmetic operations, I can confidently calculate the number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy for his birthday party.

To determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul should purchase, we need to subtract the total number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes required.

Let's denote the total number of cupcakes needed as C, the number of chocolate cupcakes as Ch, and the number of toffee cupcakes as Tf. We are given that C = 63, Ch = 8, and Tf = 40.

The total number of cupcakes Paul already has is the sum of the chocolate and toffee cupcakes: Ch + Tf = 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, we can calculate the number of additional cupcakes Paul needs to buy by subtracting the total number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes required: C - (Ch + Tf) = 63 - 48 = 15.

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the given information:

- Robert has 20 cars.
- Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Now, let's calculate the number of cars Joe sells. He sells 20% of his cars, which can be expressed as 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Next, we need to find out how many cars Joe gives away. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

To find the total number of cars Joe gives away, we add the number of cars he sold and the number he gave away: 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

Finally, to determine how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"As a subtraction and division expert, I can confidently tackle this problem. To find out how much each student raised, we need to isolate the amount contributed by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that comes from organizations. 

To find the amount raised by the students, we subtract the organizational contribution from the total:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can confidently calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days.

To find the total time, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 × 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 × 60 = 240 minutes

Now, let's add the time from both days: 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, let's determine the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

Next, we need to find the number of cars that left the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break. It's given that 1/2 of the cars had gone. To find 1/2 of 70, we can divide 70 by 2:

70 ÷ 2 = 35

So, 35 cars left the parking lot. To find the number of cars remaining, we subtract 35 from the total number of cars after the first break:

70 - 35 = 35

Now, we need to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

The final answer is: 35"

Total tasks per day = 30 * 5
Total tasks per day = 150

Next, we calculate the daily earnings by multiplying the total tasks per day by the pay per task.

Pay per task: $1.20

Daily earnings = 150 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

To find the weekly earnings, we multiply the daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

"When tackling multi-step arithmetic word problems, it's essential to break down the information provided and address each step systematically. In this scenario, we have two games with specific point differentials between Sasha and Julie's scores.

Let's start by identifying the key information:

1. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game.
3. Sasha struggles during away games, and their second match was at Julie's home court.
4. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game.

To find Sasha's total points, we need to calculate her score in both games and add them together.

First, we determine Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, we subtract 4 from Sasha's score: 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Next, we find Sasha's score in the second game. We know she scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, which was 10 points. So, we subtract 6 from Julie's score: 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"When calculating the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we first need to determine the total number of tins of each type. To do this, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package.

For cat food, we have 8 packages with 11 tins per package, so the total number of tins of cat food is 8 × 11 = 88.

For dog food, we have 6 packages with 6 tins per package, so the total number of tins of dog food is 6 × 6 = 36.

Now, to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations representing the number of cards each person has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of ratios and basic arithmetic operations. Let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We are given the following information:
- G = 5 (number of green eggs)
- B = 2G (number of blue eggs, which is twice the number of green eggs)
- P = B - 1 (number of pink eggs, which is one fewer than the number of blue eggs)
- Y = (1/3)P (number of yellow eggs, which is one-third the number of pink eggs)

Now, let's substitute the given values and calculate the number of each color of eggs:
- B = 2G = 2(5) = 10
- P = B - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
- Y = (1/3)P = (1/3)(9) = 3

To find the total number of eggs, we need to add the number of eggs of each color together:

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has after her father gave her $100. This is a simple addition problem: $40 (initial amount) + $100 (gift from father) = $140.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mulan spent on the jeans and the bag. The cost of two pairs of jeans is 2 × $30 = $60. The cost of the bag is $20. So, the total amount of money she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the production for the fourth week of Boris's chocolate factory.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

Let's break it down:

- Week 1: 8,000 bars
- Week 2: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
- Week 3: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add the production for the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000

Next, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"As a time conversion expert, I'll break down Britany's weekly activities to calculate the total time she spends on TikTok in a month.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week:

1. Writing songs: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
2. Makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
3. Recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes

Now, let's add these times together to find the total time Britany spends on TikTok per week: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4 to find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"As a cost estimator with extensive experience in calculating installation costs, I can break down the problem into manageable components.

The initial installation package includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for a fixed price of $129.00. To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items Angela requires.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed. Since the initial package already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the initial installation to the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we need to establish the relationships between the savings of Roy, Anthony, and Eva.

Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony's savings can be calculated as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now, we need to find Roy's savings, which is 40% more than Anthony's savings. To calculate 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply his savings by 0.4:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 × $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

To find Roy's total savings, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

The final answer is: $42.00"
"Given the problem, we have a series of ratios describing the relative lifting abilities of Naruto, Kagiyami, Saskay, and Pompei. We can represent these ratios as follows:

Let P be the height Pompei can lift, S be the height Saskay can lift, K be the height Kagiyami can lift, and N be the height Naruto can lift.

We are given that:
- N = 10K
- K = 4S
- S = 12P

We are also given that P = 1 inch.

To find the height Naruto can lift, we need to find the value of N. We can start by finding the value of S, then K, and finally N.

S = 12P = 12(1) = 12 inches

K = 4S = 4(12) = 48 inches

N = 10K = 10(48) = 480 inches

To convert inches to feet, we use the conversion factor 1 foot = 12 inches.

N (in feet) = 480 / 12 = 40 feet

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total distance traveled by Mason, who is cycling at a constant speed of 8 miles per hour. To solve this, we'll apply the fundamental principles of multiplication and addition.

First, we'll calculate the distance covered in the initial 4 hours. This can be computed as the product of the speed and time, which is a basic operation in multiplication.

Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, we'll determine the distance covered in the subsequent 6 hours, again using the multiplication operation.

Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, to find the total distance traveled, we'll add the two distances together, which is a straightforward application of the addition operation.

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Mason is 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"When tackling word problems involving distance, rate, and time, it's essential to identify the key elements and apply the formula: time = distance / rate. In this scenario, we're given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cover the distance across the highway.

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k' and the distance as 'd'. We can set up the equation: 3k * 18 = d, where 'd' represents the distance covered by the kangaroos.

Now, we're asked to find the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cover the same distance. Let's denote the speed of a turtle as 't'. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we have t = k/2.

We know that the distance 'd' remains the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up the equation for the turtles: 4t * time = d, where 'time' is the time it takes for the turtles to cover the distance.

Substituting t = k/2 into the equation, we get: 4(k/2) * time = d. Simplifying this, we get 2k * time = d.

Now, we can equate the two expressions for 'd': 3k * 18 = 2k * time. Solving for time, we get time = (3k * 18) / (2k) = 27 hours.

Therefore, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the relationship between the number of dishes made by each person. Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as x. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, the number of dishes made by Rory is x + 20. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so the number of dishes made by Jada is 2(x + 20).

We are given that Kora made 20 dishes, so we can substitute x = 20 into the expressions for Rory and Jada's dishes:

Rory's dishes = x + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
Jada's dishes = 2(x + 20) = 2(20 + 20) = 2(40) = 80

Now, we can find the total number of dishes made by adding the number of dishes made by each person:

Total dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
= 20 + 40 + 80
= 140

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they made together is 140."
"As a subtraction and addition expert, I'll break down the problem step by step to determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse.

First, we need to calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one. This is a simple subtraction problem:

$600 (original price) - $200 (discount) = $400

Next, we know that Erika received a total of $230 from her part-time job and her mom's contribution. To find out how much money she had initially, we need to subtract this amount from the total amount she has now, which is the price of the laptop after the discount plus the extra money she needs:

$400 (price after discount) + $50 (extra money needed) = $450 (total amount she has now)

Now, we can subtract the amount she received from the total amount she has now to find the initial amount in her purse:

$450 (total amount she has now) - $230 (amount received) = $220

Therefore, Erika has $220 in her purse.

The final answer is: $220"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of apple slices and then subtracting the number of slices Adam eats. To begin, we need to determine the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

The number of slices from 3 large apples is calculated as 3 × 5 = 15. This is a straightforward application of the multiplication operation, where 3 is the multiplier and 5 is the multiplicand.

Similarly, the number of slices from 5 small apples is calculated as 5 × 3 = 15. Again, this is a simple multiplication operation, where 5 is the multiplier and 3 is the multiplicand.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices: 15 + 15 = 30.

However, Adam eats 15 slices, so we need to subtract this from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we first need to establish the milk production rate per cow. Given that each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can calculate the required number of cows using division.

Let's denote the number of cows needed as 'x'. The equation to represent the situation is:

5x = 25

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5

x = 5

This means that 5 cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we can find the number of additional cows needed by subtracting the number of cows already present from the total required:

Additional cows needed = 5 - 3

Additional cows needed = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

First, let's find the unused portion of the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left. To do this, we multiply the fraction 1/6 by the original length of the glue stick, which is 12 millimeters.

$$\frac{1}{6} \times 12 = \frac{1 \times 12}{6} = \frac{12}{6} = 2$$

The unused portion of the first glue stick is 2 millimeters.

Next, we'll find the unused portion of the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left. We multiply the fraction 2/3 by the original length of the glue stick, which is 12 millimeters.

$$\frac{2}{3} \times 12 = \frac{2 \times 12}{3} = \frac{24}{3} = 8$$

The unused portion of the second glue stick is 8 millimeters.

Finally, we'll find the unused portion of the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left. We multiply the fraction 1/2 by the original length of the glue stick, which is 12 millimeters.

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = \frac{1 \times 12}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6$$

The unused portion of the third glue stick is 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the unused portions together to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used.

$$2 + 8 + 6 = 16$$

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"As an expert in arithmetic operations, I can calculate the amount of money Gabriel still needs to buy the car and phone.

To find the total cost of the items, I will add the cost of the car and the phone: $10000 + $800 = $10080.

Next, I will calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has: $5000 (from working) + $200 (from brother) = $5200.

"As an expert in addition, subtraction, and multiplication, I can efficiently calculate the amount of money Craig has left.

Craig starts with 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is equivalent to 2 × $20 = $40.

He then spends $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 × $2 = $12.

Additionally, he spends $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 × $3 = $9.

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of squirt guns and water balloons: $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of socks and dishes Jack and Peter have.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S and the number of dishes Jack has as D. We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so D = 60.

We are also given that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, which can be represented as D = 2S. Substituting D = 60 into this equation, we get 60 = 2S, so S = 30.

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter's socks can be represented as 2S = 2(30) = 60.

We are also given that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter's dishes can be represented as D/2 = 60/2 = 30.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we can add the number of socks and dishes Jack and Peter have:

Total socks = S + 2S = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = D + D/2 = 60 + 30 = 90

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"When dealing with overlapping sets, it's essential to apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. In this scenario, we have three groups: students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both math and English.

Let's denote the total number of students as T, students good at math only as M, students good at English only as E, and students good at both as B. We're given that T = 20, M = 5, and E = 8.

To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students good at math only and those good at both math and English. However, since the students good at both are counted in both groups, we need to subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting.

The formula to find the total number of students good at math is: M + B.

To find B, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion: T = M + E + B - (M ∩ E), where (M ∩ E) represents the students good at both math and English. Since we don't have the exact value of (M ∩ E), we can rearrange the formula to find B: B = T - M - E.

Now, let's substitute the given values: B = 20 - 5 - 8 = 7.

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the total number of students good at math: M + B = 5 + 7 = 12.

Therefore, the total number of students good at math is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"When planning a pop concert, it's essential to consider the time constraints for each group's performance, including setup, performance, and teardown. In this case, Vicki allows each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, totaling 10 minutes per group.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. However, we need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total time to determine the available time for performances: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

To find the maximum number of groups that can perform, we divide the available time for performances by the time each group takes: 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to apply the formula for simple interest: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal (initial investment), r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, we can express it as r = 0.75. The principal amount P is $300, and the time period t is 3 years.

The interest earned each year is given by I = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225. However, since this is a simple interest problem, we can also express the interest as I = P * r * t.

To find the total amount after 3 years, we can use the formula A = P(1 + rt). Substituting the values, we get:

A = $300(1 + 0.75 * 3)
A = $300(1 + 2.25)
A = $300 * 3.25
A = $975

The final answer is: $975"
"As a specialist in subset analysis, I'll break down the problem into manageable parts to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

First, let's identify the total number of white shirts and the number of white shirts with collars. We have 40 white shirts in total, and half of them have collars. So, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20.

To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts: 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, let's analyze the floral shirts. We have 50 floral shirts in total, and 20 of them have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. This difference is simply 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the farmer's earnings, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray and then multiply the result by the price per tray.

The division operation is a fundamental concept in mathematics, and in this case, it's a straightforward calculation. We have 900 eggs and each tray holds 30 eggs. 

900 ÷ 30 = 30

Now, we multiply the result by the price per tray, which is $2.5.

30 × $2.5 = $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75 from selling the eggs.

"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the number of goats left in the two farms.

First, let's calculate the number of goats left in Farm X. We start with 55 goats and subtract 10 goats that were sold. This can be represented as:

55 - 10 = 45

Next, we need to find the number of goats sold from Farm Y. Since twice as many goats were sold from Farm Y as from Farm X, we multiply the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2:

10 * 2 = 20

Now, we calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y by subtracting the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats:

45 - 20 = 25

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:

45 + 25 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"The art of division - a fundamental operation in mathematics that allows us to determine the quotient of two quantities. In this case, we're tasked with finding the average cost of each pair of shoes James purchases.

Given that James spends $2640 on shoes each year and buys 2 pairs of shoes per month, we can calculate the total number of pairs he buys annually. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of pairs bought per month by 12:

2 pairs/month × 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, to find the average cost of each pair, we divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24):

$$\frac{\$2640}{24} = \$110$$

Therefore, the average cost of each pair of shoes is $110.

"To determine the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms and we want to clean one-half of them, we can represent this as a fraction: 90/2.

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

90/2 = 45

Now that we know we need to clean 45 rooms, we can calculate the total time it takes to clean them. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we can multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 45 * 20 minutes

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately.

45 * 20 = 900 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes by 60.

900 minutes / 60 = 900/60

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 60.

900/60 = 15

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote my age as x, my brother's age as x + 3, my sister's age as x - 2, and my mom's age as 3(x + 3) - 1.

We are given that the sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can rewrite the equation as: 8x = 70.

Since 8x is a multiple of 8, we can try to find a whole number solution by dividing 70 by 8. However, 70 is not a multiple of 8, so we need to find the closest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 70.

The closest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 70 is 64. However, 64 is not equal to 70, so we need to find the next multiple of 8.

The next multiple of 8 is 72, but that is greater than 70. Therefore, we need to find a whole number solution that is less than 8.75.

Let's try x = 15. However, this is not a solution since 15 + 18 + 13 + 3(18) - 1 = 87, which is equal to 87.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for his students.

The total number of students in Mr. Jackson's class is 27, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. Therefore, the total number of glue sticks required is:

27 students × 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find the number of packs needed:

54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

As a division expert, I can tell you that when dividing a number by another number, if the result is not a whole number, it indicates that the divisor (in this case, 8 glue sticks per pack) does not evenly divide the dividend (54 glue sticks). To find the number of whole packs needed, we must round up to the nearest whole number. This is a fundamental principle in division, ensuring that we have enough of the item (in this case, packs of glue sticks) to meet the requirement.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure every student has 2 glue sticks, with some extra glue sticks left over.

The final answer is: 7"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total amount of water passing through a river at a specific point over three consecutive days. We are given the following information:

- The initial amount of water on the first day is 4000 gallons.
- The amount of water doubles on the second day.
- The amount of water increases by 6000 gallons on the third day.

To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the amount of water on the second day, which is a simple multiplication of the initial amount by 2:

2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons

Next, we add the increase in water on the third day to the amount on the second day:

8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

Now, we need to add the initial amount of water on the first day to the total amount on the third day to find the overall total:

4000 + 14000 = 16000 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 16000 gallons.

The final answer is: 16000"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of exponential growth, where the number of infected individuals increases at a rate proportional to the current population. This is a characteristic of a geometric progression, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant.

Let's denote the initial number of infected individuals as $n_0 = 10$ and the daily growth rate as $r = 6$. The number of new infections each day can be modeled as a geometric sequence, where the number of infected individuals at each time step $t$ is given by:

$n_t = n_{t-1} \cdot r$

We can calculate the number of infected individuals at each time step as follows:

Day 1: $n_1 = n_0 \cdot r = 10 \cdot 6 = 60$
Day 2: $n_2 = n_1 \cdot r = 60 \cdot 6 = 360$
Day 3: $n_3 = n_2 \cdot r = 360 \cdot 6 = 2160$

However, to find the total number of infected individuals after three days, we need to sum up the number of infected individuals at each time step. This is a geometric series with first term $a = 10$ and common ratio $r = 6$. The sum of a geometric series is given by:

$S_n = a \cdot \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}$

where $n$ is the number of terms. In this case, we have $n = 4$ (since we are considering the initial population and the populations at the end of each of the three days).

Plugging in the values, we get:

$S_4 = 10 \cdot \frac{6^4 - 1}{6 - 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{1296 - 1}{5} = 10 \cdot \frac{1295}{5} = 2590$

However, this calculation only accounts for the initial population and the populations at the end of each day. To get the total number of infected individuals, we need to add the initial population to the sum:

$Total = S_4 + n_0 = 2590 + 10 = 2600$

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the population at the end of the third day, which is 3070."
"To determine the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela as tips, we first need to calculate the amount received by each of them.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving $20. Therefore, her total tips can be calculated as follows:

Rafaela's tips = 40 * $20 = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we can calculate her tips by finding 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtracting it from Rafaela's total.

10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800 = $80

Julieta's tips = Rafaela's tips - 10% of Rafaela's tips
= $800 - $80
= $720

Now, to find the total amount of money they received as tips, we add their individual tips:

Total tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips
= $800 + $720
= $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"As a subtraction expert, I can confidently calculate the number of oranges Jennifer remained with after giving some to her children. 

To find the difference between the initial number of oranges and the number given to her children, we need to subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges. 

Let's denote the initial number of oranges as I = 12 and the total number of oranges given to her children as G = 9. 

The subtraction operation can be represented as: I - G = ?

Using the order of operations, we first subtract the number of oranges given to her boy (3) from the total number of oranges given to her daughters (6), which is 6 - 3 = 3. 

Now, we subtract the result from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 3 = 9.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to subtract the total number of oranges given to her children (9) from the initial number of oranges (12). 

12 - 9 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"Given the scenario, we have a ratio of badges earned by Claire, Amber, and Wendy. Let's denote the time it takes Claire to earn a badge as 't'. Since Amber takes twice as long, the time for Amber is 2t. Wendy earns three times the badges as Claire in the same time frame, so her time to earn a badge is t/3.

The monthly rate of badges earned by each person can be represented as follows:

- Claire: 1 badge / t months
- Amber: 1 badge / (2t) months
- Wendy: 3 badges / t months

To find the number of badges earned in a 1-year time frame (12 months), we can use the formula: (number of badges) = (monthly rate) * (time period). 

For Claire: (1 badge / t) * 12t = 12 badges
For Amber: (1 badge / 2t) * 12t = 6 badges
For Wendy: (3 badges / t) * 12t = 36 badges

Now, to find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount raised by Paige, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices she baked. Since she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a 5-hour interval, and she can bake 2 loaves per hour, we can calculate the total number of loaves as follows:

2 loaves/hour × 5 hours = 10 loaves

Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

10 loaves × 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Now, we need to convert the price per slice from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the price per slice by 100:

50 cents/slice ÷ 100 = $0.50/slice

Now, we can multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

80 slices × $0.50/slice = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To find S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George.

First, we calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. This can be represented as 50 * 10, which is a simple multiplication problem.

50 * 10 = 500

Next, we need to account for the burritos eaten by Mr. George. He consumed 20 burritos.

Now, we add the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George to find the total number of burritos consumed.

500 (burritos eaten by students) + 20 (burritos eaten by Mr. George) = 520

To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the initial number of burritos ordered.

600 (initial number of burritos) - 520 (total number of burritos eaten) = 80

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red cars as R, the number of green cars as G, the number of blue cars as B, and the number of yellow cars as Y.

We are given the following information:

1. The rink has 12 red cars: R = 12.
2. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars: G = R - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10.
3. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars: B = 3G = 3(10) = 30.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75: R + G + B + Y = 75.

Substituting the values of R, G, and B into the total equation, we get:

12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75

Combine like terms:

52 + Y = 75

Subtract 52 from both sides:

Y = 23

Therefore, the rink has 23 yellow cars.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations with three variables. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given the following system of equations:

1) S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2) A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3) S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

We can use substitution or elimination to solve this system. Let's use substitution. From equation (1), we can express S in terms of A: S = A + 25.

Substituting this expression for S into equation (3), we get (A + 25) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms: 2A + F + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides: 2A + F = 60

Now, substitute the expression for A from equation (2) into this equation: 2(F - 12) + F = 60

Distribute the 2: 2F - 24 + F = 60

Combine like terms: 3F - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can express this relationship as a multiplication problem: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Now, we need to find the weight of the carrots, which is 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. This can be expressed as a subtraction problem: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total cost of Jello for Greg's son's birthday party, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and then multiply that by the cost per box.

First, we need to find the total number of Jello cups required. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 × 4 = 120.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello are required. Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 ÷ 10 = 12.

"To determine the amount Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate his monthly expenditure. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

To find 40% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.4:

$400 × 0.4 = $160

This is the amount Keenan spends in a month. To find out how much he spends per week, we divide this amount by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4:

$160 ÷ 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he consumed on each day and sum them up.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. To do this, we'll multiply 2/5 by 60, the total number of pizza pieces.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Next, we'll calculate the number of pieces he ate on the second day, which is given as 10.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. We'll subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total number of pieces.

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find this out, we'll multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day to find the total number of pieces eaten.

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"As a specialist in proportional reasoning and multiplication, I can efficiently solve this problem by applying the principles of unit rates and multiplication.

First, let's find the unit rate for soda and water. The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the unit rate for soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle. Similarly, the cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the unit rate for water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the unit rates by the respective quantities:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 × $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 × $2.00 = $4.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of soda and water: $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we need to perform a simple subtraction operation. However, it's essential to first calculate the total cost of the bolts.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost per bolt by the number of bolts:

16 \* $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after purchasing the bolts.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we need to establish her hourly wage. This can be calculated by dividing the total earnings by the number of hours worked.

Let's denote Ella's hourly wage as 'x'. We know that she earned $33 for 3 hours of work. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x = 33

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 33 / 3
x = 11

Now that we have determined Ella's hourly wage, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours worked:

Earnings after 12 hours = 11 * 12
Earnings after 12 hours = 132

"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 × 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know that he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue from selling these chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

180 × $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000. To find the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens, we add the profit to the revenue:

Total amount = Revenue + Profit
Total amount = $9000 + $2000
Total amount = $11000

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we can set up an equation to find the cost price:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
$9000 = Cost price + $2000

To find the cost price, we subtract the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

Therefore, the cost price of the chickens is $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"As a subtraction expert, I can confidently solve this problem by applying the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to determine the difference between the number of glasses Julie sold and the number of glasses Micah sold.

Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as x. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Mitchell also sold x glasses. The total number of glasses sold by the boys is 2x.

We know that the total number of glasses sold is 32. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x + 14 = 32

Combine like terms:

2x + 14 = 32

Subtract 14 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

Now that we know Micah sold 9 glasses, we can find the difference between the number of glasses Julie sold and the number of glasses Micah sold:

Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
= 14 - 9

"When it comes to multi-step word problems involving multiplication and subtraction, I always start by breaking down the problem into manageable parts. In this case, we have a straightforward scenario where Sarah wants to sell a 20-meter rope for $2 per meter and use the profit to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope. This is a simple multiplication problem:

Total revenue = Length of rope (meters) × Price per meter
Total revenue = 20 meters × $2/meter
Total revenue = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. This is another multiplication problem:

Cost of new rope = Length of new rope (meters) × Price per meter
Cost of new rope = 20 meters × $1.5/meter
Cost of new rope = $30

To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to subtract the cost of the new rope from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Cost of new rope
Profit = $40 - $30
Profit = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple linear equation. Let's denote Melanie's current age as 'x'. In 10 years, her age will be 18, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 18

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 8

Now, we need to find out when her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age 't'. At that time, her age will be x + t, and it will be thrice her current age, which is 3x. So, we can set up the equation:

x + t = 3x

Substituting x = 8 into the equation, we get:

8 + t = 3(8)

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:

8 + t = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation gives us:

t = 16

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon at $10 each is 5 × $10 = $50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10, each packet of chicken costs 2 × $10 = $20. The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 × $20 = $120.

Now, let's find the cost of the strawberries: 3 packs of strawberries at $4 each is 3 × $4 = $12.

The cost of the apples is 7 packs at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs $4 ÷ 2 = $2. The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 × $2 = $14.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $50 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $196.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $196 = -$131.

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $131."
"To solve for the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the runtime of her usual concert as x minutes.

The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so its runtime is 2x minutes. Additionally, the encore is 15 minutes long. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which can be expressed as the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, we need to consider the total number of microphones and the percentage that won't fit. 

Let's denote the total number of microphones as M. We know that 20% of M won't fit, which means 80% of M will be arranged in pairs. 

We can express this as: 80% of M = 2x, where x is the number of pairs of microphones.

Given that M = 50, we can substitute this value into the equation: 0.8 * 50 = 2x
40 = 2x
x = 40 / 2

"To determine the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's consider the birds nesting in the bushes. We have a straightforward count of 6 birds.

Next, we have 2/3 of the number of birds flying overhead. To find this, we multiply 6 by 2/3, which can be expressed as:

6 × (2/3) = 6 × 2 / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

Now, let's calculate the number of birds feeding. We have 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8:

3 × 8 = 24

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group:

6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"The task at hand is a straightforward application of arithmetic operations. To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we must first subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies, and then divide the result by the number of jars.

Let's begin by subtracting the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies:

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Next, we'll divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars to find the number of cookies in each jar:

Number of jars = 5
Cookies per jar = Cookies left ÷ Number of jars = 50 ÷ 5 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

The total number of petals on the orchids is calculated by multiplying the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 × 5 = 25 petals.

The total number of petals on the daisies is calculated by multiplying the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 × 10 = 40 petals.

Now, to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15 petals.

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to calculate the proportion of plants that are not indoor or outdoor plants.

First, we find the number of indoor plants: 100 * (1/4) = 25.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75.

Next, we calculate the number of outdoor plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50.

Now, we find the number of flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given the problem, we have a system of proportional relationships between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. We are given that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11x. We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

We can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5x
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: 55"
"Given the scenario, we have a system of linear equations representing the total cost of Ellen's daily goods. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. The cost of 2 carrots is then 2x. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3.

We can represent the total cost equation as:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1."
"As a multiplication expert, I can confidently calculate Mark's weekly earnings. To determine his new hourly wage, we need to add the hourly wage increase to his original hourly wage. This is a simple addition problem: $10 (original hourly wage) + $2 (hourly wage increase) = $12 (new hourly wage).

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week. This is a straightforward multiplication problem: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can calculate Mark's weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a system of linear equations to solve for the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Similarly, since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, $18 for mowing Kamala's lawn, and $30 for mowing Alba's lawn. Therefore, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To solve for y, we need to isolate the variable y. Subtracting 54x from both sides of the equation gives us y = 80 - 54x.

However, we need to find the value of x first. We know that the total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation 6x = 6, which implies x = 1.

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the equation y = 80 - 54x to find the amount she made from lemonade sales.

y = 80 - 54(1)
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"As a seasoned expert in multi-step arithmetic operations, I'll break down the problem step by step to determine Harry's weight.

Given:
- Martin's weight is 55 kg.
- Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight.
- Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.
- Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.

To find Harry's weight, I'll start by calculating Carl's weight, which is 16 kg more than Martin's weight.

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, I'll calculate Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, I'll determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The final answer is: 74"
"To calculate John's profit from renting his car, we need to consider the total earnings from rentals and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate the total earnings from renting his car. We know he rents it 10 times a month for 3 hours each time and gets paid $25 an hour.

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha had initially as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, the number of notebooks Joseph had is 3x.

We are given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented by the equation x + 5 = 7, where x is the initial number of notebooks Martha had.

Solving for x, we get:

x + 5 = 7
x = 7 - 5
x = 2

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had by multiplying 2 by 3:

3x = 3(2)
3x = 6

So, Joseph had 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

7 - 6 = 1

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To calculate the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we need to first determine the distance rowed by Anis. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this as a mathematical expression: Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance).

Given that Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can substitute this value into the expression: Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50).

To calculate 1/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is equivalent to dividing 50 by 5. This gives us 50 / 5 = 10 miles.

Now, we add this value to Dijana's distance: Anis' distance = 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is the sum of their individual distances: Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance = 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"As a subtraction and division expert, I can confidently solve this problem by first subtracting the number of cookies taken by Susan's husband from the total number of cookies. This is a straightforward application of the subtraction operation.

Let's denote the total number of cookies as T, the number of cookies taken by Susan's husband as H, and the number of cookies left as L. We have:

T = 100
H = 4

To find the number of cookies left, we perform the subtraction operation:

L = T - H
L = 100 - 4
L = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. This is a division operation, and we can express it as:

Number of cookies per nephew = L / Number of nephews
= 96 / 6
= 16

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently calculate the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel.

Let's break it down step by step:

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find the total number of pages read by Denise, we add the pages she read yesterday and today: 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

Daniel, on the other hand, did not read any pages today, so his total remains 13 pages.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel: 28 - 13 = 15.

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Given the scenario, we have a pot that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. This implies a ratio of 1:2 between adult and child bowls, as 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child bowls.

Since there are 4 adults (including Calvin and his wife) and 2 children, a total of 6 people will eat dinner. The number of child bowls used for dinner is 4, as 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls.

To find the number of child bowls left, we subtract the number of child bowls used from the total capacity of the pot: 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls.

Now, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. Since there are 2 children, we divide the number of child bowls left by the number of children: 4 ÷ 2 = 2.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can set up a system of equations based on the given ratios.

Let's denote the amount of material needed for small masks as 's' and the amount of material needed for large masks as 'l'. We know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks, so the ratio of material to small masks is 2:4 or 1:2. This can be expressed as:

s = 2x

We also know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks, so the ratio of material to large masks is 2.25:3 or 3:4. This can be expressed as:

l = (3/4) * 2.25x

However, we can simplify this expression to:

l = 1.6875x

Now, we need to find the total amount of material needed for 20 small and 8 large masks. We can set up an equation based on the given information:

Total material = (s * 20) + (l * 8)
Total material = (2x * 20) + (1.6875x * 8)
Total material = 40x + 13.5x
Total material = 53.5x

We also know that the total amount of material needed is equal to the sum of the material needed for small and large masks. Since we are given that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks and 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks, we can set up another equation:

2 + 2.25 = 4s + 3l
2 + 2.25 = 4(2x) + 3(1.6875x)
2 + 2.25 = 8x + 5.0625x
2 + 2.25 = 13.0625x
14.25 = 13.0625x

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 14.25 / 13.0625
x = 1.092

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the expression for the total material:
Total material = 53.5x
Total material = 53.5 * 1.092
Total material = 58.404

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:
Total material = 58 yards

= 18

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had:

Joseph's current books = Joseph's initial books - 2
= 18 - 2
= 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total number of marbles he gave away. 

First, let's find 1/5 of 30. To do this, we can multiply 30 by 1/5, which is equivalent to dividing 30 by 5. 

30 ÷ 5 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Next, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find the number of marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the initial number of marbles. 

30 - 16 = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"As a specialist in rates and calculations, I can efficiently determine Colby's earnings in an 8-hour workday. 

To calculate his earnings, we first need to find out how many packages he completes in an hour. Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can express this as 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. This can be found by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Given that he earns $0.20 for every package, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying the total number of packages by his hourly rate: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

Therefore, Colby's earnings in a typical 8-hour workday are $64.

"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the puzzle and then convert that time to the number of 30-minute intervals, which corresponds to the frequency at which he drinks a bottle.

First, we know that a normal sudoku takes 45 minutes to solve. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, so we can calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku as follows:

t_extreme = 4 * t_normal
t_extreme = 4 * 45 minutes
t_extreme = 180 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, we can find the number of bottles he drinks by dividing the total time by 30 minutes:

n_bottles = t_extreme / 30 minutes
n_bottles = 180 minutes / 30 minutes
n_bottles = 6

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red balloons as r and the number of yellow balloons as y.

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, and there are 20 red balloons. We can set up the following system of linear equations:

2r + 3y = 58 ... (Equation 1)
r = 20 ... (Equation 2)

Since we already know the value of r, we can substitute it into Equation 1 to solve for y:

2(20) + 3y = 58

Expanding the equation, we get:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

y = 6

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the given information:

- The cost of the cake is $11.
- The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.
- The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we need to divide the total amount by 2.

The formula for this is: Total Amount / 2 = Amount per Person

Substituting the values, we get: $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, each of them received $14.

"As a seasoned expert in profit analysis, I'll break down the problem step by step to determine the class's profit from selling lollipops.

First, let's calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of lollipops. We know that each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 per lollipop, and there are 30 students in the class.

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Next, we need to calculate the total cost incurred by the class to purchase the lollipops. The cost per lollipop is $0.5, and each student bought 10 lollipops.

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Now, we can calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we need to break down the information provided and calculate the number of each type of pet.

Let's start by identifying the number of cats, which is given as 3.

Since Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can express this as a ratio: dogs : cats = 3 : 1. Therefore, the number of dogs is 3 times the number of cats, which is 3 * 3 = 9.

Next, we're told that Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. This can be expressed as a subtraction: rabbits = dogs - 2. Substituting the value of dogs, we get rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7.

Now, we're given that Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. This can be expressed as a ratio: fish : rabbits = 3 : 1. Therefore, the number of fish is 3 times the number of rabbits, which is 3 * 7 = 21.

We're also told that Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. This can be expressed as a proportion: gerbils : fish = 1/3 : 1. Therefore, the number of gerbils is 1/3 times the number of fish, which is (1/3) * 21 = 7.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

"As a division expert, I can confidently calculate the number of days a loaf of bread will last for Abby and Josh. 

To determine the total number of slices they can eat per day, we need to consider their individual consumption rates. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

The combined daily consumption rate is the sum of their individual rates: 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

Now, to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption rate: 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"The problem at hand is a straightforward application of multiplication. We're given that Martha collects one shell per month and has been collecting for a total of 5 years. To find the total number of shells collected, we need to multiply the number of years by the number of months in a year.

The formula for this calculation is:

Total shells = Number of years × Number of months/year

We know that there are 12 months in a year, so we can plug in the values:

Total shells = 5 years × 12 months/year

Using the fundamental property of multiplication, we can rewrite this as:

Total shells = 5 × 12

To calculate the product, we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition:

5 × 12 = (5 × 10) + (5 × 2)

Using the multiplication facts, we get:

5 × 10 = 50
5 × 2 = 10

Now, we add the two products together:

50 + 10 = 60

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of tea in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can use division to find the number of cups in each row.

27 ÷ 3 = 9

Now that we know there are 9 cups in each row, we can determine the number of mint tea cups in each row. Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can represent the number of mint tea cups as x. The number of chamomile tea cups is also x, and the total number of tea cups in each row is 2x.

We know that the total number of tea cups in each row is 9, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 9

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 9 ÷ 2
x = 4.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we need to consider the context of the problem. We know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since there are 3 rows, and each row has 9 cups, the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 3 * 9 = 27. This means that the 15 cups of cinnamon tea are made from the remaining cups, which is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Since there are 3 rows, and the total number of mint tea cups is 15, we can set up the equation:

3x = 15

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 15 ÷ 3
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth collects berries and then use that rate to find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip.

Let's denote the number of berries the sloth picks up per trip as 'b'. Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

The total number of berries the sloth wants to collect in 8 hours is 24. Since he makes 2 trips, we can set up the equation 2b = 24, where 'b' is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

To find the value of 'b', we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2b / 2 = 24 / 2
b = 12

Therefore, the sloth can pick up a minimum of 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. First, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

Initial water in the pool = 10,000 gallons
Initial water in the tank = 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons

Next, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can calculate this as follows:

Water used per day = 500 gallons
Total water used in 6 days = 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons

Now, we need to find the remaining amount of water in the tank. We can do this by subtracting the amount of water used from the initial amount:

Remaining water in the tank = Initial water in the tank - Total water used in 6 days
= 5,000 - 3,000
= 2,000 gallons

Therefore, the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days is 2,000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by calculating the total amount Colby has spent so far.

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

However, we need to consider that Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 movies on other days. To find out how many movies he can see in total, we need to add the movies he can see on Friday or Saturday to the movies he can see on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to determine the calories of each type of pastry and then sum them.

First, let's find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. Therefore, the calories of a mini cinnamon roll are given by:

Calories of a mini cinnamon roll = (1/3) * 600
= 600 / 3
= 200 calories

Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are:

Total calories from cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200
= 40,000 calories

Next, let's find the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. Therefore, the calories of a mini blueberry muffin are given by:

Calories of a mini blueberry muffin = (1/3) * 450
= 450 / 3
= 150 calories

Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are:

Total calories from blueberry muffins = 300 * 150
= 45,000 calories

The total calories from both types of pastries are the sum of the calories from cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins:

Total calories = Total calories from cinnamon rolls + Total calories from blueberry muffins
= 40,000 + 45,000
= 85,000 calories

The final answer is: 85000"
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

Let's start by calculating the total number of Junebugs removed. On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. So, for Tuesday and Wednesday, the total is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"The problem at hand involves calculating the difference in distance traveled by a bus and a car. To begin, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. 

The bus, traveling at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, covers a distance of 60 * 5 = 300 miles. 

Similarly, the car, traveling at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, covers a distance of 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To determine how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"The problem at hand is a simple arithmetic operation involving subtraction. To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls.

Let's denote the number of blocks as B, the number of stuffed animals as A, the number of rings as R, and the number of bouncy balls as x. We are given the following information:

B = 31
A = 8
R = 9
Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls = B + A + R + x = 62

To find the number of bouncy balls, we can rearrange the equation to isolate x:

x = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - (B + A + R)
x = 62 - (31 + 8 + 9)
x = 62 - 48
x = 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given the system of linear equations:

1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

We can start by substituting equation (2) into equation (1):
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute equation (3) into the above equation:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 80/4
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"The scenario involves distributing water balloons among a group of people. To determine the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. This can be represented as:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

The multiplication operation here is a simple example of the distributive property of multiplication over addition. In this case, 4 * 2 is equivalent to 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, which equals 8.

Now, let's consider the additional balloons given by Maria's mom. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), and each person receives 3 more balloons, we can calculate the total number of additional balloons as:
5 * 3 = 15

This is a straightforward application of the multiplication operation, where 5 is multiplied by 3 to yield 15.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the number of tables needed for the charity yard sale, we must first calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

The number of boxes donated by 10 people is 10 × 5 = 50 boxes. 
Adding the 10 boxes they already have, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, the number of tables required is 60 ÷ 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they have from the total number of tables required: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 more tables for the yard sale.

The final answer is: 15"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in their watermelon seed spitting contest. To begin, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each participant.

Zoey's watermelon contains 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. Therefore, her total distance spat is the product of the number of seeds and the distance each seed is spat: 40 × 10 = 400 feet.

Similarly, Sydney's watermelon contains 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. Thus, her total distance spat is the product of the number of seeds and the distance each seed is spat: 35 × 12 = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we need to add the total distances spat by both participants and divide by the total number of seeds spat. The total distance spat is 400 + 420 = 820 feet. The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

Now, we can calculate the average total distance spat by dividing the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 ÷ 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.93}$"
"When evaluating the profitability of the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, it's essential to consider their hourly production rates and the total number of hours they operate in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours each machine operates in a month:

24 hours/day * 30 days = 720 hours/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 720 hours/month = 43,200 widgets/month
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 720 hours/month = 32,400 widgets/month

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200/month
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400/month

To determine the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, the Widgeteer 3000 will generate $64,800 more in revenue than the WidgetMaster 9000 per month.

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to calculate the cost of the 24-hour option and the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option with additional hours over the 24-hour option.

The final answer is: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount each sheep requires. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can express this relationship as:

Sheep's hay requirement = (2 * Goat's hay requirement) - 3
Sheep's hay requirement = (2 * 5) - 3
Sheep's hay requirement = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay requirement = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach, breaking it down into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week.

Earnings = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Earnings = 50 * 6
Earnings = 300

Next, we need to subtract the cost of gas and the deposit from John's earnings.

Remaining money = Earnings - Gas cost - Deposit
Remaining money = 300 - 50 - 100
Remaining money = 150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils.

Cost of pencils = Number of pencils * Cost per pencil
Cost of pencils = 5 * 10
Cost of pencils = 50

Subtract the cost of pencils from the remaining money.

Remaining money after buying pencils = Remaining money - Cost of pencils
Remaining money after buying pencils = 150 - 50
Remaining money after buying pencils = 100

Finally, let's determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money.

Number of pens = Remaining money after buying pencils / Cost per pen
Number of pens = 100 / 25
Number of pens = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled out after ten rounds.

First, we calculate the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled out. Since Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, we can find the total number of letters by multiplying the number of words by the number of letters in each word:

20 * 15 = 300

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters his brother spelled:

"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to follow a straightforward process. 

First, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. Since there are 29 pupils in the class and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 29 * 2 = 58.

Next, we need to find out how many bottles the teacher has in total. She has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. This can be represented as 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find the number of bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she has: 900 - 58.

To perform this subtraction, we can use the following steps:

900 - 50 = 850
850 - 8 = 842

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

The final answer is: 842"
"When calculating the total cost for a service, it's essential to break down the charges into their respective components. In this case, we have a visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost.

The visit fee is a flat rate of $40. The labor cost is calculated based on the hourly rate of $35, multiplied by the number of hours worked, which is 2.25 hours. This can be expressed as:

Labor cost = $35/hour * 2.25 hours
Labor cost = $35 * 2.25
Labor cost = $78.75

The cost of parts is $60.

To find the total cost, we add the labor cost, parts cost, and visit fee:

Total cost = Labor cost + Parts cost + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

Therefore, the total amount Patty charged for the job is $178.75."
"To determine the amount James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the revenue from selling the unwanted CDs, and then find the difference between the two.

The original price of each CD is $15. James bought 10 CDs, so the total cost is:

10 * $15 = $150

However, James received a 40% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (40% or 0.4):

$150 * 0.4 = $60

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final cost:

$150 - $60 = $90

James decided to sell 5 CDs for $40 each. The total revenue from selling these CDs is:

5 * $40 = $200

To find out how much James was out, we subtract the revenue from the final cost:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, James was out $110.

The final answer is: $110"

"To tackle this problem, let's break it down into manageable parts. James has to swim across a 20-mile lake at a pace of 2 miles per hour. He swims 60% of the distance, which is a fraction of the total distance.

First, we need to find 60% of 20 miles. To do this, we multiply 20 miles by 0.6, which is equivalent to 60% expressed as a decimal.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 miles = 12 miles

Now, we know James swims 12 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour. To find the time it took him to swim this distance, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Since he swam for 6 hours, he rests for:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2
Rest time = 3 hours

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, we add up the time it took James to swim, rest, and swim the remaining distance to find the total time:

Total time = 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming the remaining distance)
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Let's start by multiplying 70 (the number of loaves Sam had) by 7. This is a straightforward multiplication problem, and I'll apply the distributive property to simplify the calculation: 7 * 70 = 7 * (60 + 10) = 7 * 60 + 7 * 10 = 420 + 70 = 490.

Now, we need to subtract 40 from 490 to find the number of loaves the bakery has: 490 - 40 = 450.

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"

F = 8 + 5
F = 13

Therefore, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13."
"To calculate the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. The formula for commission is (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100. 

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

Now, let's add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Marcus's age as M, and Deanna's age as D.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5. Substituting D = 26, we get M = 26 - 5 = 21.

Furthermore, we are told that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = L/2. Substituting M = 21, we get 21 = L/2.

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate L: L = 21 * 2.

L = 42.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

The final answer is: 42"
"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations with three variables. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We are given the following equations:

1. B = A + 20
2. B = D + 10
3. B + A + D = 45

We can rewrite equations 1 and 2 as:

A - B = -20
D - B = -10

Now, we can add the first two equations to eliminate B:

(A - B) + (D - B) = -20 + (-10)
A + D - 2B = -30

We can rewrite equation 3 as:

B + A + D = 45

Now, we can multiply the rewritten equation 3 by 2 to get:

2B + 2A + 2D = 90

Now, we can add the two equations:

(A + D - 2B) + (2B + 2A + 2D) = -30 + 90
3A + 3D = 60

We can divide both sides by 3 to get:

A + D = 20

Now, we can substitute A + D = 20 into the equation A - B = -20 to get:

A + D - B = -20
20 - B = -20

We can add B to both sides to get:

20 = B

Now that we know B = 20, we can substitute B = 20 into the equation B = A + 20 to get:

20 = A + 20

We can subtract 20 from both sides to get:

0 = A

However, this is not possible since A cannot be 0. Let's go back to the equation A + D = 20. We can substitute B = 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get:

20 + A + D = 45

We can subtract 20 from both sides to get:

A + D = 25

Now, we can substitute A + D = 25 into the equation A - B = -20 to get:

25 - B = -20

We can add B to both sides to get:

25 + B = -20

However, this is not possible since 25 + B cannot be -20. Let's go back to the equation A + D = 25. We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation A + D = 25 to get:

A + (D + 10) = 25

We can simplify this to:

A + D + 10 = 25

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get:

A + D = 15

Now, we can substitute A + D = 15 into the equation A - B = -20 to get:

15 - B = -20

We can add B to both sides to get:

15 + B = -20

However, this is not possible since 15 + B cannot be -20. Let's go back to the equation A + D = 15. We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation A + D = 15 to get:

A + D = 15

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get:

(A + 20) + A + D = 45

We can simplify this to:

2A + D + 20 = 45

We can subtract 20 from both sides to get:

2A + D = 25

Now, we can substitute A + D = 15 into the equation 2A + D = 25 to get:

2A + (15 - A) = 25

We can simplify this to:

A + 15 = 25

We can subtract 15 from both sides to get:

A = 10

Now that we know A = 10, we can substitute A = 10 into the equation A + D = 15 to get:

10 + D = 15

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get:

D = 5

Now that we know D = 5, we can substitute D = 5 into the equation B = D + 10 to get:

B = 5 + 10

This simplifies to:

B = 15

However, we know that B = 20. This is a contradiction. Let's go back to the equation A + D = 15. We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation A + D = 15 to get:

A + D = 15

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation A + D = 15 to get:

A + (D + 10) = 15

We can simplify this to:

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get:

A + D = 5

Now, we can substitute A + D = 5 into the equation 2A + D = 25 to get:

2A + (5 - A) = 25

We can simplify this to:

A + 5 = 25

We can subtract 5 from both sides to get:

A = 20

"When analyzing the problem, we need to consider the relationship between the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. Given that each paper is printed on both sides, we can calculate the total number of pages per inch by multiplying the number of pages per inch by 2.

Let's denote the number of pages per inch as P. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the total number of pages per inch is 2P.

We are given that the book is 1.5 inches thick and that there are 100 pages to the inch. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book can be calculated as follows:

Total pages = 2P * 1.5
Total pages = 2 * 100 * 1.5
Total pages = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total hours to minutes by multiplying 15 hours by 60 minutes per hour:

15 \* 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:

900 ÷ 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:

30 \* 60 = 1800

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate her total sleep duration and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 8 hours by 60 minutes per hour: 8 × 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m. We can convert this to minutes by calculating (6 - 5) hours and 55 minutes, which is (1 × 60) + 55 = 115 minutes after 10 p.m.

Her usual bedtime is 10 p.m., so we can calculate her total sleep duration in minutes as follows: 115 minutes (actual wake-up time) + 480 minutes (usual sleep duration) = 595 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 595 - 23 = 572 minutes.

The final answer is: 572"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 × 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can express this relationship as a proportion. Let's denote the number of spoons as S and the number of cups as C. We have the equation:

S = (2/3)C

Substituting the value of C, we get:

S = (2/3)(24)
S = (2 × 24) / 3
S = 48 / 3
S = 16

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds and then add the number of patients admitted during that period.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we can multiply the total capacity by the fraction of occupied beds.

1000 \* (1/5) = 100

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we can multiply the total capacity by the fraction of unoccupied beds.

1000 \* (4/5) = 800

Now, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we can multiply the number of patients admitted per day by the number of days in 2 weeks.

50 \* 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

100 + 700 = 800

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we find the number of non-work emails. Since Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Next, we calculate the number of emails to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, which can be expressed as (2/3) * 9. To simplify this, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 3 to get (6/9) * 9. This simplifies to 6.

Now, we need to find the number of emails to her boyfriend. The remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. One-third of these emails are to her boyfriend, which can be expressed as (1/3) * 3. This simplifies to 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of proportional relationships and multiplication. Let's break it down step by step.

Given:
- Aliya's age is 3 years.
- Shawna's age is three times Aliya's age.
- Shawna's father's age is five times Shawna's age.

First, we find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3: 3 × 3 = 9 years.

Next, we find Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5: 9 × 5 = 45 years.

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the percentage decrease in the number reported by Courtney. Since Kelly stated that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can express this as a percentage decrease of 20% from Courtney's reported number.

Let's denote the actual number of people as x. We know that Courtney reported 48 people, which is 120% of the actual number (100% + 20% overstatement). We can set up the equation:

48 = 1.20x

To find x, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

x = 48 / 1.20
x = 40

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between the number of balls carried by each boy. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Similarly, since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

We know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. So, the total number of balls is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the number of holes dug on each day.

On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes. 

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

Now, we're told that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can directly use the information that Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others to set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each. Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The cost of travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We have the following equations:

1. A + S + L = 339 (Equation 1)
2. L = S + 5 (Equation 2)
3. S = 4A - 13 (Equation 3)

We can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 to eliminate L:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Now, substitute Equation 3 into the previous equation:
A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S by substituting A into Equation 3:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"The problem at hand involves determining the total time John will spend watching the show. Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can establish a relationship between the two variables.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e' and the length of each episode as 'l'. We are given that l = 20 minutes. Additionally, we know that the number of episodes is half the length of each episode, so e = l / 2.

Substituting the value of l into the equation, we get e = 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: Total Time = e * l = 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

To find the net distance between the two homes, we need to subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction. The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is the sum of the distances traveled in the first and last segments, which is 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles. Subtracting the distance traveled in the northerly direction, we get:

Net distance = Total distance in the southerly direction - Distance in the northerly direction
Net distance = 410 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. We have three different quantities to consider: the dozen brownies she made for herself, the half-dozen brownies from her office, and the four dozen brownies from her friends.

The number of brownies she made for herself is 1 dozen, which is equivalent to 12 brownies. The number of brownies from her office is 1/2 dozen, which is equivalent to 6 brownies. The number of brownies from her friends is 4 dozen, which is equivalent to 4 × 12 = 48 brownies.

To find the total number of brownies received, we add these quantities together:

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48
= 66

Next, we need to calculate the number of brownies eaten. We are given that 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert this to a whole number, we multiply 1 1/2 by 12:

1 1/2 × 12 = 1.5 × 12
= 1 × 12 + 0.5 × 12
= 12 + 6
= 18

Now, we can find the total number of brownies left over by subtracting the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 × 8 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 25% is equivalent to 0.25. So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - (8 × 0.25) = 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the weighted average time based on the proportion of racquets for each type of string.

Let's denote the time for synthetic gut as SG, polyester string as PS, and hybrid sets as H. We have 3 racquets for synthetic gut, 5 for polyester string, and 4 for hybrid sets.

The total number of racquets is 3 + 5 + 4 = 12.

The proportion of racquets for each type of string is:
- Synthetic gut: 3/12 = 0.25
- Polyester string: 5/12 = 0.4167
- Hybrid sets: 4/12 = 0.3333

Now, we can calculate the weighted average time:
Weighted average time = (0.25 * SG) + (0.4167 * PS) + (0.3333 * H)
Weighted average time = (0.25 * 15) + (0.4167 * 22) + (0.3333 * 18)
Weighted average time = 3.75 + 9.1667 + 6
Weighted average time = 18.9167

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the weighted average time is approximately 19 minutes per racquet.

To find the total time, we multiply the weighted average time by the total number of racquets:
Total time = 19 * 12
Total time = 228 minutes

The final answer is: 228"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total cost of purchasing phones for John, his 2 kids, and his wife. Given that the first 2 phones cost $600 each, we can calculate their total cost as follows:

2 * $600 = $1200

Since each subsequent phone is half the price of the initial phone, the cost of the remaining 2 phones is:

2 * ($600 / 2) = 2 * $300 = $600

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first 2 phones to the cost of the remaining 2 phones:

$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, the total cost for all 4 phones is $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"As an expert in addition, I can confidently solve this problem. When dealing with team sizes, it's essential to consider the number of players in each team and then combine them to find the total.

Let's start by identifying the number of players in Carlton's team, which is given as 13. To find the number of players in Zeke's team, we need to add 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team, as Zeke's team has 7 more players.

13 (Carlton's team) + 7 = 20 (Zeke's team)

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we simply add the number of players in each team.

13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To calculate the total number of wooden slats needed for the fence, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula: P = 2(length + width).

Given the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Now that we have the perimeter, we need to calculate the total number of wooden slats required. Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = 2 * P
Total slats needed = 2 * 50
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we determine the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave away to her mom and sister. She gave each of them 2 boxes, so the total number of boxes given away is 2 + 2 = 4. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges given away is 4 * 20 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges she had left after giving some away. This is the difference between the total number of oranges and the number of oranges given away: 240 - 80 = 160.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left: 160 - 40 = 120.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of states in the USA as 'x'. We know that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:

India's states = (1/2)x + 4

We are given that the USA has 50 states. So, we can substitute x = 50 into the equation:

India's states = (1/2)(50) + 4
India's states = 25 + 4
India's states = 29

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

Total states = x + India's states
Total states = 50 + 29
Total states = 79

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to purchase and then subtract the amount he has already saved.

The total cost of the books is the sum of their individual costs: $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to find the remaining amount he needs to earn: $39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $39 - $14 = $25.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the remaining amount he needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5): $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R, the number of cherries Jerry has as J, and the total number of cherries as T.

We know that the total number of cherries is 60, so we can write the equation:

T = R + J + 30 (since Robert has 30 cherries)

We also know that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so we can write another equation:

R = J + 10

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for J:

T = (J + 10) + J + 30
60 = 2J + 40

Subtracting 40 from both sides gives us:

20 = 2J

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

J = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting J from R:

R - J = (J + 10) - J
= 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's analyze the given word problem. We have two variables: the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday (G) and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday (A).

We are given the following information:

1. G = 10 (number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday)
2. A = Sunday's apple pie - 4 (number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday)
3. Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 (number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday)
4. Sunday's apple pie = 15 (number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday)

From (3), we can find the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday: Sunday's gingerbread = 10 + 5 = 15.

From (2), we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday: A = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
Total earnings on Sunday = (Sunday's gingerbread * 6) + (Sunday's apple pie * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her 8-day vacation. Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day.

The total number of times she will reapply sunscreen is the product of the number of hours she spends outside per day and the number of days she will be on vacation: 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application requires 1 ounce of sunscreen, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 32 ounces.

To find the number of bottles she will need, we must divide the total amount of sunscreen (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces). This is a simple division problem:

32 ÷ 8 = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"When calculating the price of the red car in relation to the blue car, we need to consider the discount percentage. Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can express this as a mathematical equation.

Let's denote the price of the blue car as B and the price of the red car as R. We know that the red car is 40% cheaper, which can be represented as 0.6B (since 100% - 40% = 60%, or 0.6).

We are given that the price of the blue car is $100. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

R = 0.6B
R = 0.6 * $100
R = $60

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we simply add their prices together:

Total cost = B + R
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's approach this problem as a system of linear equations. We can represent the current ages of Emil's dad and brother as variables. Let's denote the current age of Emil's dad as D and the current age of his brother as B.

We are given the following information:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

We can translate these statements into a system of linear equations:

Equation 1: D - 5 = 2(19) (since Emil's dad will be 5 years older than Emil when Emil turns 24)
Equation 2: B - 5 = 19/2 (since Emil's brother will be 5 years younger than Emil when Emil turns 24)

Simplifying Equation 1, we get:
D - 5 = 38
D = 43

Simplifying Equation 2, we get:
B - 5 = 9.5
B = 14.5

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we can assume that the brother is 14 years old now, and the problem is consistent with this assumption.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is D + B = 43 + 14 = 57.

The final answer is: $\boxed{57}$"

"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

Let's start with the amount Joe caught on Thursday: 3 pounds. 

Next, we'll calculate the amount he caught on Friday, which is 4 times the amount of Thursday: 4 × 3 = 12 pounds.

Then, we'll calculate the amount he caught on Saturday, which is half the amount of Friday: 12 ÷ 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 ÷ 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, which is 20% of the total class of 30 students.

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we calculate the number of students remaining in the class after removing the football players. 
30 - 6 = 24 students.

Now, we need to find the number of cheerleaders or band members, which is 25% of the remaining 24 students.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members.
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

"To find the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we need to calculate the sum of their shoe sizes and divide by 2.

Let's start by identifying the shoe sizes. Sophie's shoe size is 5. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we can calculate his shoe size by multiplying Sophie's size by 5: 5 × 5 = 25.

Now, we add their shoe sizes together: 5 + 25 = 30.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 2: 30 ÷ 2 = 15.

The average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total cost of filling Pat's flower bed, we need to calculate the number of plants she can fit in the bed and then multiply that by the cost of each plant.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. However, we also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length.

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to calculate 1/2 of 18, which is a simple division problem.

18 ÷ 2 = 9

Now, we need to find the total number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7.

9 × 7 = 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can efficiently calculate the total cost for Katherine's hanging baskets.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias is calculated as follows: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 × 3 × 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines is calculated as follows: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 × 2 × 2.50 = $25.00

Now, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of unit conversion and basic arithmetic operations. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. We know that each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil and each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.

Let's denote the number of sunflowers as S and the number of carnations as C. We are given that S = 4 and C = 10.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers is 3S = 3(4) = 12 pounds.
The total amount of soil used for carnations is 1.5C = 1.5(10) = 15 pounds.

Now, we can find the total amount of soil used for both sunflowers and carnations by adding these two values: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, we can find the amount of soil left for roses by subtracting the total amount used from the total amount available: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, we can find the number of roses that can be planted by dividing the remaining soil by the amount required per rose: 3 ÷ 1 = 3.

Therefore, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. This can be expressed as:

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

This means Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month. To find the total savings in a year, we multiply this amount by the number of months in a year:

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year:

$6,000.00 ÷ $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider the rates at which she performs these tasks. 

Let's analyze the peeling task first. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Amount / Rate

Time = 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's analyze the cooking task. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to cook 90 shrimp, we can use the same formula:

Time = Total Amount / Rate

Time = 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/10 minutes = 3 times 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

2. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

3. The total cooling effect is the sum of the cooling effects during low and high modes: 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

4. However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

5. The net cooling effect is the total cooling effect minus the warming effect: 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as x. Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can express Bill's age at the second sighting as 3x.

We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. Therefore, the time elapsed between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is 75 years. This means that the difference in their ages is 75 years. We can express this as:

3x - x = 75

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 75

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 37.5

Now that we know Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, we can find Bill's age at that time by subtracting 37.5 from the time elapsed between the two sightings, which is 75 years. However, we are asked to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. This means that Bill was 37.5 years old when his dad was 30 years old. To find Bill's age when his dad was 30, we need to find the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad was 30 years old. Since Bill was 37.5 years old at that time, we can set up the equation:

Bill's age when his dad was 30 = 37.5

However, we are looking for Bill's age when his dad saw the comet, which is 30 years old. To find Bill's age at that time, we need to subtract the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad was 30 years old from Bill's current age. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad was 30 years old is 75 years. However, this is the time elapsed between the two sightings, not the time elapsed since Bill's dad was 30 years old.

To find the time elapsed since Bill's dad was 30 years old, we need to find the number of times the comet has orbited the sun since Bill's dad was 30 years old. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can divide the time elapsed between the two sightings (75 years) by the orbital period of the comet (75 years) to find the number of orbits:

75 / 75 = 1

This means that the comet has orbited the sun once since Bill's dad was 30 years old. Therefore, the time elapsed since Bill's dad was 30 years old is 75 years.

Now, we can find Bill's age when his dad was 30 years old by subtracting the time elapsed since Bill's dad was 30 years old from Bill's current age:

Bill's age when his dad was 30 = 37.5 - 75 = -37.5

However, this is not possible, as age cannot be negative. Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means that Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x, where x is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. We also know that the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 30 years old. This means that the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years, and the age of Bill at the second sighting is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

To find Bill's age when his dad was 30 years old, we need to subtract the time elapsed since Bill's dad was 30 years old from Bill's current age. However, we are looking for Bill's age when his dad saw the comet, which is 30 years old.

75 / 75 = 1

This means that the comet has orbited the sun once since Bill's dad was 30 years old. Therefore, the time elapsed since Bill's dad was 30 years old is 75 years.

Now, we can find Bill's age when his dad was 30 years old by subtracting the time elapsed since Bill's dad was 30 years old from Bill's current age.

"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month, which translates to 12 checks per year. Similarly, he writes a check for the gas bill once per month, resulting in 12 checks per year. 

For the church, he writes two checks per month, which is equivalent to 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year. 

Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every three months, or 4 times a year. 

To find the total number of checks, we can add these values together: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of flights made by the first plane and the number of flights to each destination. Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x.

We know that the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

x / 2 = 44

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 2 * 44
x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to Greece. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is:

(3/4)x
= (3/4)(88)
= 66

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is:

(1/2)(x - 66)
= (1/2)(88 - 66)
= (1/2)(22)
= 11

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the combined length of time for the howls of three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. We are given the following information:

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the total time, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time for the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I can confidently solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 × $6 = $12.
3. To find the total amount of money Adam received from his parents, we add the amounts given by his mother and father: $6 + $12 = $18.
4. Since the trousers cost $30, we need to subtract the total amount received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and the ages of Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4, respectively.

We can express the total age of the children as:
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. We can express this as:
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Let's start by adding the amounts collected from the neighbors and the online fund:

$500 (neighbors) + $1500 (online fund) = $2000

This is the total amount collected before Walter's friend donates $200. However, the lawyer's contribution is based on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not including Walter's friend's donation.

So, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is $2000.

Now, let's calculate the lawyer's contribution:

3 × $2000 = $6000

The final answer is: $6000"
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, we can express this as a multiplication problem:

Total cookies = Number of guests × Number of cookies per guest
= 100 × 15
= 1500

Next, we need to find out how many cookies were given to the church. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the total cookies to the church. To calculate this, we multiply the total number of cookies by 1/2:

Cookies given to the church = Total cookies × 1/2
= 1500 × 1/2
= 1500 × 0.5
= 750

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies per person:

Number of people in the church = Cookies given to the church ÷ Number of cookies per person
= 750 ÷ 15
= 50

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's consider the total watermelon as a whole, which we can represent as 1 or 100%. We'll divide it among the family members such that each adult gets twice as much as each kid.

Let's denote the portion of the watermelon each kid gets as x. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, the portion each adult gets is 2x.

The total portion given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each), and the total portion given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each). The sum of these portions should equal the total watermelon, which is 1 or 100%.

We can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 1.

Combine like terms: 6x = 1.

To find the value of x, we'll divide both sides by 6: x = 1/6.

Now that we know each kid gets 1/6 of the watermelon, each adult gets 2x = 2 * (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we'll convert the fraction to a percentage: (1/3) * 100% = 33.33%.

Therefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33.33}$"
"As a time management expert, I'll break down the problem step by step to determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments. The time spent on rounds is 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient, which equals 180 minutes. The time spent on appointments is 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment, which equals 300 minutes.

Now, let's add these two times together: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert this total time from minutes to hours, we'll divide by 60: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we'll subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones has 1 hour left to update his records.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"As a time management expert, I'll break down the problem into manageable intervals to determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake.

First, let's calculate the total time required to make the cake:

- Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
- Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

To convert 180 minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to work backwards to find the latest start time. Let's subtract the total time required from the target time:

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Given the scenario, we have a system of linear equations representing the number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
$$
\frac{8x}{8} = \frac{64}{8}
$$
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"As a cost and revenue expert, I'll break down the calculation into manageable steps to determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session. The studio rental fee is $25, and the cost per student is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a month. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings per month by multiplying the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Given the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha as P and M, respectively.

We know that Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and his total is 64. This can be represented as:

4P = 64

Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and her total is 56. This can be represented as:

7M = 56

To find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha, we can solve these equations.

First, we'll solve for P:

4P = 64
P = 64 / 4
P = 16

Next, we'll solve for M:

7M = 56
M = 56 / 7
M = 8

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:

P - M = 16 - 8
P - M = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the population of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to calculate the number of female porcupines, which is 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population and the number of babies born.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the rectangular prism. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth in this case).

Given the dimensions of the pool: width (w) = 14 feet, length (l) = 25 feet, and depth (h) = 4 feet, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh
V = 14 * 25 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Next, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed:

Gallons = V * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red sticks as R, the number of blue sticks as B, and the number of yellow sticks as Y.

We are given the following information:
1. R = 9 (the number of red sticks)
2. B = R + 5 (the number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks)
3. Y = B - 3 (the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks)

We can substitute the value of R into the second equation to find B:
B = R + 5
B = 9 + 5
B = 14

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the third equation to find Y:
Y = B - 3
Y = 14 - 3
Y = 11

Now that we have the values of B and Y, we can find the total number of sticks by adding R, B, and Y:
Total = R + B + Y
Total = 9 + 14 + 11
Total = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we need to calculate their individual distances and then find the difference.

First, we'll calculate Matteo's distance by multiplying his speed (55 miles per hour) by the time he traveled (4 hours).

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, we'll calculate Shandy's distance by multiplying his speed (45 miles per hour) by the time he traveled (10 hours).

Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we'll find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information provided.

First, we know that half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old. This can be expressed as a fraction: $\frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500$ students over 16.

Next, we're told that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male. This can be calculated as a fraction of a fraction: $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = \frac{1}{8} \times 3000 = 375$ male students over 16.

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students over 16: $1500 - 375 = 1125$ female students over 16.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. This can also be expressed as a fraction: $\frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500$ students under 16.

We're also told that one-half of the students under 16 are male. This can be calculated as a fraction: $\frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750$ male students under 16.

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students under 16: $1500 - 750 = 750$ female students under 16.

Finally, to find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: $1125 + 750 = 1875$.

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run.

10 (Bethany's laps) - 5 (Quinn's laps) = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by determining the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank on the first day.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, we can calculate her contribution as 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B, on the other hand, pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"Given the scenario, we have a power bank that initially loses 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, followed by a 7% loss per hour for the next 3 hours. We are tasked with determining the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.

Let's denote the initial charge as x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%. This can be expressed as:

x - (0.09x * 5) = 0.55x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 0.45x = 0.55x

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save for the down payment, we need to calculate her total weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by her weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate her total weekly earnings. Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. To calculate 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.20:

$10,000 * 0.20 = $2,000

Now, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2,000) by her weekly earnings ($1,000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

$2,000 ÷ $1,000 = 2

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"As an expert in addition, subtraction, and division, I'll break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 × $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 × $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 × $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 × $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these costs together: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so we subtract the total cost of the fruits from his initial amount: $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now, we need to find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Since plums cost $0.25 each, we'll divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum: $0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to calculate the total number of packs given away. Since Anne kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends to find out how many packs each friend received. 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we can find the total number of pieces in 1.3 packs by multiplying 1.3 by 60.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces

Therefore, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"The price of carrots in Mrs. Tatiana's grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = final amount
P = principal (initial) amount
r = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n = number of years

In this case, the principal amount (P) is $120, the annual interest rate (r) is 5% or 0.05, and the number of years (n) is 3.

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120 * 1.157625
A = 139.145

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can start by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

Let's denote the number of pictures per album as x. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can set up the equation:

72 = 8x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 72 / 8
x = 9

Now that we know the number of pictures per album, we can find the number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3x:

Selfies = 3x
= 3(9)
= 27

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 - 3 - 2 = 3 albums. 
The number of portraits is 3x:
Portraits = 3x
= 3(9)
= 27

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 27 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the time James spends reading, we need to establish the ratio of pages read to the time taken. Given that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can express this as a ratio: 3 pages / 10 minutes.

We are told James reads 18 pages in total. To find the time taken, we can set up a proportion using the given ratio and the total number of pages read: 3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 3x = 18 * 10. This simplifies to 3x = 180.

Next, we divide both sides by 3 to isolate x: x = 180 / 3 = 60 minutes.

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"As an expert in addition and subtraction, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Initially, we have 100 guests. To find the number of guests remaining after early checkouts, we subtract 24 from 100: 100 - 24 = 76.

Next, we need to account for the late checkouts. We subtract 15 from the remaining guests: 76 - 15 = 61.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests who checked in during the afternoon. Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

We add these new guests to the remaining count: 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner. We add this to the total: 91 + 7 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"The task at hand is a simple arithmetic problem involving addition and multiplication. To solve it, we need to follow the order of operations, which dictates that we perform multiplication before addition.

First, let's calculate the number of bananas John picked on Friday. He picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 times 4. This can be represented as 3 × 4 = 12.

Now, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The total number of bananas is the sum of 4, 6, and 12. This can be represented as 4 + 6 + 12.

To add these numbers, we can use the commutative property of addition, which states that the order of the numbers does not change the result. So, we can rearrange the numbers to make the calculation easier: 4 + 6 + 12 = (4 + 6) + 12.

Now, we can add 4 and 6, which equals 10. Then, we add 12 to that result, giving us 10 + 12 = 22.

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find out how many of each she is sure to get.

First, let's find the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 × 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Average questions: 36 / 2 = 18
- Difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 × 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 × 18 = 9
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 × 18 = 9

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add up the number of questions she is sure to get:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Now, we can substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"The calculation of total sandwiches consumed by a family in a week is a straightforward arithmetic operation involving addition and multiplication. 

First, we need to determine the total number of sandwiches the family eats per day. This can be calculated by adding the number of sandwiches each family member consumes: 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week, which is 7. Therefore, the calculation is 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"As an expert in addition, subtraction, and multiplication, I can efficiently calculate Suzanne's earnings and the amount she has left.

To find her total earnings, I'll start by calculating the revenue from selling cookies and cupcakes. The revenue from cookies is simply the product of the number of cookies sold and the price per cookie:

80 cookies * $1 each = $80

The revenue from cupcakes is the product of the number of cupcakes sold and the price per cupcake:

60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, I'll add these two revenues together to find the total earnings:

$80 + $240 = $320

Next, I'll calculate the amount Suzanne gave to her sisters. Since she gave each sister $10, the total amount given is:

2 * $10 = $20

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, I'll subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings:

$320 - $20 = $300

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"As a subtraction expert, I can confidently solve this problem by applying the principles of arithmetic operations. To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Total number of eggs = 100
2. Number of eggs found by the Smith twins = 30 * 2 = 60 (using the commutative property of multiplication)
3. Remaining unfound eggs = 10

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate the daily ore production and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

First, let's calculate the daily ore production of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day. 

To find the daily ore production with a steel pickaxe, we need to calculate 50% more than the iron pickaxe production. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. Therefore, the daily ore production with a steel pickaxe is 24 + 12 = 36 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the daily ore production of 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes: 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we can find the total ore production for the month by multiplying the daily production by 30: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month.

The final answer is: 43200"
"Given the problem, we can establish a proportion to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x.

We know that the price of the first package is $3 for 2 sandwiches and the price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. Since the prices are proportional, we can set up the following proportion:

(3/2) = (x/8)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3 * 8 = 2x
24 = 2x

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate x:

x = 24/2
x = 12

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after Tom pays $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom set.

The initial cost of the bedroom set is $3000. After paying $1000, the remaining balance is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment, which is 10% of the remaining balance. To find 10% of a number, we multiply it by 0.10.

Monthly payment = $2000 × 0.10
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.

1. 40% of the red balloons burst:
   Number of red balloons that burst = 0.4 * 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:
   Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
   Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

3. 75% of the blue balloons were added:
   Number of blue balloons added = 0.75 * 8 = 6
   Total number of balloons now = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance of convincing the teacher, and 60% chance of the teacher not giving an extension).

The probability of the third scenario is the product of the probability of the teacher not giving an extension and the probability of Marcus convincing the teacher: 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. 

To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100%. However, since the total probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102%, we need to subtract 100% from 102% to get 2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be greater than 100%. 

To resolve this issue, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get -2% and then add 100% to -2% to get 98%. Alternatively, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get 2% and then subtract 2% from 100% to get 98%. 

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"As a subtraction and division expert, I'll break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to calculate the available seats in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for the reserved seats.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950

Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 ÷ 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, implying that the remaining tickets are for guests.

Therefore, the answer is 5 tickets per graduate.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a ratio between the different sizes of jelly beans. Let's denote the number of small beans as S, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of large beans as L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This can be expressed as:

M = 2L
L = 75

Substituting the value of L into the first equation, we get:

M = 2(75)
M = 150

Now, we are also given that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This can be expressed as:

S = 3M

Substituting the value of M into the equation, we get:

S = 3(150)
S = 450

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"When calculating hourly rates after expenses, it's essential to consider both the total earnings and total expenses. In this scenario, Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, which amounts to a total of $45. However, she also incurs a daily parking expense of $3, totaling $9 over the 3-day period.

To determine her net earnings, we subtract the total expenses from the total earnings: $45 - $9 = $36. 

Now, we need to calculate her total hours worked, which is 6 hours per day for 3 days: 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours.

To find her hourly pay after expenses, we divide the net earnings by the total hours worked: $36 ÷ 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of intervals between the bottles and multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can find the total number of intervals by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 intervals

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of intervals by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

Total time = 8 intervals * 5 seconds/interval = 40 seconds

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

The final answer is: 40"

"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cheese. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and Amor buys 2 pounds. The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 × $11 = $22. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and Amor buys 3 pounds. The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 × $6 = $18.

Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost. $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the time it takes for Jim to repay the loans and lost income, we need to consider the total amount of money he needs to earn, which is the sum of the loans and the lost income.

The total amount of loans he took is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working while in college is $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can use the formula for the present value of an annuity:

PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

where PV is the present value (the amount he needs to earn), PMT is the annual payment (his new income), r is the interest rate (which we'll assume is 0 since we're not considering interest on the loans), and n is the number of years.

However, since we're not considering interest, we can simplify the calculation by dividing the total amount by his annual income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total area of fabric Jim needs, we must first determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is calculated by multiplying the length and width, which gives us 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim requires two identical pieces, we multiply this area by 2 to obtain the total area: 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by calculating the number of letters delivered on Tuesday, which is 17 more than one-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday.

Let's denote the number of letters delivered on Monday as M. We know that M = 425.

One-fifth of M is calculated as M/5. So, one-fifth of 425 is 425/5 = 85.

Now, we need to add 17 to this result to find the number of letters delivered on Tuesday: 85 + 17 = 102.

Next, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday, which is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. Let's denote the number of letters delivered on Tuesday as T. We know that T = 102.

Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 2T, which is 2 * 102 = 204.

Now, we add 5 to this result to find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday: 204 + 5 = 209.

Finally, we need to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday. This is simply the sum of the letters delivered each day: M + T + W, where M = 425, T = 102, and W = 209.

M + T + W = 425 + 102 + 209 = 736.

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"

1. In the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5. This can be represented as a negative number: -$5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.
4. Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.
5. The number of races is 3.
6. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

We know that the total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.

"To calculate the total hours worked by each painter, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's determine the total number of days worked. Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks is equivalent to 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Next, we need to convert the fraction of a day worked by the painters to hours. The painters worked 3/8ths of a day, which can be converted to hours as follows:

$$\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9$$

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to find the total hours worked:

$$9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}$$

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter:

$$\frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{47.25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

"When calculating the increased cost of insurance due to an accident, it's essential to understand the concept of percentage increase. In this case, James' insurance cost is 60% more than the normal cost of $120 per month.

To find the increased cost, we can use the formula:

Increased cost = Normal cost + (Normal cost * Percentage increase)

First, let's calculate the amount of the increase:

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Now, we add this increase to the normal cost:

Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12:

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year for his insurance.

The final answer is: $2304"
"As a laundry load expert, I can tell you that calculating the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is a straightforward process. To determine the total loads, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

The number of movies watched on Saturday is given as 4. Since they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, the number of movies watched on Sunday is 4 / 2 = 2.

In one weekend, the total number of movies watched is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is 4 + 2 = 6.

To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the cumulative sum of stickers collected over the past three years.

Let's start with the initial number of stickers Leo had two years ago: 100.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so we add this to the initial number: 100 + 50 = 150.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. We add this to the total from last year: 150 + 100 = 250.

Now, we calculate the total number of stickers by adding the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To determine how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption of the cats and then divide the total amount of cat food by this value.

First, let's calculate the total daily consumption of the cats. Since Imma feeds her 3 cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food, we multiply the amount of food per meal by the number of meals and the number of cats:

60 grams/meal × 2 meals/day × 3 cats = 360 grams/day

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams):

720 grams ÷ 360 grams/day = 2 days

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as J, the number of slices Becky ate as B, and the number of slices Silvia ate as S.

We know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

We are given the following information:

1. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake: B = J + 3
2. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake: S = 2J
3. Becky ate 10 slices: B = 10
4. The total number of slices eaten by all three is equal to the total number of slices: B + J + S = 32

We can substitute the value of B from equation (3) into equation (1) to get:
10 = J + 3
J = 7

Now, we can substitute the value of J into equation (2) to find S:
S = 2J
S = 2(7)
S = 14

Now that we have the values of J and S, we can substitute them into equation (4) to verify the total number of slices eaten:
B + J + S = 32
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"Given the problem, we can model the situation as a linear equation. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can express Betsy's time as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the expenses into their respective components.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. Therefore, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor prescribed 30 painkillers at $4 each, so the total cost of the painkillers is 30 * $4 = $120.

The cost of the cast is a fixed fee of $200. 

Lastly, we need to calculate the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The final answer is: $482"
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is equivalent to 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

To do this, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by the number of days in the work week: 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is: 320"
"To calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day. 

First, let's start with the number of classes that visited on Monday: 32. 

On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, which is 2 * 32 = 64.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, which is 3 * 32 = 96.

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.

On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"Calculating averages is a fundamental concept in statistics, and I'm happy to help you with this problem. To find the average score, we need to calculate the mean of the given scores.

Given that John scored 100 on his first 3 tests and an 80 on his 4th, we can represent the scores as: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

To find the average, we add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. The sum of the scores is calculated as follows:

100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the sum by the number of tests, which is 4:

380 ÷ 4 = 95

Therefore, the average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which is a decimal representation of 70%. This gives us 20 × 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

Next, we calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 × 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 × 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas eaten: 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"The task at hand involves calculating the total cost of mailing coupons. To approach this problem, I'll break it down into manageable steps.

First, we need to determine the number of small and big coupons. Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. This means he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing each type of coupon. The cost of mailing a small coupon is 5 cents, and the cost of mailing a big coupon is 15 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of mailing the small coupons: 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Similarly, we calculate the total cost of mailing the big coupons: 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of postage is $245.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by determining the initial number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be represented as:

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

The total number of meatballs in the initial order is:

7 × 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches. Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

The new total number of meatball sub sandwiches is:

3 + 3 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, we multiply the total number of sub sandwiches by 4:

6 × 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures and subtract that from the total number of trucks dispatched.

The fraction of trucks with mechanical failures is 1/4. To find the number of trucks with mechanical failures, we multiply the total number of trucks by this fraction:

20 trucks * (1/4) = 20 * 1/4 = 20 * 0.25 = 5 trucks

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons per truck:

15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 15 * 20 = 300 tons

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the buy one pound get one half off promotion, we need to calculate the total cost based on the unit price and the discount applied.

Given that the butter costs $4.00 per pound, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds as follows:

Let's break down the cost into two parts: the full-priced pounds and the discounted pounds.

For every 2 pounds of butter, 1 pound is full-priced at $4.00, and the other pound is half off at $2.00. The total cost for 2 pounds is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the number of full-priced and discounted pounds as follows:

- Full-priced pounds: 3 pounds (since 6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets)
- Discounted pounds: 3 pounds (since 6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets)

The total cost for the full-priced pounds is 3 pounds * $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost for the discounted pounds is 3 pounds * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests attending the party. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, as well as 13 family members. However, 4 people said they could not come. So, the total number of guests attending is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. This is calculated as 41 - 20 = 21.

Now, we can find the cost for the additional guests by multiplying the number of additional guests by the cost per guest: 21 * 6 = $126.

Finally, we add the initial fee to the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost: $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of fractions and their application in real-world scenarios. Maggie and Riza initially had $60 each. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which can be represented as $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 60$. To find the amount she has left, we subtract this from her initial amount: $60 - \frac{1}{4} \cdot 60 = 60 - 15 = 45$.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which can be represented as $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 60$. To find the amount she has left, we subtract this from her initial amount: $60 - \frac{1}{3} \cdot 60 = 60 - 20 = 40$.

Now, to find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + 40 = 85$.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week. We know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

To find the total number of bananas eaten each day, we divide 315 by 7: 

$$\frac{315}{7} = 45$$

Now we know that the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 
Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 
So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"As an expert in multi-step arithmetic, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Jenny buys 15 roses from the florist. Since she buys 15 roses, which is not a multiple of 12, she will buy 1 dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

The cost of 1 dozen roses is $15. The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrives with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price and then add the results together.

"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

Let's break down the events:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. The first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far and then find the difference between the required amount and the saved amount.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find the difference between the required amount (200 toothpicks) and the saved amount (120 toothpicks):

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

To find the number of weeks it will take Melanie to save the remaining toothpicks, we divide the remaining amount by the number of toothpicks saved per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"When analyzing percentage changes across multiple transactions, it's essential to break down the problem step by step. In this scenario, we have a watch with an original price of $2000. Mr. Rogers buys it at 75% of the original price, which is a discount of 25% (100% - 75%). The price he pays is then 75% of $2000, or $1500.

To find the selling price, we apply another percentage change, this time at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid. This is equivalent to a 20% increase (100% + 20%) over the $1500 price. The selling price is therefore 120% of $1500, or $1800.

Now, to determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we calculate the difference between the original price and the selling price: $2000 - $1800 = $200.

To express this as a percentage, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to first convert the time frame into seconds, as the rate of jellyfish creation is given per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"Given that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice as high as Binkie's, we can express this relationship as an equation. Let's denote Binkie's score as B and Frankie's score as F. The equation can be written as:

F = 2B + 15

We are given that Binkie's score is 90. Substituting B = 90 into the equation, we get:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"When calculating the time it takes for an individual to complete a round trip, we must consider the total distance traveled and their speed. In this scenario, James walks a total distance of 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles to the store and back home.

To find the time it took James to complete the round trip, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Given that James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time as follows:

time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour

time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to complete the round trip to the store and back home.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"When it comes to calculating the cost savings of buying bananas in bunches versus individually, I always rely on the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations. In this scenario, we have two distinct scenarios: buying bananas individually and buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas purchased: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Now, let's determine the cost of buying 40 bananas individually: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the cost savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost savings of buying bananas in bunches instead of individually is $2.00."
"Given the scenario, we have a linear system of equations where the total length of the fence is 100 feet, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Then, the amount of fence Harry gets is 'x + 60'.

We can set up the equation based on the total length of the fence: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a ratio of growth per year for the crocodile. 

Let's denote the growth per year as 'g' and the number of years as 'y'. We are given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. This can be represented as:

8 = g * 4

To find the growth per year, we can solve for 'g' by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

g = 8 / 4
g = 2 inches/year

Now, we can use this growth rate to find the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth per year by the number of years:

Total growth in 13 years = g * 13
Total growth in 13 years = 2 * 13
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To calculate Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to determine the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour workday. To approach this, we need to consider the rate at which the farmer produces bales and the rate at which the truck picks them up.

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. Over a 6-hour period, the total number of bales produced is given by the product of the production rate and the time worked: 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

Similarly, the total number of bales picked up by the truck is the product of the pickup rate and the time worked: 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the total number of bales produced: 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales.

Therefore, the number of bales left in the field after a 6-hour workday is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes spent in class and the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes spent in class. John has 6 regular periods and 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes. The total minutes spent in class per day is given by:

6 periods/day × 40 minutes/period + 2 classes × 40 minutes/class
= 240 minutes/day + 80 minutes/day
= 320 minutes/day

Since John attends classes 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is:

320 minutes/day × 5 days/week
= 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to find the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. The total minutes in a week is:

7 days/week × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour
= 1680 minutes/week

So, the minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is:

1/16 × 1680 minutes/week
= 105 minutes/day
= 105 minutes/day × 2 days
= 210 minutes/week

Now, let's add the minutes spent in class and the extra minutes on Saturday and Sunday:

1600 minutes/week + 210 minutes/week
= 1810 minutes/week

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours:

1810 minutes/week ÷ 60 minutes/hour
= 30.17 hours/week

The final answer is: 30.17"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of a geometric sequence, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant, known as the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 2/3, since the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce.

Given that the initial height of the ball is 72 feet (3 stories * 24 feet/story), we can model the height of the ball after each bounce using the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:

an = a1 * r^(n-1)

where a1 is the initial term (72 feet), r is the common ratio (2/3), and n is the term number.

To find the height of the ball after the second bounce, we substitute n = 2 into the formula:

a2 = 72 * (2/3)^(2-1)
= 72 * (2/3)^1
= 72 * 2/3
= 48 feet

Therefore, the height of the ball after the second bounce is 48 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child from feet to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

Now, let's calculate the height of the second child. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

Next, we'll calculate the height of the third child. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

Finally, we'll calculate the height of the fourth child. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we need to calculate the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag. 

First, we divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold (200) by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 × $5 = $1000

Therefore, the total earnings of the apple orchard for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag is $1000.

The final answer is: $1000"
"The art of solving word problems involving reverse percentages is a delicate dance of mathematical manipulation. In this case, we're tasked with determining the original weight of a triceratops that was devoured by a Tyrannosaurus rex, only to be scavenged by velociraptors and finally consumed by a group of Allosaurus.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what the velociraptors had. This implies that the velociraptors had 2 times 270 kilograms, or 2 × 270 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we're told that the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. Since the velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate, we can infer that the T-Rex consumed 2 times 540, or 2 × 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Given that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, we can now calculate the original weight of the triceratops by multiplying the weight eaten by the T-Rex by 2. Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 × 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2160}$"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The total cost to paint the room is $144."
"Given the scenario, we need to calculate the conditional probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, assuming she chooses a can at random from the remaining ones.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, with 3 shaken and 9 unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Then, Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, resulting in 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

To calculate the probability, we need to consider the total number of cans remaining and the number of shaken cans. There are 7 cans in total, with 1 shaken can.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is given by the formula for conditional probability:

P(shaken can | remaining cans) = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of remaining cans)
P(shaken can | remaining cans) = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(shaken can | remaining cans) = (1 / 7) * 100 = 14.29%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"When calculating the distance between two objects moving in opposite directions, we need to consider their relative speed. In this case, the two trains are traveling at a combined speed of 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour.

To find the distance between them after 3 hours, we multiply their combined speed by the time traveled: 90 * 3 = 270 miles.

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

The final answer is: 270"
"To determine the number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available to work between March 1st and April 19th. 

First, let's find the total number of days in this period. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present. However, the problem does not provide the total number of people present, so we will assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since we are assuming that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"Given the problem, we can model the relationships between Jeff, Martha, and Mike as a system of linear equations. Let's denote Jeff's age as J, Martha's age as M, and Mike's age as K.

We are given the following information:

1. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha: J = M + 10
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike: M = K - 4
3. Mike is 24 years old: K = 24

We can substitute the value of K into the second equation to find Martha's age:

M = K - 4
M = 24 - 4
M = 20

Now that we have Martha's age, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find Jeff's age:

J = M + 10
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"When analyzing the time it takes to ride the waterslides, we must consider the fundamental principles of kinematics. The time it takes to travel a certain distance is inversely proportional to the speed at which one is traveling. 

Given the length of the biggest waterslide is 300 feet and the speed is 60 feet/minute, we can calculate the time it takes to ride it using the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

For the second biggest waterslide, with a length of 240 feet and a speed of 80 feet/minute, we apply the same formula:

time = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time between the two slides, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:

time difference = 5 - 3 = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"As a time calculation expert, I can efficiently determine the total time spent on lunch and breaks. 

To calculate the total time spent per day, we need to add the time spent on lunch and breaks. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the miles run by Ahito, we need to first calculate the miles run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can express this relationship as a multiplication problem.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5

Using my expertise in multiplication, I can calculate this product as follows:

Micah's miles = 8 × 3.5
= 8 × (3 + 0.5)
= 8 × 3 + 8 × 0.5
= 24 + 4
= 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
= 52 - (8 + 28)
= 52 - 36
= 16 miles

The final answer is: 16"
"As a seasoned expert in calculating discounts, additions, and subtractions, I'll break down the problem step by step to determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

First, let's calculate the initial balance after the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan with a 20% discount:

Original price of frying pan: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the towels with a 10% discount:

Original price of towels: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The total cost of the new purchases is the sum of the frying pan and towels:

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Finally, let's calculate the new balance on Sheila's credit card:

New balance: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Given the scenario, we have a tank with an unknown number of jellyfish. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the given information. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3) * (x/5) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6 to find the total number of jellyfish.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of proportional relationships and multiplication. Given that Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can express this relationship as a multiplication equation:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we are told that Caroline is three times older than Ben. We can express this relationship as another multiplication equation:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we need to consider her desired retirement income, the number of years she plans to live in retirement, and her current salary.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual retirement income. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000 in retirement. Therefore, her annual retirement income will be:

Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.40 * $100,000
= $40,000

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Next, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of 20% of her annual salary, which is $20,000 per year.

To do this, we can use the formula for compound interest, but since the interest rate is not provided, we will assume a 0% interest rate for simplicity. The formula for the present value of an annuity is:

PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

However, since we are solving for n (the number of years), we can rearrange the formula to solve for n:

n = ln(PMT / (PMT - PV * r)) / ln(1 + r)

where PV is the present value (total savings needed), PMT is the annual payment (annual savings), and r is the interest rate (0% in this case).

However, since we are not considering interest, we can simplify the calculation using the formula:

n = PV / PMT

n = $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

The final answer is: 40"
"When dividing a quantity into equal parts, it's essential to understand the concept of division as a process of repeated subtraction or partitioning. In this scenario, Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts, and then each of those parts must be divided into 5 equal parts.

To find the length of each final cut, we can use the following steps:

1. Divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 100 cm ÷ 4 = 25 cm
2. Since each of the 4 parts must be divided into 5 equal parts, we need to divide the result by 5: 25 cm ÷ 5 = 5 cm

Therefore, the length of each final cut will be 5 cm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. 

First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students: 0.4x = 240, where x is the total number of students.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4: x = 240 / 0.4

x = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"

"The average height of heels at the party can be calculated by finding the mean of the heights of the heels. To do this, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

Let's denote the number of women wearing 4 inch heels as n1 = 3 and the number of women wearing 2 inch heels as n2 = 3. The heights of the heels are h1 = 4 inches and h2 = 2 inches.

The total height of the heels is given by the sum of the heights of the two groups: n1 * h1 + n2 * h2 = 3 * 4 + 3 * 2 = 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height divided by the total number of women, which is n1 + n2 = 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the additional daily mileage Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey within the 30-day constraint, we first calculate the daily mileage requirement.

The total distance to be covered is 9,300 miles, and the available time is 30 days. To find the daily mileage requirement, we divide the total distance by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

However, Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find the additional daily mileage needed, we subtract the planned daily mileage from the required daily mileage:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey within the 30-day constraint.

The final answer is: 60"

"When dealing with temperature changes, it's essential to understand the concept of integer arithmetic. In this case, we're working with a temperature that drops and then increases. 

To find the final temperature, we need to perform two operations: subtracting the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then adding the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop = 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase = 3 degrees Celsius

When subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, the result is a negative number. In this case, 8 is larger than 2, so the result of the subtraction will be negative.

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature - Temperature drop
= 2 - 8
= -6

Now, we add the temperature increase to the result.

Temperature in the morning = -6 + 3
= -3

"When it comes to solving word problems involving subtraction and division, I always start by identifying the key pieces of information provided. In this case, Anna had a budget of $16, spent $4, and had $2 left after buying 2 books. 

To find out how much each book cost, we need to determine the total amount spent on the books. Since Anna had $2 left after buying the books, we can subtract this from her remaining budget to find the total spent on the books.

$16 (initial budget) - $4 (initial expenditure) = $12 (remaining budget)
$12 (remaining budget) - $2 (final amount left) = $10 (total spent on books)

Now, we know that both books cost the same amount of money, so we can divide the total amount spent on the books by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

"To determine the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we need to calculate the 20% increase in enrollment from last year.

The formula to calculate the increase is: Increase = (Percentage Increase / 100) * Previous Year's Enrollment
Increase = (20 / 100) * 50
Increase = 0.20 * 50
Increase = 10

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment to find the current year's enrollment: Current Year's Enrollment = Previous Year's Enrollment + Increase
Current Year's Enrollment = 50 + 10
Current Year's Enrollment = 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60."

"As a seasoned expert in the field of kinematics, I can confidently calculate the total distance John drives to visit his parents.

To determine the total distance, we need to consider the round trip. The one-way distance can be calculated using the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

Given that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to reach his parents, the one-way distance is:

Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:

Total Distance = 140 miles × 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

However, John visits his parents twice a month. To find the total distance driven in a month, we multiply the round-trip distance by 2:

Total Distance per Month = 280 miles × 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives a total of 560 miles per month when visiting his parents.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 4 workers with different production rates: 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour, and 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour. The total production rate of these 4 workers is the sum of their individual rates.

Let's denote the production rate of the fifth worker as x toys per hour. The total production rate of the 4 workers is 2(6) + 2(4) = 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

The total number of toys produced by the 5 workers in 10 hours is the sum of their individual production rates multiplied by the number of hours worked. This can be represented as:

(2(6) + 2(4) + x) * 10 = 400 + 20 (since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(20 + x) * 10 = 420

Expanding the equation, we get:

200 + 10x = 420

Subtracting 200 from both sides, we get:

10x = 220

Dividing both sides by 10, we get:

x = 22

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each of his dogs and add them together.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4} \times 60$. To find the weight of Elijah's first dog, we multiply 60 by $\frac{1}{4}$, which is equivalent to dividing 60 by 4.

$\frac{1}{4} \times 60 = \frac{60}{4} = 15$ pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{2} \times 60$. To find the weight of Elijah's second dog, we multiply 60 by $\frac{1}{2}$, which is equivalent to dividing 60 by 2.

$\frac{1}{2} \times 60 = \frac{60}{2} = 30$ pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is the sum of their individual weights, which is $15 + 30 = 45$ pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

The total weight of all the dogs is the sum of the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog, which is $45 + 60 = 105$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"To solve this problem, we'll work backwards to find the initial number of stickers Seth had. Let's start with the information we know:

Kris had 7 stickers, which is half of what Luis had. Since Kris kept 9 stickers, we can infer that Luis had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Now, we know that Luis had 16 stickers, which is half of what Seth had. To find the initial number of stickers Seth had, we can multiply 16 by 2:

Seth's initial number of stickers = 16 * 2 = 32

Therefore, Seth had 32 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 32"
"As a multiplication and division expert, I can confidently calculate the total number of M&M's and the number of small bags John can make.

To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce. This is a straightforward application of the associative property of multiplication.

Let's break it down:

3 large bags × 10 ounces per bag = 3 × 10 = 30 ounces
30 ounces × 30 M&M's per ounce = 30 × 30 = 900 M&M's

Now, to find the number of small bags, we can divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag.

900 M&M's ÷ 10 M&M's per small bag = 900 ÷ 10 = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth and then divide that by the distance Alfie flies per day.

The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. To find half of this distance, we can use the following division:

$$\frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}$$

Now, we need to divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies per day, which is 400 kilometers.

$$\frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}$$

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the speed of the faster car, we need to establish a proportional relationship between the average car, the 2nd fastest car, and the fastest car.

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the fastest car as C. We are given that A = 120 miles per hour.

We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so B = 5A. Substituting the value of A, we get B = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we are told that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so C = 1.25B. Substituting the value of B, we get C = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the speed of the faster car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote Vince's current age as V. Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can write the equation:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago

We know that Liam is 16 years old now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. We also know that Vince's age two years ago was V - 2. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

14 = 2(V - 2)

To solve for V, we can start by distributing the 2 on the right-hand side of the equation:

14 = 2V - 4

Next, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

14 + 4 = 2V - 4 + 4

This simplifies to:

18 = 2V

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for V:

18 / 2 = 2V / 2

V = 9

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations with four variables. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We are given the following system of equations:

1. A = M (since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can use substitution to solve this system of equations. From equation (3), we can express C in terms of S: C = S + 12.

Substituting this expression for C into equation (2), we get (S + 12) + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, we can express M in terms of A as M = A.

The total number of eggs is 56, so we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the total weight of the crayons is 200 × 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 ÷ 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 × 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we divide by 16, since there are 16 ounces in a pound: 400 ÷ 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the length of the tree that can be used to make logs. Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Next, we determine the number of logs John can make from the usable portion of the tree. Each log is 4 feet long, so we divide the total usable length by the log length.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

Now, we calculate the total number of planks John can make from the logs. Each log yields 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total amount John makes from selling the planks. Each plank sells for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"When solving word problems involving salaries and percentages, it's essential to break down the information provided and apply mathematical operations in a step-by-step manner. In this scenario, we're given the following details:

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. This implies that her brother's monthly salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

To find their combined salary, we add Valerie's and her brother's salaries: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Now, we're told that their mother earns twice their combined salary. Therefore, their mother's monthly salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Given the scenario, we can establish the following variables:

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. We can use the formula time = distance/speed to set up an equation for the time spent on the beach:

2/x = 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x, resulting in:

2 = 40x

Next, we divide both sides by 40 to isolate x:

x = 2/40
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

We can use the same formula time = distance/speed to find the time spent on the sidewalk:

time = 1 / (1/10)
time = 10 minutes

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we need to calculate the remaining amount she needs to save after 8 weeks.

Jane saves $4 per week, so the total amount she has saved in 8 weeks is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find the remaining amount she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 ÷ $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. Multiplying the number of trees by the number of blue birds per tree gives us 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. Multiplying the number of trees by the number of blue birds per tree yields 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

Lastly, there's 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, to find the total number of blue birds, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. According to the problem, if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. Therefore, we can write the equation as x + 24 = 84.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x + 24 - 24 = 84 - 24
x = 60

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60:

60 - 10 = 50

Therefore, Bob will have 50 marbles if he loses 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. 

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40. 

Solving for x, we get:

$$\frac{33 + x}{2} \cdot 5 \geq 40$$

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

$$5(33 + x) \geq 80$$

Distributing the 5:

$$165 + 5x \geq 80$$

Subtracting 165 from both sides:

$$5x \geq -85$$

Dividing both sides by 5:

$$x \geq -17$$

However, since the temperature cannot be negative, we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition. 

The minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"As an expert in addition and multiplication, I can calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks with ease.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, we can multiply the number of cows brought per day by the number of days:

20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

Now, we add the initial number of cows to the number of cows brought in three weeks:

50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. We multiply the number of chickens brought per day by the number of days:

10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

Then, we add the initial number of chickens to the number of chickens brought in three weeks:

20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:

470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"When calculating the cost of individual bagels after a discount, it's essential to consider the total cost of the purchase and the number of items being discounted. In this case, Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, each containing 9 bagels, for a total of 36 bagels.

The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00, so the total cost of 4 packs is 4 × $10.00 = $40.00. To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1 × $40.00 = $4.00. Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the discounted price: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, to find the cost of each individual bagel, we divide the discounted price by the total number of bagels: $36.00 ÷ 36 = $1.00.

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel after the discount is $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem into a system of equations to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

Let's denote the number of scoops of mashed potatoes as S and the number of potatoes as P.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes: S = 23 - 5
2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes: 3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes, and 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops. So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

We can express this relationship as: P = (3/2)S

Now, we can substitute the expression for S from the first equation into the second equation: P = (3/2)(23 - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: P = (3/2)(18)

P = 27

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. This can be calculated as follows:

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 3 * 30 = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. This can be calculated as follows:

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 5 * 30 = 150 eggs

Now, we add the number of eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs:

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:

240 eggs / 12 = 20

Therefore, Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve for the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first determine the total number of non-blue jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of non-blue jellybeans is the sum of green and red jellybeans, which is 17 + 34 = 51.

Now, we subtract the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"The art of multiplication. A fundamental operation that governs the very fabric of our universe. In this case, we're tasked with calculating the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade.

To begin, we need to determine the annual yield of lemons from Tim's 5 trees. This is a straightforward application of the multiplication principle, where we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons each tree produces.

Let's denote the number of trees as T = 5 and the number of lemons per tree as L = 6. The annual yield of lemons can be calculated as:

T × L = 5 × 6 = 30 lemons/year

Now, to find the total number of lemons collected in a decade, we need to multiply the annual yield by the number of years in a decade, which is 10.

Total lemons in a decade = 30 lemons/year × 10 years = 30 × 10 = 300 lemons

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"When dealing with ratios and proportions, it's essential to break down the problem step by step. Given the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, we can represent the total number of passengers as 14 parts, with 9 parts being women.

To find the number of women on the bus, we can set up a proportion: (9/14) * Total Passengers = Number of Women. Plugging in the given total number of passengers (84), we get:

(9/14) * 84 = Number of Women

To solve for the number of women, we can multiply 9 by 84 and then divide by 14:

(9 * 84) / 14 = 54

Now that we know there are 54 women on the bus initially, we need to find out how many remain after 20 women alight. To do this, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the initial number of women:

54 - 20 = 34

Therefore, the number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down the problem into a system of linear equations to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days.

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as S and the number of bouquets sold per day as B. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is 12B.

We are given the following information:

1. The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers and the sunflowers sold from bouquets: S + 12B = 97.
2. The total amount earned from sunflowers per day is $26, and the total amount earned from bouquets per day is $56. Since each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8, we can set up the following equation: 2S + 8B = 26 + 56.

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

S + 12B = 97
2S + 8B = 82

We can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. Multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of S in both equations the same:

2S + 24B = 194

Now, subtract the second equation from this new equation to eliminate S:

(2S + 24B) - (2S + 8B) = 194 - 82
16B = 112

Now, divide by 16 to solve for B:

B = 112 / 16
B = 7

Now that we have the value of B, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for S. Let's use the first equation:

S + 12B = 97
S + 12(7) = 97
S + 84 = 97
S = 97 - 84
S = 13

Now that we have the values of S and B, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying S by 3:

Total sunflowers sold = 3S
= 3(13)
= 39

However, this is the number of sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers. To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to add the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and Faraday sold 7 bouquets per day, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is:

12B = 12(7)
= 84

In 3 days, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets is:

84 * 3
= 252

Now, add the number of sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days:

Total sunflowers sold = 39 + 252
= 291

The final answer is: 291"
"To determine the loss incurred by Adam, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the revenue generated from selling 60% of the inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Adam has $100 to invest, and each rock costs $5. The total cost of the rocks can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Rocks × Cost per Rock
= 20 × $5
= $100

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, we need to find 60% of the total number of rocks. To do this, we multiply the total number of rocks by 0.6:

Number of Rocks Sold = 20 × 0.6
= 12

The revenue generated from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

Revenue = Number of Rocks Sold × Selling Price per Rock
= 12 × $7
= $84

However, Adam still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

Cost of Unsold Rocks = Number of Unsold Rocks × Cost per Rock
= 8 × $5
= $40

The total cost of the rocks is the sum of the cost of the rocks sold and the cost of the unsold rocks:

Total Cost = Cost of Rocks Sold + Cost of Unsold Rocks
= $100 + $40
= $140

To find the loss incurred by Adam, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

Loss = Total Cost - Revenue
= $140 - $84
= $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

Let's start by calculating the number of days it will take Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

1. For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 45/5 = 9 days
2. For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 36/6 = 6 days
3. For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 49/7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the maximum of these values to determine the minimum number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project. The maximum of 9, 6, and 7 is 9.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

To find the number of eggs each child receives, we apply the fundamental principle of division: dividing the total quantity by the number of recipients. In this scenario, we have 36 eggs and 4 children.

36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

This division can be represented as a fraction: 36/4 = 9."

"Calculating average speed is a fundamental concept in kinematics, and it's essential to understand the relationship between distance, time, and velocity. In this scenario, we have two segments of travel: the first segment covers 110 miles in 2 hours, and the second segment covers 140 miles in 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The total distance is the sum of the distances traveled in each segment: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles. The total time is the sum of the times taken for each segment: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula: Average speed = Total distance / Total time. Plugging in the values, we get:

Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed of Sid's travel is 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"When calculating the probability of independent events, it's essential to understand that the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. In this case, we have two lottery tickets with different probabilities of winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which translates to a probability of 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey as C, J, and R, respectively.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. J = C + 5 (Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos)
2. C = 2R (Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey)
3. J + C + R = 3x (the total number of seashells is divided equally among the three people, where x is the number of seashells each person gets)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express J in terms of R:
J = 2R + 5

Now we have two equations with two variables:
1. J = 2R + 5
2. C = 2R

We can substitute C = 2R into the third equation:
J + 2R + R = 3x
Combine like terms:
3R + J = 3x

Substitute J = 2R + 5 into the equation:
3R + 2R + 5 = 3x
Combine like terms:
5R + 5 = 3x

Now we have a single equation with one variable:
5R + 5 = 3x

We know that the total number of seashells is 60, so we can set up the equation:
J + C + R = 60
Substitute J = 2R + 5 and C = 2R:
2R + 5 + 2R + R = 60
Combine like terms:
5R + 5 = 60

Now we have two equations with the same variable R:
1. 5R + 5 = 60
2. 5R + 5 = 3x

We can solve for R by equating the two expressions:
5R + 5 = 60
Subtract 5 from both sides:
5R = 55
Divide both sides by 5:
R = 11

Now that we have the value of R, we can find the value of x:
5R + 5 = 3x
Substitute R = 11:
5(11) + 5 = 3x
55 + 5 = 3x
60 = 3x
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week with ease.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays, we multiply the number of carrots he eats each day (4) by the number of weekdays (5). This is a straightforward application of the multiplication operation.

4 carrots/day × 5 days = 4 × 5 = 20 carrots

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats on the weekend by adding the number of carrots he eats on Saturday (5) and Sunday (5).

5 carrots + 5 carrots = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 20 + 10 = 30 carrots

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song. Since it's 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes, we can express this as an equation:

Let x be the length of the second song. Then, x = 5 + (60% of 5)

To find 60% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (since 60% is equivalent to 0.6 as a decimal).

x = 5 + (5 * 0.6)
x = 5 + 3
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the second song is 8 minutes, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs.

Total time = 5 + 8
Total time = 13 minutes

The final answer is: 13"
"To calculate the total profit, we need to determine the profit from each day and then add them together.

The cost price for each device is $20. Linus bought 2 devices on Monday, so the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply a step-by-step approach to find the length of Carl's cane. 

First, we know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. This gives us a starting point to find Ned's height.

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Next, we are told that Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned. This allows us to find Carl's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. This is a proportional relationship, where the length of the cane is directly proportional to Carl's height.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand by dividing 100% by 20%, which is equivalent to dividing 1 by 0.20. This can be expressed as:

$$\frac{1}{0.20} = 5$$

Therefore, 5 bottles are required to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand.

To find the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by the total number of people:

$$5 \times 2300 = 11500$$

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to determine how many more bottles it needs to produce to meet the required demand. This can be calculated by subtracting the current production from the required production:

$$11500 - 4200 = 7300$$

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7300}$"
"Given that Carla has 8 identical octuplets, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue, we can calculate the number of babies wearing purple and blue as follows:

Number of babies wearing purple: $\frac{3}{4} \cdot 8 = 6$
Number of babies wearing blue: $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 8 = 2$

Now, let's consider the babies wearing bows. We are given that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. Therefore, the number of babies wearing purple and bows is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 6 = 2$, and the number of babies wearing blue and bows is 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the number of babies wearing purple and bows and the number of babies wearing blue and bows, which is $2 + 2 = 4$.

To find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can use the formula for conditional probability:

$P(\text{purple}|\text{bow}) = \frac{P(\text{purple} \cap \text{bow})}{P(\text{bow})}$

We know that $P(\text{purple} \cap \text{bow}) = \frac{2}{8}$ and $P(\text{bow}) = \frac{4}{8}$.

Therefore, $P(\text{purple}|\text{bow}) = \frac{\frac{2}{8}}{\frac{4}{8}} = \frac{1}{2}$

To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

$P(\text{purple}|\text{bow}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 100 = 50\%$

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"As a subtraction expert, I'll break down the problem step by step to find the number of reports received on Wednesday.

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Let's denote the total number of reports received last week as T, the reports received on Monday and Tuesday as M, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday as F.

T = 5168
M = 1907
F = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

M + F = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Next, we'll subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

M + F = 4043

Now, we'll subtract the result from the total number of reports received last week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday.

T - (M + F) = 5168 - 4043
T - (M + F) = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1125}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the initial amount of land Abraham owns, which is 80 square meters.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. To find the area of the land he sold, we can use the formula:

Area = (1/2) × Total Area
Area = (1/2) × 80
Area = 40 square meters

The amount of money he earned from this sale is $50, so we can set up a proportion to find the price per square meter:

Price per square meter = Total Amount / Area
Price per square meter = $50 / 40
Price per square meter = $1.25

Next, Abraham sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. To find the area of the land he sold, we can use the formula:

Area = (1/4) × Total Area
Area = (1/4) × 80
Area = 20 square meters

The amount of money he earned from this sale is $30, so we can set up a proportion to find the price per square meter:

Price per square meter = Total Amount / Area
Price per square meter = $30 / 20
Price per square meter = $1.5

Now, let's find the remaining land:

Remaining land = Total Area - (Area sold in first sale + Area sold in second sale)
Remaining land = 80 - (40 + 20)
Remaining land = 80 - 60
Remaining land = 20 square meters

The remaining land is sold for $3 per square meter. To find the total amount of money he earned from this sale, we can multiply the area by the price per square meter:

Total Amount = Area × Price per square meter
Total Amount = 20 × $3
Total Amount = $60

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. We can add the amounts from each sale:

Total Amount = $50 + $30 + $60
Total Amount = $140

The final answer is: $140"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple linear equation. Let's denote Geb's age as G and Haley's age as H. We are given that G = H - 10 and H = 26.

We can substitute the value of H into the first equation to find G:

G = H - 10
G = 26 - 10
G = 16

Therefore, Geb is 16 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"The problem at hand is a straightforward application of multiplication. To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses in 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply that by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses in 2 days, we simply multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, the correct answer is 12."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs hidden.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs found by each person:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and then multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

First, let's find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6: 400 × 0.6 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the size of the third complex to the combined size of the first two: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, we multiply the total number of apartments by 3: 1040 × 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 × 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"The problem at hand involves an arithmetic sequence where the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree increases by a certain factor each year. Let's break it down:

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): The problem states that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as 'x'. Therefore, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): The tree doesn't produce any fruits in this year.
- Year 6 (10 years old): A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can find the value of 'x' by using the information from the 10-year-old tree: x = 1000.

Now that we know the value of 'x', we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

To find 1/5 of $100, we can use the fraction 1/5, which is equivalent to 0.2 or 20%. We can also express it as a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1 ÷ 5 = 0.2. Multiplying this decimal by $100 gives us the amount: 0.2 × $100 = $20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

We can rewrite the system of equations as:

1) R = 4B
2) B = Y - 7
3) R + B + Y = 37

Substituting equation (1) into equation (3), we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting equation (2) into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's dive into the problem at hand. Given that Ronnie was given $5 and Rissa was given thrice as much, we can express Rissa's initial amount as 3 times Ronnie's amount, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's denote the amount given to their little sister as 'x'. After giving 'x' to their sister, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This can be expressed as the equation (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Given the problem, we have a wall mural with four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. The proportions of red, white, and purple paint are equal, and half the mural is yellow. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of these three colors, the total amount of these colors is 3x. The other half of the mural is yellow, which is also 3x, as the proportions of red, white, and purple paint are equal.

We can set up the equation: 3x + 3x = 12

Combine like terms: 6x = 12

Divide both sides by 6: x = 12 / 6
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total area of Tom's house, we need to break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 

Area of one bedroom = Length × Width
= 20 ft × 12 ft
= 240 sq ft

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

Total area of bedrooms = Number of bedrooms × Area of one bedroom
= 4 × 240 sq ft
= 960 sq ft

Next, we need to find the area of the living room. It's given that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom:

Area of living room = 5 × Area of one bedroom
= 5 × 240 sq ft
= 1200 sq ft

Now, we're given that the rest of the house has an area of 1000 sq ft. To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

Total area of the house = Total area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house
= 960 sq ft + 1200 sq ft + 1000 sq ft
= 3160 sq ft

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"As a specialist in geometric sequences, I can approach this problem by recognizing the pattern of exponential growth. The number of clouds Alice counts each day forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.

Let's denote the number of clouds on Monday as the first term, a = 3. The number of clouds on each subsequent day can be calculated by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio, r = 2.

The sequence of the number of clouds for each day is:
3, 6, 12, 24, 48

To find the total number of clouds counted across all five days, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S_5 = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
= 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
= 3 * (-31) / (-1)
= 93

The final answer is: 93"
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which contains 100 pods. 

To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2, which gives us 20. Therefore, the new box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

"As a financial analyst specializing in cash flow management and bill conversion, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find the number of bills, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill: 1000 ÷ 20 = 50 bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 ÷ 2 = 20 bills. This means he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

To triple his money, he triples the number of bills, resulting in 20 × 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 × 5 = $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.
- In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals, and team B scores 2 goals. In the second half, team A scores 2 goals, and team B scores 8 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 × 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 × 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we need to calculate the total number of students on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

First, let's find the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity, which can be calculated as 12 × (1/3) = 12 × 1/3 = 4.

Next, we'll find the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity, which can be calculated as 12 × (1/4) = 12 × 1/4 = 3.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity: 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on and then express that as a percentage of the total number of teeth James has.

First, let's find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps: 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes by dividing the total number of teeth the dentist fixes by the total number of teeth James has and multiplying by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. This can be done by multiplying 4000 by 2 and then dividing the result by 5.

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5
= 8000 / 5
= 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5
= 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can rewrite the second equation to isolate W:
W = 3(C + 25)

Now we have two equations with the same variable W. We can set them equal to each other to eliminate W:
5(C + 7) = 3(C + 25)

Expanding the left side of the equation:
5C + 35 = 3C + 75

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
2C + 35 = 75

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

"When tackling multi-step word problems involving division, it's essential to break down the problem into manageable parts and apply the correct mathematical operations. In this case, we're given that Bob has $27,000 to distribute among 3 schools to buy books, and he can purchase 100 books for $500.

To find the total number of books Bob can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of 100 books.

Total books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27,000 / $500
Total books = 54

Now, to determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

Therefore, Bob can buy 18 books per school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"As a sequential problem-solving expert, I'll break down the events step by step to determine the total number of apples Newton brought home.

Let's denote the initial number of apples as A. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, so A = 2.

1. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. The total number of apples is A + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7.

2. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. The total number of apples is 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.

3. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. The total number of apples is 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"The task at hand is a straightforward multiplication problem. To calculate the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, let's determine the number of bags of coal Ali ordered. We can do this by dividing the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight per bag (50 kg).

850 kg ÷ 50 kg/bag = 17 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

Total cost = Number of bags × Cost per bag
= 17 bags × $18/bag
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend consumes 6 slices, and there are 6 friends. Multiplying these values yields 6 × 6 = 36 slices. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: 36 ÷ 12 = 3. Therefore, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends. Multiplying these values gives 4 × 6 = 24 slices. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: 24 ÷ 8 = 3. Consequently, Kate needs 3 pepperoni pizzas.

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas: 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, let's consider the miles Sam ran on the days he ran 3 miles each: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This is a simple multiplication problem, where we multiply the number of miles (3) by the number of days (3). The calculation is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

Next, we consider the miles Sam ran on the days he ran 5 miles each: Tuesday and Thursday. This is another multiplication problem, where we multiply the number of miles (5) by the number of days (2). The calculation is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days to find the total miles Sam ran this week: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. He constructs 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, which translates to a rate of 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, resulting in a melting rate of 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowball construction, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 

$$\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5}$$

This means Jay effectively builds 1/5 snowballs per minute.

To determine the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs, we use the formula:

Time = Number of snowballs / Rate

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"When solving age problems, it's essential to identify the key information and apply the correct mathematical operations. In this case, we're given that John is 28 years old and that 20 years ago, he was twice as old as Jim.

Let's denote Jim's age 20 years ago as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can express this relationship as an equation: x * 2 = 8, where 8 represents John's age 20 years ago.

Solving for 'x', we get x = 8 / 2 = 4. This means Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

"The art of addition is a fundamental aspect of mathematics, and I'm delighted to apply my expertise to this problem. 

To determine the total number of slices eaten, we need to calculate the sum of the slices each person consumed. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we add up the number of slices each person ate: 
1 + 2 + 3 = 6

The total number of slices eaten is 6."
"To solve this problem, we need to track the inventory of bandages over the three days. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100 bandages) and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

Therefore, the initial number of bandages is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"

"As a compensation specialist, I can calculate Jen's total earnings for April based on her hourly rate and attendance bonus.

To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and attendance bonus. 

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April.
Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours.
Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus:
Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days.
Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"
"To calculate Jason's earnings, we need to multiply the amount earned for each task by the frequency of the task and then add up the results.

For laundry, Jason earns $3.00 once, so the calculation is $3.00 * 1 = $3.00.

For cleaning the room, Jason earns $1.50 once, so the calculation is $1.50 * 1 = $1.50.

For taking the trash out, Jason earns $0.75 twice, so the calculation is $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.

For emptying the dishwasher, Jason earns $0.50 six times, so the calculation is $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

"When calculating the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can express this relationship as a multiplication factor: 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood in one shark.

To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we apply the multiplication principle, which states that when we multiply a number by a factor, we are essentially adding the base number a certain number of times equal to the factor. In this case, we multiply 120 gallons by 10, which can be expressed as 120 × 10.

Using the multiplication algorithm, we can calculate this product as 120 × 10 = 1200 gallons.

"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we have the initial 50 people who entered in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 

Next, we need to determine the number of people who entered for lunch. It's stated that twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.

Finally, we have the evening crowd, which is 3 times the number of people who entered in the morning, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time:
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150

To simplify the calculation, we can group the numbers:
(50 + 40) + 80 + 150
= 90 + 80 + 150

"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, we can express this as 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, which can be represented as 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. Additionally, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10. Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 20 + 10 = 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 40 + 50 = 90

To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees:
Total number of trees = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 30 + 90 = 120

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we can calculate one-third of the total number of fish.

One-third of 66 = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = \frac{66}{3} = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = \frac{5 \times 44}{11} = \frac{220}{11} = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes.

Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish with blue stripes = 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"As an expert in addition, subtraction, and division, I can provide a precise calculation for the problem.

Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so we can calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors from the palettes as 2 × 4 = 8.

She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, so the total number of eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets is 3 × 6 = 18.

To find the initial total number of eyeshadow colors, we add the number of colors from the palettes and the makeup sets: 8 + 18 = 26.

When her sister steals one palette, Amy loses 4 eyeshadow colors, so we subtract 4 from the initial total: 26 - 4 = 22.

Next, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. To find half of 6, we divide 6 by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3. So, she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of the total shells.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Next, we find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share.

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Now, we calculate the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we subtract the total shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Given that she sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for, we can express this as a multiplication problem.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8. This can be represented as:

Selling price = (11/8) × 72

To simplify this, we can multiply the numerator (11) by 72 and keep the denominator (8) the same:

Selling price = (11 × 72) / 8

Now, we perform the multiplication in the numerator:

11 × 72 = 792

So, the expression becomes:

Selling price = 792 / 8

To find the selling price, we divide 792 by 8:

Selling price = 99

Now that we have the selling price, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.  To find the total amount of water removed on the low setting, we multiply the daily removal rate by the number of days it was used: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day.  To find the total amount of water removed on the medium setting, we multiply the daily removal rate by the number of days it was used: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.  To find the total amount of water removed on the high setting, we multiply the daily removal rate by the number of days it was used: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amounts of water removed on each setting to find the overall total: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.

"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to determine the total interest he owes his sister and subtract the total amount he has already paid in the first 11 months.

The interest rate is 2% per annum, and the principal amount is $300. Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, we can calculate the total interest as follows:

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
= $300 × 0.02 × 1 (since 11 months is approximately 11/12 of a year)
= $6

However, since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, we need to calculate the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months:

Total Amount Paid = $25 × 11
= $275

Now, we can calculate the remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month:

Remaining Amount = Principal + Interest - Total Amount Paid
= $300 + $6 - $275

"Given the jar's dimensions and the jelly bean's volume, we can calculate the total volume of the jar.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

However, since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to account for this packing efficiency when calculating the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar. 

Effective volume = Total volume * Packing efficiency
Effective volume = 540 * 0.8
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the effective volume by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Effective volume / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step, applying the principles of arithmetic operations involving fractions and percentages.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, increasing the total to 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. To find 3/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 3/4:

40 × (3/4) = (40 × 3) / 4 = 120 / 4 = 30

So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop, increasing the total to 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. To find the new total, we multiply the current total by 2:

2 × 90 = 180

Now, we need to find the number of spaces left on the bus. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are currently 180 people on the bus. To find the number of spaces left, we subtract the current total from the capacity:

200 - 180 = 20

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years. The initial cost of one visit is $2, and Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. Therefore, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the next 3 years after the price increase. The cost of one visit has increased by 150%, which means the new cost is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

To find the total cost for all visits, we add the cost of the first 5 years and the cost of the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the number of groups that can be formed from the total number of students and then multiply that by the time each group takes to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades with 10 students in each grade, resulting in a total of 4 * 10 = 40 students.

To find the number of groups of 8 students that can be formed from 40 students, we perform the division: 40 ÷ 8 = 5.

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for all students to try the escape room.

The final answer is: 225"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can efficiently calculate the total cost for the items John manufactured for Ali.

"Given a board that is 40 feet long, we can set up a linear equation to find the length of the longer piece. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we can establish a ratio of seasoning to meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound, we can set up a proportion to find the total seasoning needed for 80 meatballs.

Let's denote the total seasoning needed as S and the total pounds of meat as M. We know that 2 tablespoons of seasoning are used for every 1 pound of meat, which yields 16 meatballs. We want to find the amount of seasoning needed for 80 meatballs.

We can set up the proportion as follows:

(2 tablespoons / 1 pound) = (S / M)
(2 / 1) = (S / M)

We are given that Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs, and we know that 16 meatballs are obtained from each pound of meat. To find the total pounds of meat needed, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

M = 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs/pound
M = 5 pounds

Now that we know the total pounds of meat needed, we can substitute this value into the proportion and solve for S:

(2 / 1) = (S / 5)
S = (2 / 1) * 5
S = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"When it comes to calculating the amount of fabric needed for curtains, it's essential to consider the total width of the windows and then multiply that by the desired factor. In this case, we have five windows, each with a width of 35 inches.

To find the total width of the windows, we apply the distributive property of multiplication, which states that the product of a number and a sum is equal to the sum of the products. In this instance, we can multiply the width of one window by the number of windows.

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window × 5 windows
Total width of windows = 35 × 5
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Now, we need to determine the amount of fabric required, which is equal to two times the total width of the windows. This can be expressed as a multiplication problem.

Fabric needed = 2 × (35 × 5)
Fabric needed = 2 × 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric for the new curtains."
"When calculating the cost of a call with varying rates, it's essential to break down the call duration into segments based on the rate change. In this scenario, the rate changes from $0.25 per minute to $0.2 per minute after 16 minutes.

To find the total cost, we'll calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes separately.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is given by the product of the rate and the duration: $0.25 * 16 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes (36 - 16 = 20), the cost is given by the product of the new rate and the duration: $0.2 * 20 = $4.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for the two segments: $4 + $4 = $8.

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate the amount of rain on Monday and then find twice that amount, and add 1 inch to it.

The amount of rain on Monday is given as 2 inches. To find twice this amount, we multiply 2 by 2, which is 2 × 2 = 4 inches.

Now, we add 1 inch to this result: 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B.

From the problem statement, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is 10. This can be expressed as:

C + B = 10

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

C + B = 10
B = 3C - 2

We can substitute the expression for B from the second equation into the first equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"As a seasoned expert in calculating discounts, addition, and multiplication, I'll break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

Now, let's apply the discount to the manicure and pedicure prices. The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28. The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the nail art. Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can efficiently calculate the total number of magazines Susan receives every year.

To find the total number of magazines, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up. 

First, let's calculate the number of issues from the first 3 magazines: 3 × 12 = 36.

Next, we have the second magazine, which sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 × 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines every year.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K, the number of paintings Shelley has as S, and the number of paintings Samantha has as A.

From the given information, we can write the following equations:

1. A = S - 12 (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)
2. S = K + 8 (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
3. A = 27 (Samantha has 27 paintings)

We can substitute the value of A from equation 3 into equation 1 to get:

27 = S - 12

Solving for S, we get:

S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can substitute this value into equation 2 to solve for K:

39 = K + 8

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

K = 39 - 8
K = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the final price of the toy after the discounts, we need to apply the percentage changes sequentially.

First, we calculate the price increase in December: 
Price increase = 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January:
Price decrease = 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"As a seasoned expert in calculating discounts and sums, I'll break down the problem step by step.

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. This can be represented as:

Total amount from standard rate lessons = 4 × $80
= $320

Next, we need to calculate the total amount from the reduced rate lessons. Charlie has 2 lessons at 75% of his standard rate (since he reduces his rate by 25%). This can be represented as:

Reduced rate = $80 × (1 - 0.25)
= $80 × 0.75
= $60 per hour

Now, we can calculate the total amount from the reduced rate lessons:

Total amount from reduced rate lessons = 2 × $60
= $120

Finally, we add the total amount from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day = $320 + $120
= $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To calculate the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
\[
\frac{630}{9} = 70
\]

The mean score is 70."
"To find the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we need to determine the difference between the original amount and the amount she has left. 

Let's denote the original amount of pomelos as O and the amount she gave away as G. We know that O = 20. After giving away some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, which can be expressed as:

O - G = (1/4)O

Substituting the value of O, we get:

20 - G = (1/4)(20)

To find the value of G, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides:

-G = (1/4)(20) - 20

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

-G = 5 - 20

-G = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for G, we get:

G = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the number of apples Walter ate. To do this, we'll calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Next, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we need to find 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To do this, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.

25% = 25/100 = 0.25

Now, we can multiply 0.25 by 36 to find the number of apples Walter gave to his sister.

0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples.

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

Therefore, Walter received $81.

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine what 1 quarter of the novels is and then multiply it by 4. 

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters, we can find 1 quarter by dividing 9 by 3.

"When calculating the percentage of distance covered, it's essential to consider the total distance and the distance traveled. In this case, the total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. 

To find the distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael traveled for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, the percentage of the distance covered by Michael is 60%."
"To determine the initial number of grapes, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is x - 36 / 12. However, since the number of pies must be a whole number, we can set up the equation x - 36 / 12 = n, where n is the number of pies.

Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 12n. The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 12n (by their mother). We know that the total number of grapes used is equal to the initial number of grapes minus the remaining grapes, which is x - (x - 36) = 36.

Simplifying the equation, we get x - x + 36 = 36, which simplifies to 36 = 36. However, this is not a useful equation, as it does not involve the variable x. We need to consider the fact that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make pies.

Let's re-examine the situation. The number of pies made by the mother is x - 36 / 12. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by the mother is 12(x - 36 / 12). The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 12(x - 36 / 12).

We know that the total number of grapes used is equal to the initial number of grapes minus the remaining grapes, which is x - (x - 36). However, this is not a useful equation, as it does not involve the variable x. We need to consider the fact that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make pies.

Let's re-examine the situation. The number of pies made by the mother is x - 36 / 12. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by the mother is 12(x - 36 / 12). The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 12(x - 36 / 12).

However, we can simplify the situation by considering the fact that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make pies. This means that the number of grapes used by the mother is equal to the number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used their grapes, which is x - 36.

Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies made by the mother is (x - 36) / 12. The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + (x - 36) (by their mother).

We can set up the equation 36 + (x - 36) = x, since the total number of grapes used is equal to the initial number of grapes. Solving for x, we get x = 72.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"

"To determine the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of the macaroni and cheese per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To determine the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time available for cleaning and the total time required to clean all classrooms.

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task, working 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total time available for cleaning is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

The time required to clean all 80 classrooms is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. 
To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Rose's profit, we need to determine the total cost and total revenue of the eggs.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen, we can multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen:

Total Cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen
Total Cost = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Next, we need to find the total revenue. Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. To determine the total revenue, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Now, we can calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of sets by the price per set:

Total Revenue = 20 sets * $1/set
Total Revenue = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

Therefore, the profit is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the number of white hats, we need to calculate the proportion of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, we can express this as 50% or 0.5. The remaining hats are 100% - 50% = 50% or 0.5.

Now, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining hats, which can be expressed as 3/5 * 0.5. To calculate this, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 0.5, resulting in (3 * 0.5) / (5 * 0.5) = 1.5 / 2.5 = 0.6 or 60%.

The number of white hats is the remaining percentage after subtracting the red and blue hats from 100%. Since 50% are red and 60% are blue, the percentage of white hats is 100% - 50% - 60% = 100% - 110% (which is incorrect) or 100% - 110% = -10% (which is also incorrect). However, we can calculate the percentage of white hats by subtracting the sum of the percentages of red and blue hats from 100% and then converting the result to a positive percentage. 

100% - 50% - 60% = -10% is incorrect, but we can express the sum of the percentages of red and blue hats as 50% + 60% = 110%, which is greater than 100%. To find the percentage of white hats, we can subtract 100% from 110% and then convert the result to a positive percentage. 

110% - 100% = 10%. To convert this to a positive percentage, we can express it as 10% or 0.1. However, this is the percentage of the remaining hats that are blue, not the percentage of white hats. To find the percentage of white hats, we need to subtract the percentage of blue hats from 50% (the percentage of remaining hats). 

50% - 10% = 40%. This is the percentage of white hats. To find the number of white hats, we can multiply this percentage by the total number of hats.

Number of white hats = 40% * 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"As a seasoned expert in subtraction, division, and unit conversion, I'll tackle this problem with precision.

To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first apply the discount to the original price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and the discount is $3.00. 

Subtracting the discount from the original price yields:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the discounted price to cents, as the cost per stick will be expressed in this unit. To do this, we multiply the price by 100:

$15.00 × 100 = 1500 cents

Next, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks per bag to find the cost per stick:

1500 ÷ 30 = 50 cents

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to calculate her total required score and then subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to get right to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, we can set up the equation:

Total questions needed right = 0.7 * Total questions
Total questions needed right = 0.7 * 110
Total questions needed right = 77

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 
60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right:

Questions needed right on the second test = Total questions needed right - Questions right on the first test
Questions needed right on the second test = 77 - 42
Questions needed right on the second test = 35

1. B = 5S - 4
2. S + B = 116

We can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

S + (5S - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6S - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6S = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

S = 20

Now that we know S, we can find B:

B = 5S - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"The calculation of total points scored by Ara in four years involves a straightforward application of the multiplication principle. To find the total points, we need to multiply the number of games played each year by the score per game and then multiply the result by the number of years.

Given:
- Number of games per year: 40
- Score per game: 21 points
- Number of years: 4

To calculate the total points scored in one year, we multiply the number of games by the score per game: 40 games/year * 21 points/game = 840 points/year.

Now, to find the total points scored in four years, we multiply the total points scored in one year by the number of years: 840 points/year * 4 years = 3360 points.

Therefore, the total number of points scored by Ara in four years is 3360.

The final answer is: 3360"
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to apply set theory principles and basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, Brendan had a set of marbles, denoted as M, with a cardinality of 10 (|M| = 10). When he dropped half of the marbles, the resulting set, M', had a cardinality of |M'| = |M| / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.

Subsequently, Brendan found a set of marbles, denoted as F, with a cardinality of |F| = 3. The union of M' and F, denoted as M'' = M' ∪ F, has a cardinality of |M''| = |M'| + |F| = 5 + 3 = 8.

However, upon inspection, Brendan discovered that one of the marbles in M'' was not a marble, but a bead, denoted as B. To find the number of marbles in M'', we need to subtract the cardinality of the set containing the bead, |B| = 1, from the cardinality of M'': |M''| - |B| = 8 - 1 = 7.

Therefore, the number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we can break down the problem into a series of ratios and proportions.

Let's start by establishing the given ratios:

- For every 25 telephone calls, 1 person comes into the car dealership.
- For every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car.

We can represent these ratios as fractions:

25 telephone calls / 1 person = 1/25
2 customers / 1 car sale = 2/1

To find the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers (since 15 cars will be sold, and for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold), we can set up a proportion:

25 telephone calls / 1 person = x telephone calls / 30 people

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

25 * 30 = 1 * x
750 = x

However, this is the number of people needed to come into the car dealership. Since we want to find the number of telephone calls needed, we can use the first ratio:

25 telephone calls / 1 person = x telephone calls / 30 people

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

25 * 30 = 1 * x
750 = x

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the total number of flashlights. Since there are 4 people in the household, and each person has a flashlight, the total number of flashlights is simply 4.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and we know that half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each.

To find the number of small candles, we multiply the number of rooms with small candles (4) by the number of candles per room (4): 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.

To find the number of medium candles, we multiply the number of rooms with medium candles (4) by the number of candles per room (5): 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, we add the total number of small candles and medium candles to find the total number of candles: 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 + 36 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Division is a fundamental operation in mathematics, and I'm delighted to apply my expertise to this problem. When dividing a total quantity by a divisor, we're essentially finding the quotient, which represents the number of equal parts or groups.

In this scenario, Mitchell has 110 chips, and he wants to distribute them equally among 5 family members. To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to perform the division operation.

The formula for division is:

Quotient = Dividend ÷ Divisor

In this case, the dividend is 110 (the total number of chips), and the divisor is 5 (the number of family members).

110 ÷ 5 = 22

Therefore, each family member will receive 22 chips."
"When calculating the total time it takes to solve a Rubik's cube, we need to consider the varying rates at which each side is completed. 

Let's break it down:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

To find the total time, we add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The final answer is: 30"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a ratio of robots to helmets to footballs. Let's denote the number of footballs as F, the number of helmets as H, and the number of robots as R. We are given that H = 20 and R = H/2.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can express this relationship as H = F/2. Substituting the given value of H, we get 20 = F/2, which implies F = 40.

Now, we can find the number of robots using the relationship R = H/2. Substituting the value of H, we get R = 20/2 = 10.

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week, we need to calculate the rate at which he handles calls per day and then multiply it by the number of working days.

First, let's convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is $\frac{15}{60} = 0.25$ hours.

Now, we can calculate the number of calls Tim deals with in a day by dividing the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: $\frac{6 \text{ hours}}{0.25 \text{ hours per call}} = 24$ calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: $24 \text{ calls per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 120$ calls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"When it comes to calculating time differences for multiple items, it's essential to consider the time it takes for each item to complete a task. In this case, we're dealing with the drying time of varnish on paintings.

Given that the old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, and the new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, we can calculate the total time it takes for each type of varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, the total time is 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, the total time is 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in time between the old varnish and the new varnish, we subtract the total time for the old varnish from the total time for the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we must first calculate the water required for each type of plant. 

For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water, we have 4 × 0.5 cups. Multiplying a whole number by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying the whole number by the numerator and then dividing by the denominator. Therefore, 4 × 0.5 = (4 × 5) / 10 = 20 / 10 = 2 cups.

For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water, we simply have 8 × 1 = 8 cups.

The remaining 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, which is equivalent to 0.25 cups. To find the total water needed for these plants, we multiply 8 by 0.25: 8 × 0.25 = (8 × 25) / 100 = 200 / 100 = 2 cups.

Now, we add the water needed for each type of plant: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Given the scenario, we have a total distance of 200 yards that Phineas needs to cover, with half of the distance being on land and the other half in water. To determine the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we can break down the problem into two segments.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover the land segment. Since Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, the time taken to cover 100 yards on land is given by:

t_land = d_land / v_land
= 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
= 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cover the water segment. Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time taken to cover 100 yards in water is:

t_water = d_water / v_water
= 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
= 10 minutes

The total time taken to return home is the sum of the time taken for the land and water segments:

t_total = t_land + t_water
= 5 minutes + 10 minutes
= 15 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks, we need to perform a simple division and multiplication operation.

First, we need to find the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs to buy. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of popsicle sticks required by the number of sticks per box.

Number of popsicle sticks needed: 56
Popsicle sticks per box: 8
Number of boxes needed: 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Now, we need to find the total cost of the boxes. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the cost per box.

Cost per box: $2.00
Number of boxes needed: 7
Total cost: 7 × $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"The cost of a phone plan can be broken down into the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones. Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, its cost is 2x.

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{20}{2}
$$

$$
x = 10
$$

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

$$
4x = 4 \times 10
$$

$$
4x = 40
$$

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 40
$$

$$
\text{Total cost} = 60
$$

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine Derrick's daily revenue, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the price of each doughnut.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, we can convert this to a more manageable unit by multiplying 10 by 12, which is the number of doughnuts in a dozen. This gives us 10 × 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. To find the daily revenue, we multiply the number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut: 120 × $2 = $240.

Now, we need to calculate the total revenue for June, which has 30 days. To do this, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in June: $240 × 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To determine the number of days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day.

The total number of photos is 210, and she can upload 6 batches per day, with each batch containing 7 photos. 

To find the number of photos she can upload per day, we multiply the number of batches by the number of photos per batch: 6 * 7 = 42.

Now, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day: 210 ÷ 42 = 5.

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos.

The final answer is: 5"
"The task at hand is a straightforward calculation involving multiplication and addition. To determine the total cost of dry-cleaning Alicia's clothes for 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost for each item and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the cost for each item per week:

- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00
- Pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 per pair = $16.00

Now, let's add the costs for each item to find the total weekly cost: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To determine the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at a rate of 375 WPM.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 hours

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days. On the first day, he saw 50 people. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is the sum of these three values: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of people Conor saw on the remaining four days. Since there are 7 days in a week and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, we can calculate the total number of people he saw on these days by multiplying the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, we can find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week by adding the number of people he saw on the first three days to the number of people he saw on the remaining four days: 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. This is our initial rate.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased three times the initial amount, so we multiply the initial rate by 3: 20 * 3 = 60 kernels popped.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased four times the initial rate, so we multiply the initial rate by 4: 20 * 4 = 80 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so we multiply the previous rate by 0.5: 80 * 0.5 = 40 kernels popped.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so we multiply the final rate by 0.25: 40 * 0.25 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To tackle this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, let's establish the ratio of lemons to lemon juice. We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. This gives us a ratio of lemons to juice as 6:1.

Since Tim wants to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of juice, we need to find the total amount of juice required for the regular lemonade. 

Total juice for regular lemonade = 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the regular lemonade. Using the ratio of 6 lemons to 1 cup of juice, we can set up a proportion to find the number of lemons needed.

Let x be the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade. Then, we have the proportion:

6 lemons / 1 cup = x lemons / 4 cups

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6 * 4 = x * 1
24 = x

So, 24 lemons are needed for the regular lemonade.

Next, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice. 

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups

Using the same ratio of 6 lemons to 1 cup of juice, we can find the number of lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade.

Let y be the number of lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade. Then, we have the proportion:

6 lemons / 1 cup = y lemons / 2 cups

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6 * 2 = y * 1
12 = y

So, 12 lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade.

Now, we can find the total number of lemons needed by adding the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade and the extra tart lemonade.

Total lemons needed = 24 lemons (for the regular lemonade) + 12 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) = 36 lemons

The final answer is: 36"
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can confidently calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week.

To find the total daily consumption, we need to multiply the number of dogs by their respective food consumption rates. 

For German Shepherds: 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 3 × 5 = 15 kg/day
For Bulldogs: 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 2 × 3 = 6 kg/day

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds to get the total daily consumption: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day × 7 days = 21 × 7 = 147 kg

The final answer is: 147"
"The problem at hand is a straightforward application of arithmetic operations. We have two types of animals: 2-legged and 4-legged. To find the total number of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from each category and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both categories: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs.

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is: 40"
"Given the problem, we can represent the number of blue blocks as B, the number of yellow blocks as Y, and the number of red blocks as R. We are given that B = 4 and Y = 2B. The total number of blocks is 32, so we can write the equation:

B + Y + R = 32

Substituting Y = 2B into the equation, we get:

B + 2B + R = 32

Combine like terms:

3B + R = 32

We are also given that B = 4, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

3(4) + R = 32

Simplify the equation:

12 + R = 32

Subtract 12 from both sides:

R = 20

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"When analyzing the problem, we need to consider the concept of relative position and the fact that Elvis's initial westward journey and subsequent eastward journey cancel out the initial displacement. 

The distance traveled west is given by the product of the speed and time: $18 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}$. 

The distance traveled east is given by the product of the speed and time: $18 \text{ mph} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 144 \text{ miles}$.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we can see that the eastward journey completely offsets the westward journey, resulting in no net displacement from his original position. 

Therefore, Elvis is now at the same location as his house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. We'll apply the given depreciation rates to find the value after each year.

Year 1 depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2 depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3 depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"Given the problem, we have a bag of Starbursts candies with a total of 232 pieces. We are provided with the following information:

- The number of red candies is 54.
- The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies.
- The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies.

To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it is 2 * 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies by adding these values together: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to consider the expenses for the hotel and the bus trips separately.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the hotel. The cost of one night at the hotel is $80, and Helen stayed for 3 nights. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights:

Total cost of the hotel = $80 * 3
= $240

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the bus trips. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel. To find 10% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.1:

Cost of one bus trip = 0.1 * $80
= $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, we multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips:

Total cost of the bus trips = $8 * 7
= $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the total cost of Helen's trip:

Total cost of the hotel and bus travels = $240 + $56
= $296

The final answer is: $296"
"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first calculate the number of marbles Dallas received. Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can find his initial marble count by adding the marbles he dropped back to his current count.

Dallas's initial marble count = 21 (current marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles) = 25

Now, we know that Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins. To find out how many marbles Darla received, we subtract Dallas's initial marble count from the total number of marbles given.

Marbles given to Darla = Total marbles given - Dallas's initial marble count
= 52 - 25
= 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."

"Calculating the force required to move a vehicle involves determining the total weight of the vehicle, its contents, and then finding a percentage of that weight. In this scenario, we have a car weighing 1200 pounds, luggage weighing 250 pounds, and two children weighing 75 pounds each.

First, we calculate the total weight by adding the individual weights together:

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

To find the force required to move the car, we need to calculate 1% of the total weight. This can be done by multiplying the total weight by 0.01 (since 1% is equivalent to 0.01 as a decimal).

Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs and subtract it from the initial amount ordered.

First, let's calculate the daily feed consumption of the pigs. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the daily consumption per pig is 4 × 2 = 8 pounds. With 5 pigs, the total daily consumption is 5 × 8 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the weekly consumption. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is 40 × 7 = 280 pounds.

To find the amount of feed left, we subtract the weekly consumption from the initial amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we must first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Let's denote the number of guests as G, the number of hot dogs each guest will eat as H, and the number of hot dogs John already has as X. We know that G = 20, H = 2, and X = 4.

The total number of hot dogs required is the product of the number of guests and the number of hot dogs each guest will eat, minus the number of hot dogs John already has:

Total hot dogs required = (G * H) - X
= (20 * 2) - 4
= 40 - 4
= 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. This can be calculated by dividing the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:

Number of packs required = Total hot dogs required / Number of hot dogs per pack
= 36 / 6
= 6

To find the total amount John needs to spend, we multiply the number of packs required by the cost per pack:

Total amount = Number of packs required * Cost per pack
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is: $12"

"As a seasoned expert in time calculations and arithmetic operations, I'll break down the problem into manageable parts to arrive at the solution.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation per week. Since Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, the daily meditation time is 15 + 15 = 30 minutes. To find the weekly meditation time, we multiply this by 7 days: 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Next, we'll calculate the total time spent on yoga per week. Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes, 5 days a week. Therefore, the weekly yoga time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, we add the weekly meditation and yoga times to find the total time spent on these activities per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the relationships between the heights of Jackie, Anne, and Albert.

Let's denote Jackie's height before summer as J, Albert's height as A, and Anne's height as N. We are given that Albert is 36"" tall, so A = 36.

We also know that Anne is twice the size of Albert, so N = 2A = 2(36) = 72.

Furthermore, we are told that Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so J + 2 = N, or J + 2 = 72.

To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to solve for J. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get J = 72 - 2 = 70.

However, we also know that Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so her current height is J + 3 = 70 + 3 = 73"". But we are asked for her height before summer, which is J = 70"".

"As a seasoned expert in calculating discounts and applying percentage reductions, I'll break down the problem step by step to determine the total amount Jake spends at the store.

First, let's consider the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake takes advantage of the buy one get one 50% off deal, he pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other at 50% off. The cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 \* 0.5 = $4. Therefore, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 \* 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate was on vacation.

Let's denote the number of holes dug per day as \(h_d = 6\) and the number of days Nate was on vacation as \(d_v = 14\). The total number of holes dug during this period is given by the product of these two values:

\[ \text{Total holes dug} = h_d \times d_v = 6 \times 14 = 84 \]

However, since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to account for these additional holes. Let's denote the number of nights as \(n\), which is equal to the number of days Nate was on vacation. The total number of holes dug at night is:

\[ \text{Holes dug at night} = h_d \times n = 6 \times 14 = 84 \]

The total number of holes is the sum of the holes dug during the day and the holes dug at night:

\[ \text{Total holes} = \text{Holes dug during the day} + \text{Holes dug at night} = 84 + 84 = 168 \]

Now, let's calculate the net number of holes filled per day. Nate fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. The net number of holes filled per day is:

\[ \text{Net holes filled per day} = h_f - h_d = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

To find the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

\[ \text{Days to fill holes} = \frac{\text{Total holes}}{\text{Net holes filled per day}} = \frac{168}{3} = 56 \]

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7:

\[ \text{Weeks to fill holes} = \frac{\text{Days to fill holes}}{7} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can express this relationship as a fraction.

"Let's analyze the situation using a system of linear equations. We can represent the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes as variables: t, b, and p, respectively.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: t = 16 / 2 = 8. However, this is not the case, as we will see later. Let's represent the correct number of test tubes as t. We also know that Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: t = p + 2.

We are given that Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: b = 7. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29: t + b + p = 29.

Now, let's rewrite the system of linear equations:

1) t = p + 2
2) t + b + p = 29
3) b = 7

We can substitute the value of b from equation 3 into equation 2:

We are given that Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: b = 7. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29: t + b + p = 29.

Now, let's rewrite the system of linear equations:

1) t = p + 2
2) t + b + p = 29
3) b = 7

We can substitute the value of b from equation 3 into equation 2:

t + 7 + p = 29

Now, we can rewrite equation 1 as p = t - 2 and substitute it into the previous equation:

t + 7 + (t - 2) = 29

Combine like terms:

2t + 5 = 29

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2t = 24

"The problem at hand involves calculating the number of screws James will have left over after assembling the tables. To begin, we need to determine the total number of screws required for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg necessitates 2 screws. Therefore, the total number of screws needed for each table is 4 x 2 = 8.

To find the total number of screws required for all 4 tables, we multiply the number of screws needed for one table by the total number of tables: 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

Now, we need to subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws James has to find out how many he will have left over: 40 - 32 = 8.

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: 8"
"The problem at hand is a simple arithmetic operation involving multiplication and addition. Given that there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and the second basket contains twice as many eggs, we can express this relationship as a multiplication problem.

Let's denote the number of eggs in the first basket as x = 10. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs, we can express the number of eggs in the second basket as 2x. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs in both baskets by adding the number of eggs in each basket: x + 2x = 3x.

Substituting the value of x, which is 10, we get: 3x = 3(10) = 30.

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to add their individual contributions. 

Let's start by identifying the amounts raised by each girl. Alexandra raises $430. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, we can express Kim's contribution as $430 + $320 = $750.

Similarly, Sarah raises $300, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Therefore, Maryam's contribution is $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we can add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Given the scenario, we have a classic problem involving ratios and proportions. Let's denote the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile as V and the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as A.

We are given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so we can express this as a ratio:

A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, which means if Aaron runs 1 mile, Vanessa runs 2 miles. Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2A = 16

Substituting A = 2V into the equation, we get:

2(2V) = 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4V = 16

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

V = 4

Therefore, it takes Vanessa 4 minutes to run 1 mile. Since she ran 4 miles, the total time it took her to complete her part of the race is:

4 miles * 4 minutes/mile = 16 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. This is a straightforward multiplication problem, as we need 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

Now, we need to subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has from the total amount required. This is a simple subtraction problem.

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"As a multiplication and addition expert, I can confidently calculate the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant.

To determine the daily revenue, we need to calculate the total cost of meals and wine. Since they order 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, the total daily revenue is:

2 * $5 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $10 + $5 = $15

Now, we need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days they are open, which is 2 days a week.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open
= $15 * 2
= $30

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes $30 per week.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling all 50 watermelons at a 25% profit margin.

Given that the cost price of 50 watermelons is $80, we can calculate the selling price of 50 watermelons using the formula:

Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Margin * Cost Price)
Selling Price = $80 + (0.25 * $80)
Selling Price = $80 + $20
Selling Price = $100

Now, to find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons
Selling Price per Watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling Price per Watermelon = $2

Therefore, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between John, James, and Dora. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

However, we are given that John had James when he was 19. This implies that the time that has passed since then is 18 - 19 = -1 year. Since age cannot be negative, this indicates an inconsistency in the given information. We cannot proceed with the problem as stated.

However, if we assume the problem is asking for the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we can ignore the inconsistency and proceed. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so his current age is 32. In 3 years, his age will be 32 + 3 = 35 years.

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in an hour, we need to calculate their respective peeling rates and then find the difference.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1/3 oranges per minute. In 60 minutes, her total peeling rate is (1/3) * 60 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1/4 oranges per minute. In 60 minutes, her total peeling rate is (1/4) * 60 = 15 oranges.

The difference in their peeling rates is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"When it comes to calculating costs, I always start by determining the discounted price of the item. In this case, Mark needs a new radiator, and he's fortunate to find it at a junk shop with an 80% discount. To calculate the discounted price, I'll multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

The original price of the radiator is $400. To find the discount amount, I'll multiply $400 by 0.8 (which represents 80% as a decimal). This gives me a discount of $320. Subtracting the discount from the original price yields the discounted price: $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator, and the mechanic works for 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour. To find the labor cost, I'll multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours worked: 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

Now, I'll add the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost to determine the total cost. This is a straightforward calculation: $80 (discounted price) + $150 (labor cost) = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Given the problem, we have a system of two linear equations:

C + W = 20  ... (Equation 1)
2C + 4W = 70  ... (Equation 2)

We can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply Equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of C in both equations equal:

2C + 2W = 40  ... (Equation 3)

Now, we can subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2 to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W - 2W = 30
0 = 30

This is a contradiction, which means that the system of equations has no solution. However, this is not possible in this context, as we know that there are 20 animals on the farm.

Let's try the substitution method instead. We can solve Equation 1 for W:

W = 20 - C

Substituting this expression for W into Equation 2, we get:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expanding the equation, we get:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"When dividing a quantity into equal parts, it's essential to consider the total number of slices and the number of people sharing them. In this scenario, we have 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, resulting in a total of 7 × 8 = 56 slices.

To determine the number of slices each person can have, we apply the fundamental principle of division: dividing the total number of slices by the number of people. In this case, we have 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends). Therefore, we divide 56 slices by 4 people.

56 ÷ 4 = 14

This result indicates that each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
