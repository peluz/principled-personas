"Let's figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has a different flower in their house: carnations, daffodils, tulips, and lilies. They also play different instruments: guitar, piano, percussion, and flute.

We know the flutist lives in the second house. That's like the middle house.

We also know that the pianist lives two houses away from the flutist. Since the flutist is in the second house, the pianist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the other houses. The person with tulips lives next to the guitarist. The guitarist can't be in the first house because the flutist is in the second house. So, the guitarist must be in the third house.

If the guitarist is in the third house, then the person with tulips must be in the first house. That's because they live next to each other.

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in the first house.

The answer is (C)."

So, let's try again. If the person eating oranges is in house 2, the swimmer and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively. The person eating mangos must be in house 1, and the soccer player must be in house 3. This fits all the clues!

From clue "
"Let's figure out where the person wearing sandals lives.

We know that there are two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. Each person has different shoes, likes a different kind of book, and drives a different kind of car.

Here are the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

Let's think about it. If the person who drives a convertible lives left of the history book buff, that means the history book buff can't live in the first house. The history book buff has to live in the second house because the person in the first house would be to the left of the history book buff, but the history book buff is to the left of the convertible driver.

Now, the person who wears boots can't live in the first house. So, the person who wears boots must live in the second house. But we already know the history book buff lives in the second house, so the person who wears boots can't live there. This means the person who wears boots must live in the first house.

The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house because the history book buff lives in the second house. And the person who wears sandals must live in the second house.

So, the person who wears sandals lives in house 2. The correct answer is (B)."
"Let's figure out where the basketball player lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. We also know that each person likes a different kind of book and plays a different sport.

From the clues, we know:

1. The swimmer lives next to the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player doesn't live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives next to the history book buff.
4. The swimmer doesn't live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

Let's start with clue 5. We know the golfer lives in the first house.

Now, let's think about clue 1. If the swimmer lives next to the romance book lover, and the golfer is in the first house, the swimmer must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the third house. But wait, clue 4 says the swimmer doesn't live in the third house. This means our first guess was wrong.

So, let's try again. If the golfer is in the first house, the swimmer must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

Now we have: 
- Golfer in the first house
- ? in the second house
- Swimmer in the third house
- Romance book lover in the fourth house

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives next to the history book buff. Since the romance book lover is in the fourth house, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the mystery book reader must be in the second house.

Now we have: 
- Golfer in the first house
- Mystery book reader in the second house
- Swimmer in the third house
- Romance book lover in the fourth house

From clue 2, we know the basketball player doesn't live in the fourth house. Since the romance book lover is in the fourth house, the basketball player must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the golfer, so the basketball player must be in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

We know there are 4 houses, and each person likes a different kind of book. We also know that each person is wearing different shoes.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels doesn't live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the person wearing sandals must live in the first house, and the romance book lover must live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person wearing high heels doesn't live in the fourth house. But we already know the person wearing high heels can't live in the second house, so the person wearing high heels must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers. If the person wearing loafers lived in the first house, the history book buff would live in the fourth house, but we already know the person wearing high heels lives in the fourth house. So, the person wearing loafers must live in the third house, but we already know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. This means the person wearing loafers must live in the first house, and the history book buff must live in the fourth house.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: person wearing loafers
- House 2: romance book lover, person wearing sandals
- House 3: mystery book reader
- House 4: person wearing high heels, history book buff

The mystery book reader lives in the third house, so the answer is:

"Let's figure out where the person with a computer lives.

Now, we know that the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. This means the person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

So, the order is: green, gameboy, computer, yellow, ... .

The person who has a phone must live in the last house, because the other three houses are already taken.

So, the order is: green, gameboy, computer, yellow, phone.

The person with a computer lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

From clue 9, we know the tea drinker doesn't live in the second house. Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the tea drinker must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the person who likes green. Clue 2 says the coffee drinker lives two houses to the right of the person who likes white. We don't know who likes white yet, but we'll come back to that later.

From clue 6, we know the mystery book reader doesn't live in the fourth house. Since the tea drinker lives in the fourth house, the mystery book reader must live in the second house. But wait, we already said the romance book lover lives in the second house! This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader are the same person.

Now, let's go back to the person who likes white. Clue 1 says there are two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker. Since the coffee drinker lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

So, we have the following information:
- House 1: History book buff (likes white)
- House 2: Romance book lover (mystery book reader)
- House 3: Root beer lover (likes red)
- House 4: Tea drinker (likes green)

The coffee drinker lives in the third house.

We know there are two houses. One is house number 1 and the other is house number 2. There are two people living in these houses. Each person has something different: a phone or a radio, a favorite book, something they ate for lunch, a favorite color, and a pet.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes fantasy books lives in house number 1.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives next to the person who has a radio. Since the fantasy book person lives in house number 1, the person who likes green must live in house number 2.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes fish does not live in house number 1. So, the person who likes fish must live in house number 2.

From clue 4, we know the person who had pizza does not live in house number 1. So, the person who had pizza must live in house number 2.

Now we have this:
- House 1: Radio, Fantasy book, ?, ?, ?
- House 2: ?, ?, Fish, Pizza, Green, ?

The person in house number 1 must like yellow because the person in house number 2 likes green. The person in house number 1 must have a phone because the person in house number 2 has a radio. The person in house number 1 must have eaten spaghetti because the person in house number 2 had pizza.

So, the person in house number 1 must be a cat lover. The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 9, the root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes blue is in the fifth house, the romance book lover must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is occupied by the person who likes milk. Therefore, the person who likes milk and the romance book lover must be in the third and fourth houses, respectively, and the person who likes blue must be in the fifth house is incorrect.

"Let's figure out where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a person with different pets, drinks, eats different fruits, and plays different musical instruments. We also have some clues to help us solve the puzzle.

From clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. This is a big clue!

From clue 13, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, the cat lover must be the person who is eating kiwis.

From clue 12, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who likes milk does not live in the first house, and from clue 7, we know the person who likes milk does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, we know the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must live in the third and fourth houses.

From clue 1, we know the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the fish enthusiast must live in the third house, and the cellist must live in the fourth house.

From clue 11, we know the person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating apples must live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the flutist lives in the first house. Since the cat lover lives in the first house, the flutist must be the cat lover, which we already determined is the person who is eating kiwis.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. The answer is:

"Let's figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

We know there are four houses with different people in each one. Each person has a different pet and a different kind of flower in their house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the person with tulips lives next to the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house.

From clue 2, the person with daffodils doesn't live in the second house. So, the person with daffodils must live in either the first or the fourth house. But the cat lover is already in the first house, so the person with daffodils must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, there's one house between the person who owns horses and the person with carnations. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the person with carnations must be in the fourth house (because there's one house between the person with carnations and the person who owns horses).

From clue 4, the person with lilies lives to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person with carnations is in the fourth house, the person with lilies must be in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Person with lilies
- House 4: Person with carnations

The only person left is the fish enthusiast. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house.

The answer is (A)."

We also know that the person with boots doesn't live in house 2. But we don't know if they live in house 1 or not. 

The clue that says the person with horses and the person with a radio live next to each other is important. This means they can't be in the same house. 

So, the person with horses and the person with a radio must be in houses 1 and 2, but not in the same house. 

Since the person with a phone lives in house 1, the person with horses and the radio must live in house 2. 

Now, we know the person with boots can't live in house 2, so they must live in house 1. But we already know the person in house 1 has a phone, so the person in house 1 can't be wearing boots. 

This means the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels. 

So, the person with high heels lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."

From clue 6"
"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. The people like different sports and have different pets.

Clue 1: The basketball player doesn't live in the first house.
Clue 2: The basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer.
Clue 3: The baseball player lives in the second house.
Clue 4: The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner.
Clue 5: The bird keeper doesn't live in the first house.
Clue 6: The tennis player lives to the left of the cat lover.
Clue 7: The bird keeper doesn't live in the third house.

Let's start with Clue 3. The baseball player lives in the second house. 

Now, let's think about Clue 1. The basketball player can't live in the first house. So, the basketball player must live in the third or fourth house.

From Clue 2, we know the basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer. This means the swimmer must live in the fourth house, and the basketball player must live in the third house.

Now, let's think about Clue 4. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the baseball player is in the second house, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the bird keeper doesn't live in the first house. So, the bird keeper must live in the second, third, or fourth house.

From Clue 7, we know the bird keeper doesn't live in the third house. So, the bird keeper must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 6, we know the tennis player lives to the left of the cat lover. Since the basketball player is in the third house, the tennis player must be in the second house, and the cat lover must be in the third house. But we already know the bird keeper can't live in the third house, and the cat lover must be to the right of the tennis player. This means the bird keeper must be in the second house.

The bird keeper lives in the second house. The correct answer is (A)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have three houses with people who like different colors, drive different cars, play different instruments, have different devices, and play different sports. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who has a computer. This means the computer person can't be in the last house.

From clue 6, we know that the person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. This means the sedan person and gameboy person are next to each other.

Let's put the sedan and SUV people next to each other. If we put them in the first and second houses, the gameboy person would be in the second house, and the sedan person would be in the first house. But then the sedan person would be to the left of the SUV person, which is correct.

So, the sedan person is in the first house, and the SUV person is in the second house. The gameboy person is in the second house, so the computer person must be in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that there is one house between the baseball player and the person who likes blue. This means the baseball player can't be in the first house, so the baseball player is in the third house. The person who likes blue is in the second house.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know there are 5 houses with different people, each with a different device, pet, and lunch. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 11, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the fish enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 10, we know the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 9, we know the person who had stew lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 8, we know the bird keeper lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 7, we know there is one house between the bird keeper and the person who has a television.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 6, we know the person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who has a gameboy.

From clue 4, we know the person who had pizza does not live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the cat lover lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.

Now, let's put the information together:

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast, so the fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
- The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who had stew, so the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the fifth house, and the person who has a computer lives in the third house.

Now, let's think about the cat lover. We know the cat lover lives in the third house, but the person who has a computer also lives in the third house. This means the person who has a computer is not the cat lover. The cat lover lives in the third house, so the person who has a computer lives in the second house is not possible because the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in the third house is not possible because the cat lover lives in the third house. The only option left is the person who has a computer lives in the fourth house is not possible because the person who had stew lives in the fourth house. So the person who has a computer lives in the fifth house is not possible because the person who ate fried rice lives in the fifth house.

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person has a different pet, plays a different sport, and has a different kind of car.

Clue 1: The person who drives a truck lives to the right of the basketball player.

Clue 2: The cricketer lives in the first house.

Clue 3: The cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan.

Clue 4: The person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Since the cricketer lives in the first house, the person who owns horses must live in the second house, and the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house. This is because the person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Now, let's think about the cat lover. The cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house, the cat lover must live in the third house too.

So, the order of the houses is:

Since the person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes milk, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house, and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house.

However, this contradicts clue 2, which says the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

"Let's figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

We know the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house. That's clue 9.

From clue 8, we know the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 

So, if the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, the person who drives a truck must live in the third house because the basketball player lives to the left of the truck driver.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person likes a different drink: water, coffee, or tea. Each person has a different kind of car: a convertible, a sedan, or a minivan. Each person likes a different kind of book: fantasy, science fiction, or history. And each person is eating a different kind of fruit: apples, oranges, or mangos.

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house. That's a good start!

The person eating apples lives to the left of the person driving a minivan. Since the tea drinker is in the first house, the person eating apples must be in the first house too. But that can't be right, because the person eating apples can't live in the same house as the tea drinker. So, the person eating apples must be in the second house, and the person driving a minivan must be in the third house.

Now, let's think about the person driving a convertible. This person lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. But we already know the person driving a minivan is in the third house, so the person driving a convertible can't be in the third house. That means the person driving a convertible must be in the second house.

We also know there's one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. Since the person driving a convertible is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, or the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house. But if the fantasy book enthusiast is in the third house, the coffee drinker would be in the second house, and that's not possible because the person driving a convertible is in the second house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, and the coffee drinker must be in the second house.

The person eating oranges can't live in the second house, so the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

So, the correct order is:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Fantasy book enthusiast, Eating apples
- House 2: Coffee drinker, ?, Eating mangos
- House 3: Minivan, Science fiction book fanatic, Eating oranges

The person eating mangos is in the second house, so the coffee drinker must be in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in the second house. This matches what we just figured out.

From Clue 1, we also know the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

From Clue 3, we know the person who likes white doesn't live in the third house. Since the person who likes red lives in the second house and the mystery book reader lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or third house. But we already know the person who likes red lives in the second house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

"Let's figure out where the person with the computer lives.

We know two things:

1. The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person with a television lives in the first house.

Since the person with a television lives in the first house, that means the person in the first house does not have lilies. And the person with lilies does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.

Now, we know the person in the first house has a television, and the person in the second house has lilies. We also know that the person in the first house does not have lilies, so they must have a computer.

So, the person with the computer lives in the first house. The answer is:

(B) 1"
"Let's figure out where the percussionist lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses like different things.

- One person had pizza and one had spaghetti.
- One person has tulips and one has daffodils.
- One person likes history books and one likes science fiction books.
- One person likes baseball and one likes golf.
- One person plays the guitar and one plays the drums (percussion).

We have some clues to help us figure it out:

1. The person who likes science fiction books lives to the left of the person who likes golf.
2. The person who had pizza and the person who likes history books live next to each other.
3. The person who plays the guitar lives to the right of the person who has daffodils.

Let's start with Clue 1. This means the person who likes golf can't be in the left house. So, the person who likes golf must be in the right house.

Now, let's look at Clue 2. The person who had pizza and the person who likes history books live next to each other. Since the person who likes golf is in the right house, the person who had pizza and the person who likes history books must be in the left house.

From Clue 3, we know the person who plays the guitar lives to the right of the person who has daffodils. Since the person who had pizza and the person who likes history books are in the left house, the person who has daffodils must be in the right house. This means the person who plays the guitar is in the left house.

Now we have the following information:
- Left house: Person who had pizza, history book buff, and guitarist
- Right house: Person who had spaghetti, person with daffodils, and golfer

The only remaining characteristics are the sport and the musical instrument for the person in the right house. Since the person in the right house is a golfer, the person in the right house must be the percussionist (because the person in the left house is a guitarist).

The answer is (B) 1."

"Let's figure out where the violinist lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The person in the left house has a bouquet of lilies, and the person in the right house has a bouquet of roses.

"Let's figure out where the person with loafers lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses are different. They ate different foods, like stew and spaghetti. They like different colors, like white and red. They drink different things, like water and milk. They like different sports, like baseball and swimming. And they wear different shoes, like running shoes and loafers.

From the clues, we know:

1. The person with running shoes doesn't live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

Let's think about this. If the person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti, and the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other, then the person who likes white must live in the first house. The person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

Now, we know the person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the person who only drinks water must also live in the second house.

The person who wears running shoes can't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house. This means the person who wears loafers must live in the first house.

"Let's figure out where the person who loves root beer lives.

2. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who loves root beer.
3. The person who loves root beer does not live in the second house.
4. The person who eats oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's think about this step by step. We know the person who loves root beer can't live in the second house (clue 3). So, they must live in either the first or the third house.

Now, let's think about the person who drinks water. They live to the right of the person who loves root beer (clue 2). If the person who loves root beer lives in the first house, the person who drinks water must live in the third house. But if the person who loves root beer lives in the third house, the person who drinks water would have to live in the third house too, which doesn't make sense because the person who drinks water lives to the right of the person who loves root beer. So, the person who loves root beer must live in the first house.

The final order is: 
- House 1: person who loves root beer
- House 2: person who eats oranges (because the person who eats oranges can't live in the second house, and the person who drinks water can't live in the second house either)
- House 3: person who drinks water and eats mangos (because the person who drinks coffee lives to the left of the person who eats mangos, and the person who drinks coffee must live in the second house)

The answer is (B) 1."

Now, let's think about the possible arrangements.

If the person who likes green lives in the first house, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue, then the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

If the person who had pizza lives in the second house, then the person who likes blue must live in the third house.

If the person who likes blue lives in the third house, then the person who owns an SUV must live in the third house.

If the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, then the person who drives a truck must live in the first house.

If the person who drives a truck lives in the first house, then the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

If the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, then the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

If the person who had pizza lives in the second house, then the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house.

If the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, then the person who likes red must live in the third house.

If the person who likes red lives in the third house, then the person who is eating grapes must live in the fourth house.

If the person who is eating grapes lives in the fourth house, then the person who ate fried rice must live in the fourth house.

If the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house, then the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the first house.

If the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house, then the person who is eating apples must live in the second house.

If the person who is eating apples lives in the second house, then the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the second house.

We know two things:
- The person who eats grapes doesn't live in the first house.
- The baseball player lives in the second house.
- The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

So, the person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible. 

Now, we know the person who eats grapes can't live in the first house, and they can't live in the second house because the second house is already taken by the baseball player. So, the person who eats grapes must live in the first house.

The only sport left is cricket, and the only car left is the minivan. So, the person in the second house is a cricket player and drives a minivan.

The person eating mangos is the only one left, and since the person eating grapes lives in the first house, the person eating mangos must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person is eating a different kind of fruit: apples, kiwis, and oranges. And each person likes a different color: blue, white, and green.

1. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

Let's start with clue 2. We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. 

Now, let's look at clue 3. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who is eating oranges must live in the second house.

So, the order is: 1 (apples), 2 (oranges), 3 (kiwis).

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the person who likes white must live in the third house.

Clue 2 says the soccer player lives to the left of the mystery book reader. This means the soccer player can't be in house 2 because the mystery book reader would be in house 1, and that's not right.

Clue 3 says the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader. This means the person with a gameboy can't be in house 2 because the mystery book reader would be in house 1, and that's not right.

Clue 5: The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's start with Clue 3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the truck and sedan are next to each other. Since the cat lover does not live in the second house, the truck and sedan must be in the first and second houses.

Now, let's look at Clue 4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the fish enthusiast and dog owner are next to each other. Since the truck and sedan are in the first and second houses, the fish enthusiast and dog owner must be in the second and third houses.

But wait! Clue 2 says there are two houses between the person who drives a truck and the dog owner. If the truck is in the first house and the dog owner is in the third house, there is only one house between them. This is not correct.

So, the truck and sedan must be in the first and second houses, but the fish enthusiast and dog owner cannot be in the second and third houses. This means the fish enthusiast and dog owner must be in the third and fourth houses.

Now, let's look at Clue 1. The person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the minivan must be in the fourth house.

So, the order is: 1 (truck), 2 (sedan), 3 (fish enthusiast), 4 (dog owner).

From clue 1, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house. This means the tennis player lives in the third house.

However, we already know the tennis player lives in the third house, so the person who is eating oranges must live in the third house, which is a contradiction. This means our previous assumption that the tennis player lives in the third house is incorrect.

From clue 4, we know the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic must live in the second and fourth houses, or the first and third houses.

From clue 1, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house. This means the tennis player lives in the third house.

However, we already know the cricketer lives in the third house, so the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which is a contradiction. This means our previous assumption that the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house is incorrect.

From clue 12, we know there is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the person who likes green lives in the third house. However, we already know the cricketer lives in the third house, so the person who likes green must live in the second house.

From clue "
"Let's figure out where the dog owner lives.

We know two things:

1. The person who plays the cello lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a dog does not live in the first house.

Since the person with the cello lives next to the person with the gameboy, and they live next to each other, one of them must live in the first house and the other in the second house. The person with the cello must live in the first house because the person with the dog does not live in the first house.

So, the person with the cello lives in the first house, and the person with the gameboy lives in the second house.

Now, we know the person with the dog does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.

The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure out where the person who owns an SUV lives.

We know that there are 4 houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has a different kind of car and a different device.

Clue 1: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

Clue 2: The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.

Clue 3: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.

Clue 4: The person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who has a gameboy.

Clue 5: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.

Clue 6: The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.

Let's think about it. If the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house, then the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house (because the person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who has a gameboy).

Now, let's think about the person who has a phone. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who owns an SUV lives to the right of the person who has a phone.

We know the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house, so the person who has a computer must live in the second house.

The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. If the person who has a computer lives in the second house, then the person who has a phone must live in the third house. But we already know the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house. This means the person who has a phone and the person who has a gameboy cannot live in the third house at the same time.

So, the person who has a phone must live in the second house. The person who owns an SUV lives to the right of the person who has a phone, so the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's solve the problem together.

We have 5 houses with different people, and each person has a different flower and a different device. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 3, we know the person with a vase of tulips lives in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a computer lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement.

From clue 4, we know the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio.

From clue 5, we know the person with a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the person with a computer in the second house and the person with a vase of tulips in the third house.

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
2 - Computer
3 - Tulips
?

Since the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement, and the person with a vase of tulips lives in the third house, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the first house, and the person with a carnations arrangement must live in the fourth house.

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
1 - Rose
2 - Computer
3 - Tulips
4 - Carnations
?

From clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives directly left of the person with a television. Since the person with a computer lives in the second house, the person with a phone must live in the first house, and the person with a television must live in the fifth house.

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
1 - Phone
2 - Computer
3 - Tulips
4 - Carnations
5 - Television

From clue 1, we know the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with a phone. Since the person with a phone lives in the first house, the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the fifth house.

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
1 - Phone
2 - Computer
3 - Tulips
4 - Carnations
5 - Lilies

From clue 4, we know the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio.

"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses have different things: one likes root beer, one likes water; one eats a banana, one eats grapes; one had pizza, one had stew; one drives a truck, one drives a minivan; and one has a radio, one has a computer.

We have some clues to help us:

1. The person with a radio and the person with a truck live next to each other.
2. The person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. The person who likes root beer does not live in the first house.
4. The person who eats grapes lives to the left of the person with a computer.

Let's think about it. If the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza, and the person with a radio and the person with a truck live next to each other, then the person with a radio must live in the first house, and the person with a truck must live in the second house.

Now, let's think about the person who eats grapes. We know they live to the left of the person with a computer. This means the person with a computer must live in the second house, and the person who eats grapes must live in the first house.

But wait, we know the person who likes root beer does not live in the first house. This means the person who eats grapes (and lives in the first house) must like root beer.

Now, let's think about the person who had pizza. We know they live to the right of the person with a radio, and the person with a radio lives in the first house. This means the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

So, the person who had pizza lives in the second house, which is house number 2. The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have 4 houses with different people living in them. Each person ate something different for lunch: grilled cheese, spaghetti, pizza, and fried rice. Each person likes a different color: red, yellow, white, and green. Each person drinks something different: coffee, tea, water, and milk.

From Clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in the first house.

From Clue 5, the tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

From Clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must live in the third and fourth houses, or vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house, which is already occupied by the person who likes milk. This is a contradiction, so the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must live in the third and fourth houses, respectively.

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house. From Clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the tea drinker, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live in the third and fourth houses, respectively, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the second house is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. This leaves the third house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live in the third and fourth houses, respectively. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house is not possible because the tea drinker lives in the first house. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who likes yellow is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the basketball player lives in the fourth house.

From clue 12, we know the person with loafers lives in the third house. And from clue 11, we know the cricketer lives in the third house. But from clue 5, we also know the person with a radio lives in the third house. This means the third house is taken by the person with loafers, the cricketer, and the person with a radio.

From clue 4, we know the person with boots lives left of the person with a computer. This means the person with boots must live in the first or second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes milk lives right of the person who likes tea. And from clue 10, we know the person who likes milk lives left of the person with high heels. This means the person who likes milk must live in the second house, and the person with high heels must live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the person who had stew lives left of the person who ate fried rice. And from clue 13, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives left of the person who had stew. This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
4. The person who likes milk lives in the second house.

1. One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
2. One person likes science fiction books and the other likes history books.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure out where the dog owner lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses have different pets, favorite colors, favorite drinks, and musical instruments.

Clue 1: The pianist lives in the first house.

Clue 2: The person who likes root beer lives to the right of the person who owns horses.

Clue 3: The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

Let's think about it. If the pianist lives in the first house, that means the person who owns horses also lives in the first house. The person who likes white does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. But wait, the pianist already lives in the first house, so the person who likes white must live in the first house too. This can't be right because the person who likes white does not live in the second house.

So, the person who likes white must live in the first house, and the pianist must be the person who likes white. But this is not possible because the pianist is already in the first house. This means our first thought was wrong.

Let's try again. If the pianist lives in the first house, the person who owns horses must live in the first house. The person who likes white does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. But we already know the pianist lives in the first house, so the person who likes white must live in the first house. This is a problem.

Let's think about it again. If the pianist lives in the first house, the person who owns horses must live in the first house. The person who likes white does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. But we already know the pianist lives in the first house. This means the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we know the person who likes white lives in the second house. The person who owns horses must live in the first house because the pianist lives in the first house. The person who likes root beer lives to the right of the person who owns horses, so they must live in the second house.

We have the following information:
- The pianist lives in the first house.
- The person who owns horses lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who likes root beer lives in the second house.

The only person left is the dog owner. Since the person who owns horses lives in the first house, the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the guitarist lives to the left of the violinist. Since the violinist cannot live in the fourth house (clue 4), the guitarist and violinist must live in the first and second houses, in that order.

From clue 1, we know the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person who had stew lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house. This means the percussionist lives in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist. Since the percussionist lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the fourth house.

But wait, we already know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house! This means the history book buff cannot live in the fourth house. This means the history book buff must live in the third house, and the percussionist lives in the second house.

The final order is:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (fried rice)
- House 2: Percussionist (stew)
- House 3: History book buff (guitar)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (pizza)

The percussionist lives in the second house. The correct answer is (A)."

Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house. But we already know the person who wears boots lives in the first house.

- The dog owner lives in the third house.

The person who likes milk lives to the right of the person who drinks coffee. But the person who drinks coffee can't live in the second house. So, the person who drinks coffee must live in the first house.

If the person who drinks coffee lives in the first house, then the person who likes milk must live in the second house.

"Let's figure out where the person with sandals lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a different person. We also know that each person has a different instrument, flowers, and shoes.

From clue 1, the swimmer lives in the third house.

From clue 11, the person with daffodils lives in the fifth house.

From clue 4, the person with running shoes lives directly left of the person with daffodils. Since the person with daffodils lives in the fifth house, the person with running shoes must live in the fourth house.

"Let's figure out where the person who had stew lives.

We know two things:

1. The person who wears high heels lives next to the person who likes fish.
2. The person who had grilled cheese lives in the second house.

Since the person who had grilled cheese lives in the second house, that means the first house must be the first house. 

Now, let's think about the person who wears high heels. They live next to the person who likes fish. If the person who likes fish lives in the second house, then the person who wears high heels must live in the first house.

So, the person who wears high heels lives in the first house, and the person who likes fish lives in the second house.

Now, let's think about the person who had stew. We know the person who wears high heels lives in the first house, and the person who likes fish lives in the second house. The person who had grilled cheese lives in the second house, but we don't know if they like fish or not.

"Let's figure out where the person who is eating apples lives.

We know there are 4 houses, and each person has a favorite color, food, fruit, and drink. We also have some clues to help us solve the puzzle.

From clue 8, we know the person who had stew does not live in the third house. This means the person who had stew lives in either the first or the fourth house.

From clue 9, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means if the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. If the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water lives in the third house.

From clue 10, we know the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means if the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white lives in the second or the third house. If the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, the person who likes white lives in the third or the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the person who is eating oranges lives in the second or the third house, and the person who is eating apples lives in the third or the fourth house.

From clue 1, we know the root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. This means they live in the same house or in adjacent houses.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker. This means the person who had pizza lives in the first or the second house, and the tea drinker lives in the second or the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who had pizza lives in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house.

From clue 11, we know the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza. This means the person who is eating apples lives in the third or the fourth house.

Now, let's try to put all the clues together. If the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. The person who likes white lives in the second or the third house. The person who is eating oranges lives in the second or the third house, and the person who is eating apples lives in the third or the fourth house.

However, this would mean the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, which contradicts clue 6, as the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

So, the person who had stew lives in the fourth house. The person who only drinks water lives in the third house. The person who likes white lives in the second house. The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house, and the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (C)."
"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know there are 4 houses, and each person has different shoes, food, favorite books, and cars. We also have some clues to help us solve the puzzle.

Clue 1: The person who had stew lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.

Clue 2: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.

Clue 3: The person who wears running shoes lives directly left of the person who wears high heels.

Clue 4: The person who wears sandals lives to the right of the person who wears boots.

Clue 5: The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the history book buff.

Clue 6: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.

Clue 7: The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.

Clue 8: The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

Clue 9: The person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the person who wears boots.

Let's start with Clue 7. The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.

Now, let's look at Clue 9. The person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the person who wears boots. This means the person who wears boots cannot be in the first house.

From Clue 6, the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the person who drives a convertible is in the first house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the second house.

From Clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in the second house.

From Clue 6, the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, and the history book buff is to the right of the person who owns an SUV. So, the history book buff must be in the third house.

From Clue 8, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, but this contradicts Clue 7. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house, and the person who ate fried rice is in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who had stew lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the first house, the person who had stew must be in the first house, but this contradicts the previous conclusion that the person who ate fried rice is in the first house. Therefore, the person who had stew must be in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast is in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who wears running shoes lives directly left of the person who wears high heels. Since the person who had stew is in the second house, the person who wears running shoes must be in the second house, and the person who wears high heels is in the third house.

From Clue 4, the person who wears sandals lives to the right of the person who wears boots. Since the person who wears high heels is in the third house, the person who wears boots must be in the fourth house, and the person who wears sandals is in the fourth house.

From Clue 2, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, the person who drives a truck must be in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at the order of the houses:
1. The person who ate fried rice
2. The person who had stew
3. The fantasy book enthusiast
4. The mystery book reader

The person who had pizza is not mentioned in any of the clues, but since the person who had stew is in the second house, the person who had pizza must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have 5 houses with people in them. Each person likes a different kind of book and plays a different musical instrument. We need to find out where the violinist lives.

From clue 7, we know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. Clue 6 says the saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other. This means the violinist must live in either the third or the fifth house.

Clue 5 says the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. But clue 7 already says the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. This means the saxophonist and the mystery book reader can't be the same person. So, the saxophonist can't be in the fourth house. This means the violinist must live in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Let's figure out where the person with a gameboy lives.

We know the person with a television lives in the fourth house. 

The person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The person with a phone doesn't live in the second house.

The person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers. Since the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

There are two houses between the person with a radio and the person wearing sandals. This means the person with a radio can't live in the first or second house, because there wouldn't be two houses between them and the person wearing sandals. So, the person with a radio must live in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Person wearing boots
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person with a radio
- House 4: Person with a television

The only device left is the gameboy. The person with a radio lives in the third house, the person with a television lives in the fourth house, and the person wearing boots lives in the first house. This means the person wearing sandals must live in the second house, but we already know the person in the second house is wearing loafers. This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that the person wearing sandals is in the second house is incorrect.

The person wearing sandals must be in the first or fourth house. The person in the first house is wearing boots, so the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house. However, the person in the fourth house has a television. This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that the person wearing sandals is in the fourth house is incorrect.

The person wearing sandals must be in the first or fourth house. The person in the first house is wearing boots, so the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house.

"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

We know there are three houses, and each person has a favorite drink and wears different shoes. The clues are:

1. The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker doesn't live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk doesn't live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker doesn't live in the first house.
5. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the coffee drinker doesn't live in the second house, but we don't know where the coffee drinker lives yet.

From clue 4, we know the coffee drinker doesn't live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes milk doesn't live in the first house.

So, the person who likes milk must live in either the second or the third house. But we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, so the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person in the first house doesn't like milk and isn't wearing high heels or running shoes.
- The person in the second house wears high heels.
- The person in the third house likes milk and wears running shoes.

We still don't know who the coffee drinker is, but we know they don't live in the first or second house. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in the first house.

So, the correct order is:
- House 1: person who is a coffee drinker
- House 2: person wearing high heels
- House 3: person who likes milk and wears running shoes.

The person wearing high heels lives in the second house, so the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

We know two things:
1. The person who wears loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes mystery books does not live in the second house.

This means the person who likes mystery books lives in the first house. And the person who wears high heels lives in the first house too.

The person who wears loafers must live in the second house."
"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has different things: flowers, a device, shoes, and they ate different food.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 5, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.

Let's think about the houses. If the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, then the person who is wearing sandals lives in the fifth house (but there are only four houses!). So, the person who had pizza can't live in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew.

From clue 8, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.

The person who is wearing running shoes can't live in the third house (clue 3).

So, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in either the first or the second house.

If the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, then the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house. But this doesn't work because the person who is wearing running shoes can't live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house. The person who has a gameboy lives in the first house, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

Now, let's think about the person who had pizza again. From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 5, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.

The person who had pizza can't live in the first house because the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

The person who had pizza can't live in the second house because the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

The person who had pizza can't live in the third house because the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other, and the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

So, the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A)."
"Let's figure out where the person eating apples lives.

We know two houses are next to each other. One is house 1 and the other is house 2. There are two people living in these houses. Each person is eating a different kind of fruit: one is eating mangos and one is eating apples. Each person has different flowers in their foyer: one has a rose bouquet and one has a bouquet of lilies. Each person plays a different musical instrument: one is a pianist and one is a saxophonist.

We have some clues to help us solve this puzzle:

1. The person who has a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating mangos lives in the first house. This means the person eating apples must live in the second house because there are only two houses.

From clue 1, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies. Since the person eating mangos lives in the first house, the person with the rose bouquet must live in the first house too. This is because the person with the lilies cannot live in the first house (because the person eating mangos lives there), and the person with the rose bouquet must live to the left of the person with the lilies.

Now we have the following information:
- The person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house.
- The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
- The person eating apples lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the saxophonist does not live in the first house. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, the saxophonist must live in the second house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house.
- The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
- The person eating apples lives in the second house.
- The saxophonist lives in the second house.

So, the person eating apples lives in the second house. The correct answer is:
(B) 2"

"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

We know there are three houses, and each person has different flowers and cars. We also know some clues:

1. The person with tulips doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies.
3. The person with a sedan and the person with a rose live next to each other.
4. The person with a rose doesn't live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person with a rose can't live in the second house. This means they must live in either the first or third house.

From clue 3, we know the person with a rose lives next to the person with a sedan. Since the person with a rose can't live in the second house, the person with a rose must live in the first house, and the person with a sedan must live in the second house.

Now, let's look at clue 2: The person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies. This means the person with lilies must live in the third house, and the person with an SUV must live in either the first or second house. But we already said the person with a sedan lives in the second house, so the person with an SUV must live in the first house.

Now we have this:
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Sedan
- House 3: Lilies

We still need to figure out who has tulips. Clue 1 says the person with tulips doesn't live in the third house, which is correct since the person with lilies lives in the third house. This means the person with tulips must live in either the first or second house. But we already said the person with an SUV lives in the first house, so the person with tulips must live in the second house.

Now we have this:
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Lilies

The person who drives a truck is the only one left, and they must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve the puzzle together.

We can start by placing the history book buff, percussionist, and cellist. Since the history book buff lives to the left of the percussionist, and the cellist lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils, we can start with the history book buff in the first house.

Now, let's think about the person with a carnations arrangement. They live directly left of the pianist (clue 6). Since the pianist and the mystery book reader live next to each other, the person with a carnations arrangement must live in the second house.

The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house (clue 10). The violinist does not live in the fourth house (clue 3). The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other (clue 4).

Let's try to place the violinist. The violinist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (clue 1). The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house (clue 11). The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (clue 8).

We can start by placing the science fiction book fanatic in the third house. Then, the violinist can live in the fourth house, but we already know the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. So, the violinist must live in the third house is not possible.

Let's try to place the violinist in the second house. The science fiction book fanatic lives to the right of the violinist (clue 1). The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house (clue 2). The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other (clue 4).

We can start by placing the person with a rose bouquet in the second house. Then, the person who likes milk must live in the first house.

"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different person. We also know some clues about the people in the houses.

Clue 1 says the person with tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. Clue 7 says the person with carnations lives in the first house. So, the person with tulips and the bird keeper must live in the second and third houses.

Clue 6 says the person with horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. But we don't know who lives in the first house yet. Let's think about it. If the person with horses lives in the first house, then the person who likes blue must live in the second house. But Clue 3 says the person with a sedan lives next to the fish enthusiast. If the person with horses lives in the first house, then the person with a sedan can't live in the first house because the first house is already taken by the person with carnations.

So, the person with horses must live in the second house, and the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

- One person plays the piano.
- One person plays the cello.
- One person likes the color red.
- One person likes the color green.
- One person likes mystery books.

Here are the clues:

1. The person who likes fantasy books lives in the first house.
2. The person who plays the cello lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1 and 2, we know that the person in the first house likes fantasy books and plays the cello.

From clue 3, we know that the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. This means the person who likes green lives in the first house, and the person who likes red lives in the second house.

The mystery book reader lives in the second house, which is house number 2.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know there are three houses, and three people live in them. Each person likes a different kind of book, and each person plays a different sport. The sports are cricket, golf, and swimming. The books are science fiction, history, and fantasy.

We also know a few things:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. There is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic.

Let's think about this. If the golfer lives in the second house, and there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic, that means the swimmer can't live in the first house (because there would be no house between them and the science fiction book fanatic). And the swimmer can't live in the second house (because the golfer lives there). So, the swimmer must live in the third house.

So, the answer is: (B) 2"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 8, we know the bird keeper lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who eats a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. Since the soccer player is in the fourth house, the person who eats a banana must be in the third house. But this contradicts clue 8, so the person who eats a banana must be in the second house, and the soccer player must be in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the person who eats apples. Since the soccer player is in the fourth house, the swimmer must be in the second house, and the person who eats apples must be in the first house.

"Let's figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

We know that there are two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. Each person in the houses has different things: one ate fried rice and one ate spaghetti, one has a cat and one has horses, one likes history books and one likes romance books, and one wears sandals and one wears running shoes.

We have two clues:

1. The person who wears sandals lives next to the person who has horses.
2. The person who likes history books lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.

From the first clue, we know that the person who wears sandals lives next to the person who has horses. Since they live next to each other, the person who has horses must live in the house on the right (house 2). The person who wears sandals must live in the house on the left (house 1).

From the second clue, we know that the person who likes history books lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has horses lives in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2. But wait, we already said the person who has horses lives in house 2! This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2, and the person who likes history books must live in house 1.

Now, let's think about the person who ate fried rice. We know that the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in house 1.

"Let's figure out where the person with the lilies lives.

We know two things:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house.

We have two houses, house 1 and house 2. The person with the sedan lives in one of them, and the person with the lilies lives in the other.

Since the flutist does not live in house 1, the flutist must live in house 2. This means the person with the saxophone lives in house 2.

Now, let's think about the person with the sedan. They live to the left of the person with the lilies. If the person with the sedan lived in house 2, the person with the lilies would live to the right of the person with the sedan, which is not true.

So, the person with the sedan must live in house 1. This means the person with the lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (B)."

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have 5 houses with 5 people, each eating a different food and liking a different color. We need to find out where the person who likes white lives.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's try to place the person who likes white in the first house. If the person who likes white lives in the first house, then the person who likes red must live in the second house (from clue 6), the person who had stew must live in the third house (as the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house (as the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white), and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house (as the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person who likes green lives in the fifth house (as the person who likes green does not live in the second house), which is correct.

However, we can't be sure yet. Let's try to place the person who likes white in the second house. If the person who likes white lives in the second house, then the person who likes red must live in the first house (from clue 6), the person who had stew must live in the third house (as the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house (as the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white), and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house (as the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person who likes green lives in the fifth house (as the person who likes green does not live in the second house), which is correct.

However, we can't be sure yet. Let's try to place the person who likes white in the third house. If the person who likes white lives in the third house, then the person who likes red must live in the second house (from clue 6), the person who had stew must live in the fourth house (as the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fifth house (as the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white), and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house (as the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person who likes green lives in the first house (as the person who likes green does not live in the second house), which contradicts the fact that the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

Now, let's try to place the person who likes white in the fourth house. If the person who likes white lives in the fourth house, then the person who likes red must live in the third house (from clue 6), the person who had stew must live in the fifth house (as the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house (as the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white), and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house (as the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person who likes green lives in the second house (as the person who likes green does not live in the second house), which contradicts the fact that the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

Now, let's try to place the person who likes white in the fifth house. If the person who likes white lives in the fifth house, then the person who likes red must live in the fourth house (from clue 6), the person who had stew must live in the third house (as the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house (as the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white), and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house (as the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person who likes green lives in the first house (as the person who likes green does not live in the second house), which contradicts the fact that the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

Now, let's try to place the person who likes white in the first house.

However, this would mean the person who likes green lives in the fifth house (as the person who likes green does not live in the second house), which is correct.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out where the basketball player lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a person in it. Each person likes a different color (red, yellow, or green), plays a different instrument (piano, violin, or percussion), and plays a different sport (baseball, tennis, or basketball).

From clue 5, we know the person who plays the percussion instrument lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or third house. But since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

Now, let's think about the sports. We know the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player (clue 3). And the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player (clue 1).

So, if the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player, and the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player, then the basketball player must live in the second house. The tennis player must live in the first house, and the violinist must live in the third house.

So, the basketball player lives in the second house, which is option (C)."

"Let's figure out where the person with a vase of tulips lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a different device, car, flowers, and pet. We also have some clues to help us solve the puzzle.

From clue 11, we know that the person with a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live next to each other.

From clue 12, we know that there are two houses between the person who drives a truck and the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 8, we know that the person who drives a truck lives next to the person who has a computer.

From clue 14, we know that the person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 16, we know that the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, we know that the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live next to each other.

Let's think about the houses. If the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house, then the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house. But then, the person who drives a truck would live in the third house, and the person who has a computer would live in the fourth house. This would mean the person who has a carnations arrangement would live in the fifth house, which is not allowed.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips cannot live in the first house. Let's try the second house. If the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house, then the person who drives a convertible must live in the third house. But then, the person who drives a truck would live in the fourth house, and the person who has a computer would live in the fifth house. This would mean the person who has a carnations arrangement would live in the first house, which is not allowed.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips cannot live in the second house. Let's try the third house.

But then, the person who drives a truck would live in the fifth house, and the person who has a computer would live in the second house.

"Let's figure out where the dog owner lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different person. We also know some clues about the people in the houses.

Clue 1: There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
Clue 2: The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
Clue 4: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
Clue 5: The basketball player lives in the first house.
Clue 6: The saxophonist lives in the first house.
Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Let's start with Clue 5 and Clue 6. We know the basketball player lives in the first house, and the saxophonist lives in the first house. This means the basketball player and the saxophonist are the same person.

Now, let's look at Clue 7. We know the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the saxophonist (or basketball player) is in the first house, the person who had stew must be in the second house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, we know the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the tea drinker must be in the second house.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: basketball player/saxophonist
- House 2: person who had stew, tea drinker
- House 3: cricketer, person who likes milk

From Clue 4, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who had stew is in the second house, the person who had pizza must be in the first house.

From Clue 1, we know there is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the person who had pizza is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the third house, and the cat lover must be in the second house.

But wait, we already know the person who had stew is in the second house, and the tea drinker is in the second house. This means the cat lover and the person who had stew/tea drinker are the same person. This is not possible, so we need to rethink our answer.

Let's go back to Clue 3. We know there is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives. Since the person who had stew is in the second house, the person who only drinks water must be in the first house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: person who only drinks water
- House 2: person who had stew, tea drinker
- House 3: cricketer, fish enthusiast

From Clue 4, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who had stew is in the second house, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the dog owner must be in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person with a bouquet of lilies lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses have different things: one person likes cats, one person likes fish, one person has a computer, one person has a radio, one person likes romance books, one person likes history books, one person has lilies, one person has daffodils, and one person wears high heels and the other person wears loafers.

We know the person who likes history books lives in the first house. We also know the person who likes cats does not live in the second house.

The person who wears high heels lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. This means the person who wears high heels lives in the first house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

The person who wears loafers lives to the right of the person who has a computer. Since the person who likes history books lives in the first house, the person who has a computer must live in the second house. This means the person who wears loafers also lives in the second house.

"Let's figure out where the pianist lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a person who plays a different instrument and eats a different fruit. The instruments are violin, flute, and piano, and the fruits are kiwis, grapes, and oranges.

Clue 1: The pianist and the person who eats kiwis live next to each other.

Clue 2: The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.

Clue 3: There is one house between the person who eats grapes and the person who eats kiwis.

Clue 4: There is one house between the violinist and the person who eats kiwis.

Let's think about it. If the violinist is in house 1, the person who eats grapes would be in house 2, and the person who eats kiwis would be in house 3. But then the pianist and the person who eats kiwis wouldn't be next to each other.

If the violinist is in house 2, the person who eats grapes would be in house 1, and the person who eats kiwis would be in house 3. But then the pianist and the person who eats kiwis wouldn't be next to each other again.

If the violinist is in house 3, the person who eats grapes would be in house 1, and the person who eats kiwis would be in house 2. This works! The pianist and the person who eats kiwis are next to each other.

Now, let's think about the flutist. Clue 2 says the flutist lives to the right of the violinist. If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist would be in house 3 too, but that's not possible because the pianist and the person who eats kiwis need to be next to each other.

So, the violinist must be in house 2, the person who eats grapes is in house 1, and the person who eats kiwis is in house 3. The pianist must be in house 3, because the pianist and the person who eats kiwis live next to each other.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure this out. We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in each house. They like different things. One person likes kiwis and one person likes oranges. They also like different kinds of books. One person likes history books and one person likes fantasy books.

We know two things:

1. The person who likes kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The person who likes fantasy books does not live in the first house.

So, the person who likes kiwis lives in house 1. And the person who likes oranges lives in house 2. 

Since the person who likes fantasy books does not live in the first house, they must live in house 2. The person in house 2 likes oranges, and the person in house 1 likes kiwis. We don't know who likes fantasy books yet, but we know it's not the person in house 1.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes red lives.

We know there are 4 houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has a different thing: a gameboy, a computer, a television, or a radio. They also like different colors: red, white, yellow, or green. They ate different foods: pizza, fried rice, grilled cheese, or spaghetti. And they have different pets: a cat, a dog, horses, or a bird.

Here are the clues:

1. The person who likes birds and the person who has a television live next to each other.
2. The person who likes green doesn't live in the second house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who has a dog.
4. The person who likes cats lives to the right of the person who likes birds.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. The person who had pizza doesn't live in the third house.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. The person who has a television lives to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. The person who has a computer doesn't live in the second house.
12. There's one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who has a television.

Let's start with clue 5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From clue 10, we know the person who has a television lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who has a television lives in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes birds and the person who has a television live next to each other. But we already know the person who has a television lives in the second house. So, the person who likes birds lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes green doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who likes green lives in the first, third, or fourth house.

From clue 8, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. Since the person who likes green can't live in the second house, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in the first or fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who has a dog. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house. But that's not right, because the person who had pizza can't live in the third house (clue 6). So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house, and the person who had pizza must live in the third house.

From clue 9, we know the person who has a radio lives in the third house. Since the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the person who likes red must live in the third house, which is correct.

The person who has a computer can't live in the second house (clue 11), so they must live in the first, third, or fourth house. But the person who likes red lives in the third house, so the person who has a computer must live in the first or fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes cats lives to the right of the person who likes birds. Since the person who likes birds lives in the second house, the person who likes cats must live in the third or fourth house. But the person who likes red lives in the third house, so the person who likes cats must live in the fourth house.

From clue 12, we know there's one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who has a television. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the third house, this condition is satisfied.

So, the houses are arranged like this:

- House 1: Person who likes green, has a computer
- House 2: Person who likes birds, ate fried rice
- House 3: Person who likes red, has a radio, had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes cats, has a gameboy, ate grilled cheese

The person who likes red lives in the third house, so the correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's figure out where the root beer lover lives.

We know two things:

1. The person who loves root beer does not live in the second house.
2. The person who plays the piano lives next to the person who plays the cello.

Since the person who plays the piano lives next to the person who plays the cello, and they are next to each other, one must live in house 1 and the other in house 2. The person who plays the piano lives in house 1 because they are to the left of the person who plays the cello.

Now, we know the person who loves root beer does not live in house 2. So, the person who loves root beer must live in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person with lilies lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each person has different shoes and flowers. We also know some clues about who lives next to who and where.

From clue 7, we know the person with carnations lives in the fifth house.

From clue 1, the person with boots and the person with carnations live next to each other. So, the person with boots must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the person with tulips lives to the left of the person with loafers. But we also know the person with boots lives in the fourth house, so the person with tulips can't live in the fourth house. That means the person with tulips must live in the first or second house.

From clue 8, the person with daffodils and the person with running shoes live next to each other. Since the person with boots lives in the fourth house, the person with daffodils and the person with running shoes must live in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 5, the person with tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the person with tulips can't live in the fourth house, the person with tulips must live in the second house, and the person with daffodils must live in the first house.

From clue 8, the person with running shoes must live in the third house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies. Since the person with running shoes lives in the third house, the person with lilies must live in the fifth house. But we already know the person with carnations lives in the fifth house, so that can't be right.

Let's try again. From clue 5, the person with tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the person with tulips can't live in the fourth house, the person with tulips must live in the third house, and the person with daffodils must live in the second house.

From clue 8, the person with running shoes must live in the first house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies. Since the person with running shoes lives in the first house, the person with lilies must live in the third house.

From clue 2, the person with tulips lives to the left of the person with loafers. Since the person with tulips lives in the third house, the person with loafers must live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person with carnations lives in the fifth house.

So, the order of the houses is: 1 (running shoes), 2 (daffodils), 3 (tulips), 4 (loafers), 5 (carnations).

The person with lilies must live in the house that is not yet assigned, which is the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's solve the puzzle together.

We have 4 houses with different people living in them. Each person plays a different instrument, likes a different color, plays a different sport, eats a different fruit, and drinks a different beverage.

From clue 10, we know that the swimmer and the person who likes white live next to each other. This means they can be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

From clue 4, the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer must be in house 1.

From clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white. This means the person who likes white must be in house 2.

So, the order of the first two houses is: swimmer, white.

From clue 2, the baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player must live in either house 1 or house 4.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the person who is eating grapes must live in either house 1 or house 3.

From clue 7, the saxophonist lives to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist must live in either house 1 or house 2.

From clue 12, the person who likes blue lives to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue must live in either house 1 or house 2.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or house 4.

From clue 1, there are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the person who is eating apples must live in either house 3 or house 4.

"Let's figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

We know there are three houses, and each person has something different for lunch, a favorite color, and different shoes. We also have some clues to help us solve the puzzle.

Clue 1 says the person wearing high heels doesn't live in the third house. Clue 2 says the person who likes white lives in the first house. Clue 3 says the person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the second house. Clue 4 says the person who likes green lives in the second house. Clue 5 says the person wearing boots lives directly left of the person wearing high heels. Clue 6 says the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person who had stew. Clue 7 says the person who had stew doesn't live in the second house.

Let's start with Clue 2. We know the person who likes white lives in the first house. That's a good start!

Now, let's think about Clue 4. We know the person who likes green lives in the second house. That means the first house and the second house are already taken.

Clue 7 says the person who had stew doesn't live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or the third house. But we already know the first house is taken by the person who likes white. So, the person who had stew must live in the third house.

Clue 6 says the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

Clue 5 says the person wearing boots lives directly left of the person wearing high heels. That means the person wearing high heels must live in the second house.

Now we have the first house, second house, and third house filled in. The first house is taken by the person who likes white and wears boots. The second house is taken by the person who likes green and wears high heels. The third house is taken by the person who had stew.

The only option left is the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the second house (Clue 3), and the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house is taken by the person who likes green and wears high heels, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house is taken by the person who likes white and wears boots, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."

"Let's figure out where the romance book lover lives.

We know two things:
1. The person who drinks coffee lives to the left of the person who wears sandals.
2. The person who likes science fiction books lives in the first house.

Since the person who likes science fiction books lives in the first house, the person who drinks coffee must also live in the first house. This is because the person who wears sandals can't live in the first house, because the science fiction book lover is already there.

Now we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker and science fiction book lover
- House 2: Unknown

The only thing we don't know about house 1 is what kind of shoes the person is wearing. We also know that the person in house 2 must drink water.

The only thing left to figure out is what kind of shoes the person in house 2 is wearing. Since the person in house 1 drinks coffee, the person in house 2 must wear sandals.

- House 1: Coffee drinker and science fiction book lover (wearing loafers)

"Let's figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person ate something different for lunch: fried rice, spaghetti, or grilled cheese. They also like different kinds of books: science fiction, fantasy, or mystery.

Here are the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. Clue 4 says the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house too. This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast are in the same house.

Now, let's think about clue 2. It says the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

We have the following so far:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Fried rice and fantasy book enthusiast

From clue 1, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. But we already know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house, so the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the first house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Fried rice and fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Spaghetti

The only person left is the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person with the carnations lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The houses are numbered 1 and 2. We also know that one person has a vase of tulips and the other has a carnations arrangement. And one person has a dog, and the other has horses.

The clue says that the person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2 from left to right, the person with the carnations must live in the house on the left, which is house 1.

So, the person with the carnations lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person wearing high heels lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The person in the left house is wearing sandals, and the person in the right house is eating kiwis. 

From clue 2, we know the person wearing sandals lives left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person wearing sandals lives in the left house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the right house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis lives in the right house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the right house, the person eating kiwis must be the person who likes yellow.

Now, let's look at clue 1. It says the person who only drinks water lives left of the person wearing high heels. This means the person wearing high heels lives in the right house.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in the right house, which is house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

We know that there are two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses have different things: one has a TV and one has a phone, one is wearing sandals and one is wearing high heels, one likes tea and one likes water, and one is eating kiwis and one is eating grapes.

From the clues, we know that the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. We also know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other. Since the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, the person eating grapes must live in the left house and the person wearing sandals must live in the right house.

The next clue tells us that the person who likes tea lives to the left of the person with a TV. Since the person eating grapes lives in the left house, the person with a TV must live in the right house.

So, the houses look like this:
- House 1: person eating grapes, person wearing high heels
- House 2: person with a TV, person eating kiwis

The person eating kiwis lives in the right house, which is house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the guitarist lives.

We know there are three houses, and three people live in them. Each person likes a different drink: milk, tea, or water. And each person plays a different instrument: violin, cello, or guitar.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes tea lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who plays the violin doesn't live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know there's one house between the violinist and the guitarist.

Let's think about it. If the violinist lives in the first house, then the guitarist would live in the third house. But clue 4 says the violinist doesn't live in the third house. So, the violinist must live in the second house.

Now, from clue 1, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist. Since the tea drinker lives in the first house, the cellist must live in the second house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the third house.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: Tea drinker (plays an unknown instrument)
- House 2: Cellist (plays an unknown instrument)
- House 3: Water drinker (plays an unknown instrument)

Since the violinist lives in the second house, the cellist must be in the second house, and the guitarist must be in the third house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each person has different shoes and drinks different things. We also know some clues about the people and their houses.

Clue 2: The person who wears running shoes doesn't live in the first house.

Clue 3: The person who wears sandals lives next to the person who only drinks water.

Clue 6: The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person who wears boots.

Clue 7: The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 3, we know the person who wears sandals lives next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who wears sandals lives in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Let's figure out where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each person has a different device and ate something different for lunch. We also have some clues to help us solve the problem.

Clue 1: The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live next to each other.

Clue 2: The person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a phone.

Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.

Clue 4: There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.

Clue 5: The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Clue 6: The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.

Clue 7: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

Clue 8: The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by using Clue 7. We know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. This means the person who has a computer cannot live in the fourth house, because Clue 8 says so.

Now, let's think about Clue 1. The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live next to each other. This means they can live in either the first and second house, or the second and third house, or the third and fourth house, or the fourth and fifth house. But we already know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, so the person who has a computer and the person who has a gameboy cannot live in the fourth house. This means they must live in either the first and second house, or the second and third house, or the third and fifth house.

Now, let's think about Clue 3. There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives. This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in either the first or second house, and the person who has a radio lives in either the third or fifth house.

Now, let's think about Clue 5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either the second or third house.

Now, let's think about Clue 2. The person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a phone. This means the person who has a television lives in either the first or second house, and the person who has a phone lives in either the third or fifth house.

Now, let's think about Clue 4. There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives. This means the person who has a gameboy lives in either the first or second house, and the person who ate fried rice lives in either the third or fourth house.

Now, let's put all the clues together. We know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. We know the person who has a computer and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. We know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in either the first or second house. We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in either the second or third house. We know the person who has a television lives in either the first or second house. We know the person who has a phone lives in either the third or fifth house. We know the person who ate fried rice lives in either the third or fourth house.

From all these clues, we can see that the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

The correct answer is (E) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person who is eating a banana lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a person with different characteristics. We need to find out where the person who eats a banana lives.

From clue 16, the tennis player lives in the first house.

From clue 12, the tennis player and the baseball player live next to each other. Since the tennis player is in the first house, the baseball player must be in the second house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the second house. But wait, we already know the baseball player lives in the second house. This means the bird keeper must live in a different house.

From clue 6, the dog owner does not live in the first house. This means the dog owner lives in the third, fourth, or fifth house.

From clue 11, the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since the tennis player lives in the first house, the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first and second houses.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other. Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana must live in the second and fourth houses.

From clue 18, the pianist does not live in the third house. This means the pianist lives in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.

From clue 1, the pianist lives left of the person who owns horses. Since the pianist lives in the fourth house, the person who owns horses must live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the person who is eating mangos lives right of the person who owns horses. Since the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the fifth house.

From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the fourth house.

From clue 19, the person who is eating oranges lives right of the golfer. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house, the golfer must live in the third house.

From clue 14, there is one house between the saxophonist and the golfer. Since the saxophonist lives in the first house and the golfer lives in the third house, this is true.

From clue 7, the cellist does not live in the fifth house. This means the cellist lives in the first, second, third, or fourth house. But we already know the first house is occupied by the saxophonist, the second house is occupied by the saxophonist, and the third house is occupied by the golfer. This means the cellist must live in the fourth house.

From clue 13, the basketball player lives left of the cat lover. Since the cellist lives in the first house, the basketball player must live in the second house, and the cat lover must live in the third house.

From clue 20, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house. This means the person who had pizza lives in the first, second, third, or fourth house. But we already know the first house is occupied by the saxophonist, the second house is occupied by the saxophonist, the third house is occupied by the golfer, and the fourth house is occupied by the pianist. This means the person who had pizza must live in the fifth house.

From clue 9, the person who owns horses lives right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, the person who owns horses must live in the fifth house.

From clue 17, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. But we already know the pianist lives in the fourth house. This means the percussionist must live in a different house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other. Since the person who had stew lives in the second house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know two things:
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper.
- The percussionist does not live in the second house.

Since the bird keeper lives in one of the houses, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper, the bird keeper can't live in the second house. That means the bird keeper lives in the first house.

Now, we know the percussionist doesn't live in the second house. So, the percussionist must live in the first house. But we already know the bird keeper lives in the first house. This means the percussionist can't live in the first house.

So, the percussionist must live in the second house. And the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house too.

But we know the percussionist lives in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house. This means the percussionist is the person who ate grilled cheese.

Now, we have the bird keeper in the first house, and the percussionist (who ate grilled cheese) in the second house. The only person left is the guitarist, who must live in the first house. And since the person in the first house ate pizza, the answer is:

The person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has a different pet, car, and plays a different sport.

From clue 2, we know the bird keeper lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives to the left of the bird keeper. This means the soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 9, we know the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the soccer player. This means the fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

Now, let's think about the other clues:

- Clue 1 says the cat lover doesn't live in the second house. This means the cat lover lives in the first, third, or fourth house.
- Clue 3 says the golfer lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. This means the golfer lives in the first or second house.
- Clue 4 says the person who drives a convertible doesn't live in the first house. This means the person who drives a convertible lives in the second, third, or fourth house.
- Clue 5 says the baseball player doesn't live in the third house. This means the baseball player lives in the first or second house.
- Clue 6 says the person who drives a convertible doesn't live in the third house. This means the person who drives a convertible lives in the second or fourth house.
- Clue 7 says the person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the baseball player. This means the baseball player lives in the first house.

So, the order of houses from left to right is: fish enthusiast, baseball player, ?, ?.

We already know the bird keeper lives in the third house. The person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the baseball player, so the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house.

The person who drives a truck lives in the fourth house (clue 10 is not given, but we can infer it from the other clues).

The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house (clue 4 and clue 6).

The cat lover lives in the fourth house (clue 1).

The correct order of houses from left to right is: fish enthusiast, baseball player, bird keeper, cat lover.

The bird keeper lives in the third house.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have three houses with people who have different pets, play different musical instruments, eat different fruits, wear different shoes, and like different books.

From clue 10, we know the cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person eating a banana. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.

From clue 9, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the flutist must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house. But this contradicts clue 10, which says the cat lover lives in the first house. So, the flutist is not in the third house.

From clue 9, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

From clue 8, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person wearing running shoes must be in the second house.

From clue 7, the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist. Since the person eating oranges cannot be in the first house (because the cat lover is in the first house), the pianist must be in the first house, and the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

From clue 6, the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the flutist is also in the third house. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that the flutist is in the third house. So, the flutist must be in the second house, and the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

From clue 1, the person wearing loafers does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the person wearing loafers must be in the first house.

From clue 2, the percussionist does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the first house.

From clue 4, the history book buff does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the first house.

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that the fantasy book enthusiast is in the third house. So, the person wearing running shoes must be in the first house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house.

Now, let's look at the remaining options: the person eating bananas, the person wearing high heels, and the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the person eating bananas is in the second house, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

So, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. This means they can be in the first and second houses, or the second and third houses, or the third and fourth houses. But since the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house, the person who likes green and the person who likes red cannot be in the second and third houses. So, they must be in the first and second houses, or the third and fourth houses.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green cannot be in the fourth house. So, the person who likes green must be in the first or second house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the person who is eating kiwis cannot be in the second house, because the person who likes red would be in the third or fourth house, and the person who likes green would be in the first house, which is not possible because the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.

So, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the first house. The person who likes green must be in the second house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white must be in the first or third house, and the person who is eating a banana must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white must be in the first house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.

So, the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who likes green is in the second house, the person who likes red is in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana is in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person who had stew lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. Each person in the houses has different things: they ate different food, have different pets, eat different fruits, like different books, and wear different shoes.

Here are the clues:

1. The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
2. The person who likes mystery books lives next to the person who likes cats.
3. The person who likes mystery books and the person who had stew live next to each other.

Let's think about it. If the person who likes mystery books lives next to the person who likes cats, and they live next to the person who had stew, then the person who had stew must be the cat lover.

Now, let's think about the person eating oranges. The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges can't be wearing running shoes.

So, the person eating oranges must be wearing sandals. And the person wearing running shoes must be to the right of the person eating oranges.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person eating oranges is wearing sandals.
- The person who had stew (cat lover) lives next to the person who likes mystery books.
- The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.

The only way this can work is if the person eating oranges lives in the left house, and the person wearing running shoes lives in the right house.

So, the person who had stew lives in the right house, which is house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes milk lives.

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person has different flowers, drinks, and devices. We have some clues to help us solve the puzzle.

Clue 1: The person with daffodils lives left of the person with a phone.

Clue 2: The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.

Clue 3: The person who likes root beer lives in the first house.

Clue 4: The person with a TV does not live in the second house.

Clue 5: The person with a TV lives to the right of the person with tulips.

Let's start by using Clue 3. We know the person who likes root beer lives in the first house.

Now, let's think about Clue 1. If the person with daffodils lives left of the person with a phone, and the person with root beer lives in the first house, then the person with daffodils must live in the second house. But wait, Clue 2 says the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. This means the person with daffodils cannot live in the second house.

So, let's try again. If the person with daffodils lives left of the person with a phone, and the person with root beer lives in the first house, then the person with daffodils must live in the first house. But this is a problem because the person with root beer lives in the first house. This means our first guess was wrong.

"Let's figure out where the person with a computer lives.

We know there are three houses, and each person has something different: different shoes, favorite drinks, fruits, and devices.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the first house.

From Clue 7, we know the person eating kiwis doesn't live in the first house. This means the person eating kiwis lives in either the second or third house.

From Clue 5, we know the person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person who likes milk. This means the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, and the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating grapes lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person eating grapes lives in the first house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives to the left of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos can't live in the first house, the person with a phone must live in the first house.

From Clue 6, we know the person wearing boots lives to the right of the person with a gameboy. Since the person with a gameboy can't live in the first house, the person with a gameboy must live in the second house, and the person wearing boots must live in the third house.

Now, we have to figure out where the person with a computer lives. We know the person with a phone lives in the first house, the person eating grapes lives in the first house, and the person eating kiwis lives in the second house. The person with a gameboy lives in the second house, and the person wearing boots lives in the third house. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Let's solve the puzzle together.

We have three houses with different people living in them. Each person likes a different sport, has a different flower arrangement, and has a different pet. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

Here are the clues:

1. The golfer does not live in the third house.
2. The person who likes fish lives to the left of the person who likes horses.
3. The golfer and the baseball player live next to each other.
4. The person with carnations lives next to the person who likes horses.
5. The person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player.
6. The person with roses lives to the left of the person with daffodils.
7. The cricketer does not live in the third house.

Let's start by using clue 6. We know the person with roses lives to the left of the person with daffodils. This means the person with roses must be in the first house, and the person with daffodils must be in the third house.

Now, let's use clue 4. We know the person with carnations lives next to the person who likes horses. This means the person with carnations must be in the first or second house, and the person who likes horses must be in the second or third house.

But wait! We already know the person with daffodils is in the third house. So, the person who likes horses must be in the second house.

Now, let's use clue 2. We know the person who likes fish lives to the left of the person who likes horses. This means the person who likes fish must be in the first house.

Now, let's use clue 3. We know the golfer and the baseball player live next to each other. This means they must be in the second or third house.

But wait! We already know the person who likes horses is in the second house. So, the golfer and the baseball player must be in the second house.

Now, let's use clue 5. We know the person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player. This means the person with carnations must be in the first house.

So, the person with carnations is in the first house, the person who likes fish is in the first house, the person who likes horses is in the second house, and the golfer and the baseball player are in the second house.

But wait! We can't have two people in the second house. This means the golfer and the baseball player must be in the first and second houses, but the person with carnations is already in the first house. So, the baseball player must be in the first house, and the golfer must be in the second house.

Now, let's use clue 7. We know the cricketer does not live in the third house. This means the cricketer must be in the first or second house.

But wait! We already know the person with carnations is in the first house, and the baseball player is in the first house. So, the cricketer must be in the second house.

So, the person with roses is in the first house, the baseball player is in the first house, the person with carnations is in the first house, the cricketer is in the second house, the golfer is in the second house, the person who likes fish is in the first house, the person who likes horses is in the second house, and the person with daffodils is in the third house.

The person who owns horses lives in the second house.

The answer is (C)."
"Let's figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

We know that there are three houses, and each person has different pets, cars, and eats different fruits. The person eating oranges lives in the first house (Clue 1).

Since the person eating oranges lives in the first house, the person eating mangos does not live in the third house (Clue 4). This means the person eating mangos must live in the second or third house.

We also know that the person who owns horses lives in the third house (Clue 5).

The person who eats mangos and the person who drives a convertible live next to each other (Clue 6). This means the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in the second and third houses.

Since the person eating oranges lives in the first house, and the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible live next to each other, the person eating mangos must live in the second house, and the person driving a convertible must live in the third house.

Now, we know that the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible (Clue 2). This means the person driving a truck must live in the second house.

But wait, we already know the person eating mangos lives in the second house! This means the person driving a truck cannot live in the second house.

Let's think about it again. If the person eating mangos lives in the second house, and the person driving a convertible lives in the third house, the person driving a truck must live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between where the guitarist"
"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. We also know that:

- One person likes tea and one likes root beer.
- One person plays the cello and one plays the guitar.
- One person has horses and one has a cat.
- One person likes mystery books and one likes history books.

Clue 1: The cello player lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books.

Clue 2: The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who likes cats.

Clue 3: The person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live next to each other.

Let's start with Clue 3. If the person who likes root beer lives in the left house, the person who plays the guitar must live in the right house. If the person who likes root beer lives in the right house, the person who plays the guitar must live in the left house.

Now, let's think about Clue 1. The cello player lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books. This means the cello player can live in the left house, and the person who likes mystery books can live in the right house. Or, the cello player can live in the right house, and the person who likes mystery books can live in the left house.

Now, let's think about Clue 2. The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who likes cats. This means the person who likes history books can live in the left house, and the person who likes cats can live in the right house. Or, the person who likes history books can live in the right house, and the person who likes cats can live in the left house.

Let's put it all together. If the person who likes root beer lives in the left house, the person who plays the guitar must live in the right house. The cello player lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books, so the cello player must live in the left house, and the person who likes mystery books must live in the right house. The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who likes cats, so the person who likes history books must live in the left house, and the person who likes cats must live in the right house.

Now, we have a problem. The person who likes history books lives in the left house, and the cello player lives in the left house. But we said the cello player lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books. This means the cello player must live in the left house, and the person who likes mystery books must live in the right house. But we also said the person who likes history books lives in the left house. This is a problem.

Let's try again. If the person who likes root beer lives in the right house, the person who plays the guitar must live in the left house. The cello player lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books, so the cello player must live in the left house, and the person who likes mystery books must live in the right house. The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who likes cats, so the person who likes history books must live in the left house, and the person who likes cats must live in the right house.

Now, we have a problem. The person who likes history books lives in the left house, and the cello player lives in the left house. But we said the cello player lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books. This means the cello player must live in the left house, and the person who likes mystery books must live in the right house. But we also said the person who likes history books lives in the left house. This is a problem.

Let's try again. If the person who likes root beer lives in the left house, the person who plays the guitar must live in the right house. The cello player lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books, so the cello player must live in the left house, and the person who likes mystery books must live in the right house. The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who likes cats, so the person who likes history books must live in the right house, and the person who likes cats must live in the left house.

Now, we have a problem. The person who likes history books lives in the right house, and the person who likes mystery books lives in the right house. But we said the person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who likes cats. This means the person who likes history books must live in the left house, and the person who likes cats must live in the right house.

Now, let's think about who owns the horses. The person who owns the horses is not the cello player, the person who likes history books, the person who likes cats, or the person who likes mystery books. The only person left is the person who likes root beer or the person who plays the guitar. But the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live next to each other. This means they cannot live in the same house as the person who owns the horses.

The person who owns the horses must live in the left house, and the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar must live in the right house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person with tulips lives.

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person has a different pet and a different kind of flowers in their house.

Clue 1: The person with carnations lives to the right of the person with a bird.

Clue 2: The person with a dog doesn't live in the middle house.

Clue 3: The person with tulips lives to the right of the person with a dog.

Let's think about this. If the person with a dog lives in the first house, the person with tulips would live in the second house. If the person with a dog lives in the third house, the person with tulips would live in the fourth house, but there are only three houses.

So, the person with a dog must live in the first house, and the person with tulips must live in the second house.

The answer is (B)."
"Let's solve the puzzle together.

Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house, the person with a phone must live in the first house. But we already know the person wearing high heels lives in the first house. This means our assumption that the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house is incorrect.

Let's try again. From clue 4, we know the swimmer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with a vase of tulips must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with a vase of tulips. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. Each person eats a different kind of fruit: oranges, kiwis, mangos, and bananas. They also have different pets: horses, dogs, birds, and cats.

From the clues, we know:

1. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns horses doesn't live in the first house.
3. The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
4. The person eating a banana doesn't live in the third house.
5. The person who owns horses doesn't live in the second house.
6. The person eating a banana lives next to the dog owner.

Let's think about this step by step. We know the person eating mangos lives in the first house. The person eating a banana lives next to the dog owner, so the dog owner can't be in the first house because the person eating mangos is already there. This means the person eating a banana must be in the second house, and the dog owner is in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person eating a banana
- House 3: Dog owner

The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other. Since the person eating a banana is in the second house, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in the first and third houses, but we already know the first house is occupied by the person eating mangos. So, the bird keeper must be in the third house, and the person eating kiwis must be in the fourth house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person eating a banana
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Person eating kiwis

The bird keeper lives in the third house. The correct answer is (D)."
"Let's figure out where the romance book lover lives.

We know that there are three houses, and each house has a different person. The people like different kinds of books: mystery, history, and romance. They also have different pets: cats, birds, and horses.

From clue 1, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.

So, the first house has a mystery book reader. The second house has a bird keeper, and the third house has a history book buff.

Now, let's think about the pets. We know the person who owns horses does not live in the third house, and the bird keeper lives in the second house. This means the person who owns horses must live in the first house or the third house. But we already know the first house has a mystery book reader, so the person who owns horses must live in the third house.

Now we have a problem. We know the romance book lover does not live in the third house, but we also know the person who owns horses lives in the third house. This means the romance book lover must live in the first house or the second house. But we already know the first house has a mystery book reader, so the romance book lover must live in the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know there are 4 houses, and each house has a person with a favorite drink and a favorite fruit. The drinks are root beer, coffee, water, and tea. The fruits are mangos, apples, kiwis, and grapes.

Clue 1 says the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

Clue 2 says the person eating apples lives next to the person who only drinks water.

Clue 3 says the person eating mangos doesn't live in the first house.

Clue 4 says the person eating mangos doesn't live in the third house.

Clue 5 says the person eating apples lives to the left of the person who drinks tea.

Clue 6 says the person eating kiwis doesn't live in the third house.

Let's try to figure it out step by step.

The coffee drinker lives in the second house. That's Clue 1.

Now, let's think about the person eating apples. Clue 2 says they live next to the person who only drinks water. Clue 5 says they live to the left of the person who drinks tea. This means the person eating apples can't live in the last house because the person who drinks tea would be to the right of the person eating apples.

So, the person eating apples must live in the first house. The person who only drinks water must live in the third house because they live next to the person eating apples.

Now, let's think about the person eating mangos. Clue 3 says they don't live in the first house, and Clue 4 says they don't live in the third house. This means they must live in the last house.

Since the person eating mangos lives in the last house, the person eating kiwis must live in the second house is not possible because the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

"Let's figure out where the person who is eating a banana lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a person with a favorite color, a favorite sport, and a favorite fruit. We also have some clues to help us solve the puzzle.

From clue 9, we know the person who likes white lives in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red. So, the person who likes red must live in the third house.

From clue 12, we know the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. Since the person who likes red and the person who is eating a banana both live in the third house, the soccer player must be the person who likes red.

From clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 11, we know the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. Since the baseball player lives in the fifth house, the person who likes green must be the baseball player.

From clue 10, we know there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the baseball player lives in the fifth house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house, the golfer must live in the second house. However, we already know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house. Therefore, the golfer must live in the first house, and the person who is eating oranges must be the person who is eating kiwis.

From clue 6, we know the cricketer does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who likes green lives in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person with carnations lives.

We know there are three houses, and each person has different shoes, likes different books, ate different food, has different flowers, and plays different sports.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. Since the soccer player is in the second house, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the golfer lives next to the person with a rose bouquet. Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the first house, the golfer must be in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the person wearing running shoes lives next to the person who had stew. Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the first house and the golfer is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had stew lives next to the history book buff. Since the person who had stew is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

From clue 2, we know there's one house between the person with daffodils and the golfer. Since the golfer is in the third house, the person with daffodils must be in the first house.

"Let's figure out where the percussionist lives.

We know there are three houses, and each person has a different instrument, shoes, device, and car. We also have some clues to help us solve the problem.

From clue 1, we know the person with a phone lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan.

From clue 2, we know the person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the person who drives a minivan and the cellist live next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who wears high heels and the person who has a TV live next to each other.

From clue 6, we know the flutist lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan.

From clue 7, we know the person who wears boots lives to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by using clue 6. Since the flutist lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan, and the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the person who drives a truck (clue 5), we can say the order is: truck, flutist, minivan.

Now, let's use clue 2. The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. This means the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house (house 1) or the second house (house 2). But if the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house, then the person who drives a truck must live in the second house, which is not possible because the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the person who drives a truck (clue 5). So, the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house.

Now, let's use clue 1. The person who has a phone lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the person who has a phone must live in the first house (house 1).

Now, let's use clue 3. The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live next to each other. This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the third house (house 3) or the second house (house 2). But if the person who drives a minivan lives in the second house, then the person who has a gameboy must live in the third house, which is not possible because the person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other (clue 2). So, the person who drives a minivan must live in the third house.

Now, let's use clue 5. The person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the person who drives a truck. This means the person who drives a truck must live in the first house (house 1).

Now, let's use clue 7. The person who wears boots lives to the right of the percussionist. This means the percussionist must live in the first house (house 1) or the second house (house 2). But if the percussionist lives in the first house, then the person who wears boots must live in the second house, which is not possible because the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house. So, the percussionist must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who is eating apples lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a different person. We also know that each person has a different fruit, a different device, a different musical instrument, and different flowers.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

From clue 13, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a television. So, the person who has a television lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

From clue 10, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist. So, the pianist lives in the fifth house.

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house. But we also know the pianist lives in the fifth house, so the person who is eating grapes is the pianist.

From clue 11, we know the violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. From clue 12, we know the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist. So, the order of the first three houses is: violinist, person who is eating oranges, saxophonist.

"Let's figure out who likes fantasy books.

We know two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses like different things: one likes red and one likes yellow, one eats oranges and one eats grapes, one likes mystery books and one likes fantasy books, one drives a truck and one drives a convertible, and one wears boots and one wears running shoes.

We have some clues to help us:

1. The person eating grapes lives next to the person who drives a truck.
2. The person wearing boots lives next to the person who likes mystery books.
3. The person who likes yellow lives next to the person who drives a truck.

Let's think about it. If the person eating grapes lives next to the person who drives a truck, that means the person eating grapes must live in the house on the left, and the person driving a truck must live in the house on the right.

Now, let's think about the person who likes yellow. If they live next to the person who drives a truck, that means they must live in the house on the left too. But we already said the person eating grapes lives in the house on the left. So, the person eating grapes must like yellow.

Now we know the person eating grapes lives in the house on the left and likes yellow. The person eating oranges must live in the house on the right. We also know the person wearing boots lives next to the person who likes mystery books. Since the person eating grapes lives in the house on the left, the person wearing boots must live in the house on the left too, and the person who likes mystery books must live in the house on the right.

So, the person eating grapes lives in the house on the left, the person eating oranges lives in the house on the right, the person wearing boots lives in the house on the left, and the person who likes mystery books lives in the house on the right.

Now, let's think about the person who likes fantasy books. We know the person wearing boots lives in the house on the left, and the person who likes mystery books lives in the house on the right. So, the person who likes fantasy books must live in the house on the left.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

From clue 9, we know the person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 12, we know the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.

From clue 8, we know the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

From clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue.

Let's try to place the person who had stew in the first house. From clue 2, there are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who had stew lives. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the mystery book reader must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, there is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the fifth house.

From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. From clue 4, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic. From clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. From clue 7, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.

The answer is (D)."

"Let's figure out where the soccer player lives.

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person plays a different instrument and a different sport. The instruments are a cello, a violin, and a drum. The sports are soccer, basketball, and cricket.

We have some clues to help us:

1. The person who plays the cello lives to the right of the person who plays cricket.
2. The person who plays basketball lives in the second house.
3. The person who plays the violin lives in the second house.

Since the person who plays basketball and the person who plays the violin both live in the second house, we know that's where they are. The person who plays the cello can't live in the second house because the violinist is already there. So, the cello player must live in the third house.

Now, we have the third house with the cello player. The only person left is the soccer player. The soccer player must live in the first house.

The answer is (A)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have four houses with different people, each with different flowers, favorite colors, drinks, and book preferences. We need to find out where the tea drinker lives.

From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. From clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, which means the mystery book reader also drinks water.

From clue 10, the fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live next to each other. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

From clue 9, the tea drinker lives to the right of the person who likes red. This means the person who likes red cannot live in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives to the left of the coffee drinker. This means the person who likes green cannot live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the history book buff lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot live in the first house.

From clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of carnations does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who has a bouquet of carnations must live in either the first, second, or third house.

From clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of carnations lives to the right of the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker must live in either the first or second house.

From clue 6, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in either the second or third house.

From clue 5, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. This means the person who likes white must live in either the first or second house.

Now, let's try to put the people in the houses. We know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, and the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. We also know the person who has a bouquet of carnations lives to the right of the tea drinker, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.

"Let's solve the puzzle together.

We have four houses with different people living in them. Each person plays a different instrument, has a different pet, drinks a different drink, and plays a different sport.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes milk does not live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the flutist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the tennis player does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the guitarist does not live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the violinist does not live in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.

From clue 8, we know the dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.

From clue 9, we know the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

From clue 10, we know the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.

From clue 11, we know the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

Since the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, the flutist (coffee drinker) must live in the fourth house. This means the cricketer must live in the third house.

The person who likes milk does not live in the third house (clue 1), so the person who likes milk must live in either the first or second house.

The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other (clue 10). Since the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, the tennis player must live in either the first or second house.

The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other (clue 8). Since the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, the dog owner and the root beer lover must live in either the first or second house.

The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (clue 9). Since the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, the basketball player must live in either the first, second, or third house.

Now, let's try to figure out who lives in which house.

House 1: 
- The person who likes milk does not live here (clue 1).
- The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other (clue 10).
- The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other (clue 8).

Since the person who likes milk does not live in the first house, the person who likes milk must live in the second house.

House 2: 
- The person who likes milk lives here.
- The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other (clue 10).
- The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other (clue 8).

The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, the tennis player must live in either the first or second house. The person who likes milk lives in the second house, so the tennis player must live in the first house.

House 1: 
- The tennis player lives here.
- The person who only drinks water lives here.

The person who only drinks water lives in the first house, and the tennis player lives in the first house. This means the person who only drinks water lives in the first house.

House 2: 
- The person who likes milk lives here.
- The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other (clue 8).

The person who likes milk lives in the second house, and the dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other. This means the dog owner and the root beer lover must live in the second house.

House 3: 
- The cricketer lives here.
- The guitarist does not live here (clue 5).

The cricketer lives in the third house, and the guitarist does not live in the third house. This means the guitarist must live in either the first, second, or fourth house.

House 4: 
- The person who owns horses lives here.
- The flutist (coffee drinker) lives here.
- The guitarist does not live here (clue 5).

The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, and the flutist (coffee drinker) lives in the fourth house. This means the guitarist must live in either the first, second, or third house.

Now, let's try to figure out who lives in which house.

House 1: 
- The tennis player lives here.

"Let's figure out where the person wearing running shoes lives.

We know there are three houses, and each person has different shoes, cars, and pets. We also know some clues:

1. The person wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person wearing high heels lives next to the person who owns a dog.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives next to the person wearing boots.
5. The person who loves cats lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 2, we know the person wearing high heels lives next to the person who owns a dog. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner can't be in the first house. The dog owner must be in the third house because the person wearing high heels can't be in the first house either.

From clue 3, we know the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. Since the dog owner is in the third house, the dog owner must own the sedan.

From clue 4, we know the person who owns an SUV lives next to the person wearing boots. Since the person wearing boots is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the first house.

Now we have the following information:
- The cat lover is in the first house.
- The person who owns an SUV is in the first house.
- The person who owns a sedan is in the third house.
- The person wearing boots is in the second house.

The only person left is the person wearing running shoes. Since the person wearing high heels lives next to the dog owner (who is in the third house), the person wearing high heels must be in the second house. This means the person wearing running shoes must be in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."

"Let's solve the problem together.

We have three houses with people living in them. Each person likes a different kind of book: mystery, science fiction, or history. They also have different devices: a computer, a television, or a phone.

Here are the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person with a television.

From clue 1 and clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house and the history book buff lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person with a television. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with a television must be in the second house.

Now, let's think about the person with a computer. From clue 3, we know the person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a phone. Since the person with a television is in the second house, the person with a computer must be in the second house, and the person with a phone must be in the first house.

However, this doesn't make sense because the person with a computer is in the second house, and the history book buff is supposed to be in the third house. Let's try again.

From clue 1 and clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house and the history book buff lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person with a television. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with a television must be in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a phone. Since the person with a television is in the second house, the person with a computer must be in the third house, and the person with a phone must be in the first house.

Now, let's think about the person who likes science fiction. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the history book buff is in the third house, and the person with a computer is in the third house, the person who likes science fiction must be in the second house.

So, the person who likes science fiction lives in the second house.

The correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"I don't think someone with St. Vitus's Dance would win a ballet competition. They have a sickness that makes their body move in weird ways, like dancing, but it's not something they can control. They can't dance on purpose like a ballet dancer does."
"Pig Latin is a fun language game. It's not a real language, but we can play it. To play Pig Latin, you move the first sound of a word to the end and add ""ay."" For example, ""hello"" becomes ""ellohay."" I think pigs can learn to do this too. They can learn to make sounds and mimic words. So, I think it's possible for pigs to use Pig Latin. 

The answer is (A) No."
"Ringo Starr is a famous drummer from the Beatles. I don't think he would avoid the pot roast at a restaurant. He likes to eat, and pot roast is a yummy food."
"The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany. The big stadium they used was called the Olympiastadion. It could hold about 100,000 people. But a Super Bowl is a really big event, and it needs a lot of seats. The biggest Super Bowl had about 98,179 people, and the average one has around 63,000 to 70,000 people. So, the Olympiastadion is not big enough for a Super Bowl crowd. 

The answer is (B) Yes."
"Brown rock fish are found in the waters surrounding many islands in the Caribbean. Saint Kitts and Nevis is a small island nation in the Caribbean Sea. They have beautiful beaches and coral reefs. Fish like brown rock fish like to live in coral reefs. So, the answer is:

"Growing seedless cucumbers can be a bit tricky. They don't have seeds, but they still need some care. Sometimes, they get sick or get eaten by bugs. If you're scared of bugs, it might be hard to take care of them. So, I think it's not a good idea for someone with entomophobia to grow seedless cucumbers."
"If Martin Luther posted one thesis a day, he would not run out of theses in half a year. 

To find out how many days it would take to run out of theses, we need to divide the number of theses by the number of theses he posts per day. 

There are 95 theses and he posts 1 thesis per day. 

95 ÷ 1 = 95 days

Since there are 365 days in a year, half a year would be 365 / 2 = 182.5 days. 

95 days is less than 182.5 days, so Martin Luther would not run out of theses in half a year.

The answer is (B) No."
"Waltz is less injurious than slam dance. This is because waltz is a slow dance where you move your feet in a circle. It's like walking around in a big circle. You don't jump or run around, so you don't get hurt easily.

Slam dance is different. It's a fast dance where you jump and move your body a lot. You might bump into other people or fall down, which can hurt you. So, waltz is safer than slam dance."
"A: (B) No

You see, the 1943-S penny is made of zinc. It's not made of silver, so we can't use it to make silverware. Silverware is made from silver, and the 1943-S penny doesn't have any silver in it."
"It's not possible to snowboard on Venus. The reason is that it's too hot there. The temperature on Venus is really, really hot - it's over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. That's hotter than a fire! And it's also covered in thick clouds and ash, so there's no snow. Snowboarding needs snow, and Venus doesn't have any. So, the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"Charlemagne's dad was Pepin the Short. He died a long time ago, in 768. The Battle of Tours happened in 732. That means Pepin the Short wasn't alive when the Battle of Tours took place. So, he wasn't involved in the battle."
"I know that Nissan is a Japanese company. In Japan, people often use chopsticks to eat. So, I think workers at Nissan's headquarters might eat with chopsticks. 

The answer is (B) Yes."
"Hermes is a god from Greek mythology. He's the messenger of the gods and is often shown with wings on his feet. He's also the god of trade and travelers.

Vulcan is a god from Roman mythology. He's the god of fire and volcanoes. He's also the god of blacksmiths, which means he's good at making things with metal.

So, Hermes and Vulcan are not the same god. They have different jobs and are from different mythologies."
"Ariana Grande is a singer. She got hurt in a bad place where people were being mean. She talked about it and said she has a problem called PTSD. That's a big word that means she's scared sometimes. She wants to help people know it's okay to talk about their feelings. So, yes, she's a topic that's relevant to talking about PTSD."
"Jack Black is an actor, and Bear McCreary is a music composer. I don't think Jack Black would win an award for composing music because he's not a music composer. Bear McCreary is good at making music for movies and TV shows, so I think Jack Black is unlikely to compete with him for an award. 

The answer is (B) Yes."
"Are all cucumbers the same texture?

No, they are not. I have seen different kinds of cucumbers at the market. Some are long and thin, some are short and fat. Some are good for eating fresh, and some are good for making pickles. They all taste a little bit different too."
"Rick and Morty is a TV show. It's about a guy named Rick and his grandson Morty. They go on adventures. Some people might think it's not good for kids because it has some bad things in it. Like, Rick drinks a lot and it's not good for him. Some kids might see that and think it's okay to drink too. But it's not. It's not good for anyone. So, I think it could be bad for kids who have parents who drink too much."
"Simon Cowell is a person who helps pick winners on TV shows. He picks singers or dancers to win prizes. He doesn't have anything to do with the government. The government picks judges for the Supreme Court. So, Simon Cowell can't vote for the next Supreme Court judge.

The answer is (A) No."
"Jack Dempsey was a boxer a long time ago. He was a famous boxer, but he's not alive anymore. Conor McGregor is a boxer too, but he's alive and fights in a different kind of fighting, called mixed martial arts. Since Jack Dempsey is not alive, he can't watch Conor McGregor's fights. 

The answer is (A) No."
I don't know if Amy Winehouse liked Star Wars: Rogue One. I don't think she was a fan of that movie.
"Euphoria is a happy feeling. It's like when you get a new toy or win a game. But sometimes, some people get euphoria from taking bad things, like drugs. They might feel happy for a little while, but it's not good for them. It's like eating too much candy – it might taste good, but it's not good for your body.

So, the answer is: (A) Yes"
"I don't think the Apollos can beat the D'Artagnans. The Apollos are like, from Greek myths, and they're good at music and stuff. They're not really fighters. The D'Artagnans are from a book, and they're good at sword fighting. They're like, heroes. So, I think the D'Artagnans would win. 

The answer is (A) No."
Sunscreen is good for keeping our skin safe from the sun. It helps prevent sunburns and skin damage. But it's not good for treating skin cancer. Skin cancer is when bad cells grow in our skin. Sunscreen can't fix that. It can only help prevent it from happening in the first place.
"The French Defence is a way to start a game of chess. It's when you play the move e6 after your opponent plays e4. But, I don't think it can stop a four-move checkmate. A four-move checkmate is when you checkmate your opponent in just four moves. It's like a trick that can happen if you play some special moves. 

In the French Defence, you play e6, and then your opponent can play some moves that will make it hard for you to stop the checkmate. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"I don't think it's a good idea to drink week-old chlorine water. Chlorine is used to kill bad germs in the water, but it can be bad for you if it's too strong. If the water has been sitting around for a week, the chlorine might not be strong enough to kill the bad germs anymore. It's like when you leave your toys outside in the rain, they get all dirty and yucky. The water might get dirty too.

So, I think the answer is:

Tibetan Buddhism is a type of Buddhism that started in Tibet. The Himalayas are very important in Tibetan Buddhism. Many monasteries and special places are there.

"Q: Is 500GB USB device enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day?

To find out if a 500GB USB device is enough, we need to know how much space each hour of video takes up. My friend told me that a 1-hour video takes up about 2.5 to 3 GB of space. 

Let's use 2.5 GB per hour. If we have 10 hours of video, we need to multiply 10 hours by 2.5 GB per hour. 

10 hours × 2.5 GB/hour = 25 GB

Since 500GB is less than 25 GB, the answer is:

(A) No"

A scientific revolution is when we learn something new and big about the world, like how the Earth goes around the Sun or how living things grow. The iPhone is just a new way to use computers and talk to people. It's not a big change in how we think about the world.

I don't know much about Egyptian myths, but I do know that they have their own stories about gods and goddesses.

"I don't think Michael Bloomberg can pay off Micronesia's debt for 10 years. I don't know how much money Micronesia owes, but I do know that Michael Bloomberg is a rich man. He made a lot of money from his company, Bloomberg. But even if he's super rich, I don't think he can pay off a country's debt.

Let's say Micronesia owes a lot of money, like $100 million. If we want to know how much it would cost to pay that off in 10 years, we can use a simple math problem. If we assume the interest rate is 5%, it would be like this:

$100,000,000 x 1.05 (5% interest) = $105,000,000 (after 1 year)
$105,000,000 x 1.05 (5% interest) = $110,250,000 (after 2 years)
...
$100,000,000 x 1.05^10 (5% interest for 10 years) = $163,922,000

So, it would cost around $163,922,000 to pay off Micronesia's debt in 10 years. That's a lot of money! I don't think Michael Bloomberg has that much money.

If you think about it, Mount Fuji is really tall, and the Sea of Japan is not that deep. It's about 3,900 meters deep, but Mount Fuji is taller than that. So, if you put Mount Fuji in the Sea of Japan, the top of the mountain would stick out of the water."

"I think Ashland, Oregon is too small to be a big military place. It's a small town with not many people. I think it would be hard to find enough people to be in a big military group. The population of Ashland is about 21,000 people. That's not enough for a big military division.

A: (A) Yes

Thanksgiving is a special day in the United States. Some people think it's a happy day to be with family and friends, but others think it's a sad day.

Now, some Native Americans remember this sad time on Thanksgiving. They call it a day of mourning. It's a way for them to think about their ancestors and the hard times they went through."
"Q: Was England directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict?

A: Yes, England was involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict.

England, or the United Kingdom, played a big role in the creation of the State of Israel. A long time ago, in 1917, the UK said they wanted a ""home for the Jewish people"" in a place called Palestine. This was called the Balfour Declaration. Later, the UK got to be in charge of Palestine for a while, but they didn't make everyone happy. Some people who lived there, the Arabs, didn't want the Jewish people to have their own country.

The UK helped create a plan to divide Palestine into two countries, one for the Jewish people and one for the Arabs. But the Arabs didn't agree with this plan, and it led to a big war. The UK left Palestine in 1948, and that's when the State of Israel was created.

"Ocelots are super fast. They can run really, really fast. I think they can run faster than a kindergartner. Kindergartners are little kids, and they can run, but not as fast as an ocelot.

"I don't think you can watch all of JAG in six months. JAG is a TV show with lots of episodes. If you watch 30 minutes of TV each day, it would take you a really long time to watch all the episodes.

Let's do some math to figure it out. There are 180 days in six months. If you watch 30 minutes of TV each day, that's 180 x 30 = 5,400 minutes. But JAG has lots of episodes, and each episode is about 30 minutes long. So, if you multiply the number of minutes in six months by the number of episodes, it's a really big number.

Let's say there are 250 episodes of JAG. That's 250 x 30 = 7,500 minutes. If you want to watch all the episodes, it would take you a lot longer than six months. It would take you more than 7,500 minutes to watch all the episodes, and you only have 5,400 minutes in six months.

(B) No"
Cambodia is a nice place. I think it's not too expensive for a rich person to own. They can buy a big house or a hotel there. The rich people can afford it.
"I don't think the 40th president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, sent lolcats to his friends. I don't know what lolcats are, but I think they're something people make on the computer. They're funny pictures of cats with funny words. But that was a long time ago when Ronald Reagan was president, and I don't think people were making those pictures back then. 

The answer is (B) No."
"In Ancient Greece, there were lots of small cities that were like states. They were called city-states. Some of them were Athens and Sparta. There were a lot of city-states, around 1,500 to 2,000. In the United States in 1900, there were 45 states. So, the number of city-states in Ancient Greece was way more than the number of states in the United States in 1900. 

The answer is (A) Yes."
"Douglas fir is a type of tree that grows in many places. It's a strong and useful tree. 

We use Douglas fir for many things, like building houses and making paper. But did you know that it's also been used in wars?

Yes, Douglas fir has been used in wars. Here's how:

- We used it to build ships. Ships are big boats that sail on the water. They need strong wood to keep them from breaking. Douglas fir is strong, so it was a good choice.
- We also used it to build planes. Planes are machines that fly in the air. They need strong wood to keep them from breaking too.
- And we used it to make paper. Paper is used for lots of things, like writing and drawing. We needed a lot of paper during wars, so we used Douglas fir to make it.

So, the answer is: (A) Yes"
"Basil is a yummy herb that we use in cooking. But, I don't think it's safe from something called hypervitaminosis D. Hypervitaminosis D is when you get too much vitamin D. Basil doesn't have a lot of vitamin D in it, but if the soil it's grown in has too much vitamin D, then maybe the basil could have too much vitamin D too. But I'm not really sure about that. 

So, I would say that basil is not safe from hypervitaminosis D. The answer is (B) No."
"Christopher Columbus was a sailor who sailed across the ocean a long time ago. He went to the Americas, which is a big landmass in the Western Hemisphere. He sailed to many islands in the Caribbean and even reached the mainland of South America. But, he never went to Antarctica. Antarctica is a cold place at the bottom of the world, and it was not known to Europeans during Columbus's time."
"A sofer is a person who writes and fixes special books. They use special paper called parchment. This paper is made from animal skin. But, a sofer doesn't hurt animals. They just use the skin that people already have. So, a vegan can still be a sofer if they want to."
"Aristotle was a very smart man who lived a long time ago. He was a teacher and a philosopher. He didn't live in a place called the House of Lords. The House of Lords is a place where important people in the UK make decisions. It was made a long time after Aristotle was alive. So, the answer is:

(B) No"

Chinchillas live in the mountains in South America and are very good at climbing. They have soft fur and are very cute. So, the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"The Nazis used a special flag with a big swastika on it. The swastika is a special symbol that looks like a cross with four arms. It's a very important symbol for the Nazis. The Hammer and Sickle is a different symbol. It's a hammer and a sickle crossed over each other, and it's a symbol for communism. So, the answer is:

(B) No"

"Having a lip piercing doesn't usually make your dental bills more expensive. But, it's possible that it might cause some problems. 

If you don't take good care of your piercing, it can get infected. This can hurt your teeth and gums. You might need to go to the dentist to fix it. But, it's not because of the piercing itself, it's because of not taking care of it.

So, the answer is: (B) No"

"Alexander the Great was a king who lived a long time ago. He was from a place called Macedonia. He was a great leader and conquered many lands. I don't think he was baptized. Baptism is when you get water poured on your head to join a church, and that didn't happen back then. Alexander believed in many gods and goddesses from ancient Greece."
"I think an American might get confused between breakfast and dinner in British food. In the UK, they have big breakfasts with bacon, eggs, and sausages. That's a lot of food for the morning. In America, they usually have cereal or pancakes for breakfast. So, if an American saw a big British breakfast, they might think it's dinner."
"A white cockatoo is a big bird. They live a long time, but not that long. They can live up to 60 years in the wild and 80 years in a zoo. The Thirty Years' War was a long time ago, from 1618 to 1648. If a white cockatoo was born in 1618, it would be very old by the time the war ended. But it's not possible for a white cockatoo to live that long. So, the answer is:

(B) No"

"A: (B) No

I don't think a birdwatcher would go to a football game. They like to watch birds, not play football. They like to go outside and look at birds in the trees and in the air. A football game is a loud place with lots of people, and it's not a good place to see birds."
"I don't know who Cheb Mami is, but I think he can win a Pulitzer Prize. The Pulitzer Prize is a big award for good work in many things, like music, writing, and more. It's like a prize for being the best. So, if Cheb Mami makes good music, he might get a Pulitzer Prize. 

The answer is (A) No."
"The swallow is in a famous film about King Arthur. I think it's in the movie ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". They talk about the bird, the swallow, in the movie."
"You can't make an MP3 from the Golden Gate Bridge. It's a big bridge in San Francisco, and it's not a sound or music. We can make music or sounds from things like guitars, drums, or even our voices, but not from a big bridge."
"I don't think it's more expensive to run for President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11. The cost of running for President of India is very high, but it's not as high as buying a new house or a big car. I think it's like buying many, many iPhones 11."
"I think a deacon might like the podcast 'God Awful Movies'. They like movies, and it's funny."
"Ben & Jerry's is a yummy ice cream company. I know a little bit about it. The two guys who started it are not in charge anymore. They sold the company to a big company called Unilever. Now, they don't run the company, but they still help out sometimes.

"I don't think people in their 40s have little memory capacity. My grandma is 45 and she remembers lots of things from when I was little. She remembers my birthday and my mom's birthday, and she even remembers my favorite food. I think it's just that people get older and their brains might get a little slower, but that doesn't mean they can't remember things."
"Harry Potter was a super popular movie series. It made a lot of money for Warner Bros. The first movie came out in 2001 and made over $974 million. The last movie made over $1.34 billion. That's a lot of money.

The Matrix was also a popular movie series. The first movie came out in 1999 and made over $463 million. The last movie made over $427 million. That's a lot of money too.

But if we add up all the money that Harry Potter made, it's way more than The Matrix. So, Harry Potter was a better investment for Warner Bros."
"Professional boxers get hurt a lot in their teeth. They get hit in the mouth, and it can break their teeth. They might need to go to the dentist a lot to fix their teeth. So, they probably won't have low dental bills. 

The answer is (B) No."
"Queen Elizabeth I was a queen a long time ago. She lived from 1533 to 1603. Jean-Paul Sartre was a person who wrote books and stuff, but he lived a long time after Queen Elizabeth I. He was born in 1905 and died in 1980. So, Queen Elizabeth I couldn't have read his books because she was already dead when he was born. 

The answer is (A) No."
"Open heart surgery is a big operation that doctors do to fix a person's heart. It can take a long time, like 3 to 6 hours. Swan Lake is a ballet show that people watch. It's like a dance performance. It has two parts, and it takes about 2-3 hours to finish, including breaks in between.

So, Swan Lake is longer than open heart surgery. That means open heart surgery will finish before Swan Lake is over. 

The answer is (B) No."
"A jet plane is a big machine that flies in the air. It needs many things to be made, like metal, engines, and wings. We need people to make these things, and we need a place to make them. We also need roads and trucks to move the parts to the place where the plane is being made. And when the plane is finished, we need airports and people to fly it.

So, we need a lot of things that are made by people and that people use. That's what we call society. Without society, we wouldn't have all these things, and we couldn't make a jet plane.

So, the answer is: (B) No"
"Horoscopes are like fun predictions about what might happen to you based on the stars and planets. Astronomers are people who study the stars and planets, but they don't write horoscopes. They're more like scientists who try to figure out how the universe works. They don't really care about making predictions about people's futures. So, the answer is:

(A) No"
"I think Lhamo Thondup is a very special person. I heard she was a kind nun who helped people. She was from a different religion, but the Pope, who is a very important person in the Catholic Church, said she was a saint. So, I think the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"A: (B) No

Sesame seeds are small and flat, and they look different from wood frog eggs. Wood frog eggs are round and have a jelly-like coating. They are also pretty small, about 1-2 mm in size. I don't think sesame seeds would be mistaken for wood frog eggs because they look really different."
"I think I know the answer to your question. Pink Floyd is a famous rock band, and they have a lot of great songs. One of their songs is called ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond.""

They could even trade and help make decisions in their community. In England, serfs were not as lucky. They had to work a lot for their lord and didn't have as many rights. So, Japanese serfdom was better than English serfdom."

So, the answer is:

(B) No"

"Let's figure out who has what gift at the end.

First, Fred and Eve swap gifts. Fred has a brown present, and Eve has a red present. Now, Fred has the red present, and Eve has the brown present.

Next, Bob and Gertrude swap gifts. Bob has an orange ball, and Gertrude has a pink ball. Now, Bob has the pink ball, and Gertrude has the orange ball.

Then, Alice and Claire swap gifts. Alice has a green present, and Claire has a black ball. Now, Alice has the black ball, and Claire has the green present.

After that, Dave and Fred swap gifts. Dave has a blue present, and Fred has a red present. Now, Dave has the red present, and Fred has the blue present.

Next, Alice and Fred swap gifts. Alice has a black ball, and Fred has a blue present. Now, Alice has the blue present, and Fred has the black ball.

Finally, Alice and Eve swap gifts. Alice has a blue present, and Eve has a red present. Now, Alice has the red present, and Eve has the blue present.

So, let's see who has what gift at the end. We know Bob has the pink ball. The other people have the following gifts: Alice has the red present, Dave has the brown present, Eve has the blue present, Fred has the black ball, and Gertrude has the orange ball. 

The correct answer is (C) pink ball."
"Let's figure out who Eve is dancing with at the end of the dance.

First, we need to know who Eve is dancing with at the start. Eve is dancing with Melissa.

Then, some people switch partners. Let's follow the order:

1. Claire and Bob switch partners. This means Claire is now dancing with Bob, and Bob is now dancing with Claire. Eve is still dancing with Melissa.

2. Alice and Eve switch partners. Now, Alice is dancing with Eve, and Eve is dancing with Alice.

3. Fred and Bob switch partners. Now, Fred is dancing with Bob, and Bob is dancing with Fred. Eve is still dancing with Alice.

4. Dave and Bob switch partners. Now, Dave is dancing with Bob, and Bob is dancing with Dave. Eve is still dancing with Alice.

5. Claire and Gertrude switch partners. Now, Claire is dancing with Gertrude, and Gertrude is dancing with Claire. Eve is still dancing with Alice.

3. Eve and Claire swap gifts. Now Eve has the black ball, and Claire has the purple present.
4. Dave and Alice swap gifts. Now Dave has the black ball, and Alice has the blue present.

6. Gertrude and Eve swap gifts. Now Gertrude has the black ball, and Eve has the blue present.
7. Fred and Bob swap gifts. Now Fred has the yellow present, and Bob has the white present.

So, at the end of the event, **(F) yellow present** is not correct, and **(G) brown present** is not correct. We know that Gertrude has the black ball, and Eve has the blue present. We also know that Alice has the brown present, and Dave has the black ball. Now, let's look at the options again.

The correct answer is **(B) purple present** is not correct, and **(D) blue present** is not correct. We know that Bob has the white present, and Fred has the yellow present. So, the correct answer is **(A) white present** is not correct, but we know that Bob has the white present."
"Let's figure out who Fred is dancing with at the end of the dance.

First, we know that Fred is dancing with Sam at the start. Then, Fred and Alice switch partners. Now, Fred is dancing with Alice, and Alice is dancing with Sam.

Next, Eve and Gertrude switch partners. This doesn't change who Fred is dancing with, so Fred is still dancing with Alice.

Then, Claire and Eve switch partners. This also doesn't change who Fred is dancing with, so Fred is still dancing with Alice.

After that, Fred and Dave switch partners. Now, Fred is dancing with Dave, and Dave is dancing with Melissa. But this doesn't change who Fred is dancing with, so Fred is still dancing with Dave.

Next, Claire and Alice switch partners. This doesn't change who Fred is dancing with, so Fred is still dancing with Dave.

Then, Fred and Gertrude switch partners. Now, Fred is dancing with Gertrude, and Gertrude is dancing with Dave. But this doesn't change who Fred is dancing with, so Fred is still dancing with Gertrude.

Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. This doesn't change who Fred is dancing with, so Fred is still dancing with Gertrude.

So, at the end of the dance, Fred is dancing with Gertrude. The correct answer is (D) Ophelia."
"Let's figure out who Eve is dancing with at the end of the dance.

First, we know Eve is dancing with Rodrigo at the start. Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners. Now Eve is dancing with Melissa.

After that, Gertrude and Bob switch partners. Now Gertrude is dancing with Bob, but Eve is still dancing with Melissa.

Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. This doesn't change Eve's partner.

Next, Dave and Alice switch partners. Now Dave is dancing with Alice, but Eve is still dancing with Melissa.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with Claire. And Claire is dancing with Sam. But we don't know who Sam is dancing with.

"Let's figure out who has the ball at the end of the game. We have seven people: Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude. Each person has a different colored ball: blue, orange, black, brown, pink, white, and purple.

First, Alice and Fred swap balls. Now, Fred has the blue ball, and Alice has the white ball.

Next, Dave and Fred swap balls. Now, Fred has the brown ball, and Dave has the white ball.

Then, Eve and Gertrude swap balls. This doesn't change Fred's ball.

After that, Dave and Claire swap balls. This doesn't change Fred's ball.

Next, Claire and Bob swap balls. This doesn't change Fred's ball.

Then, Dave and Alice swap balls. Now, Dave has the blue ball, and Alice has the brown ball. Fred still has the brown ball.

Finally, Bob and Fred swap balls. Now, Fred has the orange ball, and Bob has the brown ball.

So, at the end of the game, Fred has the orange ball. The correct answer is (B)."

So, the answer is (E)."
"Let's figure out who has the ball at the end of the game. We can follow the order of the ball trades:

1. Gertrude and Alice swap balls. Gertrude gets the purple ball, and Alice gets the blue ball.

2. Fred and Bob swap balls. Fred gets the pink ball, and Bob gets the green ball.

(A) green ball."
"Let's figure out where Bob is playing at the end of the soccer match.

First, Eve and Fred trade positions. Eve was the goalkeeper, and Fred was the center midfielder. Now Eve is the center midfielder, and Fred is the goalkeeper.

Next, Bob and Claire trade positions. Bob was the cheerleader, and Claire was the right winger. Now Bob is the right winger, and Claire is the cheerleader.

Then, Bob and Fred trade positions. Bob is the right winger, and Fred is the center midfielder. But wait, we already knew that! So, Bob is still the right winger.

After that, Gertrude and Alice trade positions. Gertrude was the benchwarmer, and Alice was the left midfielder. Now Gertrude is the left midfielder, and Alice is the benchwarmer.

Next, Eve and Alice trade positions. Eve is the center midfielder, and Alice is the benchwarmer. But we already knew that Eve was the center midfielder, so this doesn't change anything.

Then, Eve and Dave trade positions. Eve is the center midfielder, and Dave is the fullback. But we already knew that Eve was the center midfielder, so this doesn't change anything.

Finally, Fred and Bob trade positions. Fred is the right winger, and Bob is the center midfielder. But we already knew that Bob was the right winger, so this doesn't change anything.

So, at the end of the match, Bob is playing right winger. The correct answer is (A)."
"Let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end of the dance.

- Alice is dancing with Karl.
- Bob is dancing with Helga.
- Claire is dancing with Sam.
- Dave is dancing with Rodrigo.
- Eve is dancing with Melissa.
- Fred is dancing with Izzi.
- Gertrude is dancing with Ophelia.

Now, let's see what happens during the dance:

1. Gertrude and Fred switch partners. This means Gertrude is now dancing with Fred, and Fred is dancing with Gertrude. But this doesn't change who Alice is dancing with.
2. Gertrude and Bob switch partners. Now, Gertrude is dancing with Bob, and Bob is dancing with Gertrude. Still, this doesn't change who Alice is dancing with.
3. Alice and Bob switch partners. Now, Alice is dancing with Bob, and Bob is dancing with Alice. But we still don't know who Alice is dancing with at the end.
4. Eve and Dave switch partners. This doesn't change who Alice is dancing with.
5. Bob and Gertrude switch partners. Now, Bob is dancing with Gertrude again, but this time Gertrude is dancing with Bob. So, Alice is now dancing with Bob, and Bob is dancing with Gertrude. But we still don't know who Alice is dancing with at the end.
6. Alice and Claire switch partners. Now, Alice is dancing with Claire, and Claire is dancing with Alice. But we still don't know who Alice is dancing with at the end.
7. Dave and Fred switch partners. This doesn't change who Alice is dancing with.

So, let's think about who Alice was dancing with before the last switch. She was dancing with Claire. But Claire was dancing with Sam before that. So, Alice must be dancing with Sam at the end of the dance.

The correct answer is (F) Sam."
"Let's figure out who has the ball at the end. 

First, Alice and Fred swap balls. Alice gets the pink ball, and Fred gets the green ball.

Then, Dave and Fred swap balls. Dave gets the pink ball, and Fred gets the purple ball. Alice still has the pink ball.

Next, Fred and Claire swap balls. Fred gets the orange ball, and Claire gets the pink ball. Alice still has the pink ball.

Finally, Claire and Bob swap balls. Claire gets the black ball, and Bob gets the pink ball. But wait, Alice still has the pink ball.

So, at the end of the game, Alice has the pink ball.

The correct answer is (B) pink ball."
"Let's figure out who Gertrude is dancing with at the end of the dance.

First, we need to know who Gertrude is dancing with at the start. Gertrude is dancing with Karl.

Then, some people switch partners. 

1. Fred and Bob switch partners. This doesn't change Gertrude's partner.
2. Alice and Eve switch partners. This doesn't change Gertrude's partner.
3. Alice and Gertrude switch partners. Now, Gertrude is dancing with Alice.
4. Bob and Gertrude switch partners. Now, Gertrude is dancing with Bob.
5. Fred and Alice switch partners. Now, Alice is dancing with Fred, and Gertrude is still dancing with Bob.
6. Fred and Claire switch partners. This doesn't change Gertrude's partner.
7. Dave and Bob switch partners. Now, Bob is dancing with Dave, and Gertrude is dancing with Dave.

So, at the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with Dave's partner. We need to find out who Dave's partner is. At the start, Dave was dancing with Lola. So, Gertrude is dancing with Lola.

The answer is (A) Lola."
"Let's figure out who Dave is dancing with at the end of the dance.

At the start, Dave is dancing with Izzi.

Then, some people switch partners. 

1. Alice and Claire switch partners. This doesn't change Dave's partner.
2. Bob and Fred switch partners. This doesn't change Dave's partner.
3. Claire and Dave switch partners. Now Dave is dancing with Claire.
4. Alice and Fred switch partners. This doesn't change Dave's partner.
5. Claire and Alice switch partners. Now Claire is dancing with Alice, and Alice is dancing with Fred. Dave is still dancing with Claire.
6. Bob and Eve switch partners. This doesn't change Dave's partner.
7. Eve and Gertrude switch partners. This doesn't change Dave's partner.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is still dancing with Claire. But Claire was dancing with Jamie at the start. Since Claire and Dave switched partners in step 3, and Claire and Alice switched partners in step 5, Claire is now dancing with Alice. But Alice was dancing with Lola at the start. So, Claire is dancing with Lola.

Since Dave is dancing with Claire, and Claire is dancing with Lola, Dave is dancing with Lola.

The correct answer is (A) Lola."

Then, Eve and Alice swap gifts. Eve gets Alice's white present, and Alice gets Eve's brown present.

Finally, Fred and Claire swap gifts. Fred gets Claire's orange ball, and Claire gets Fred's white present.

So, let's see who has what gift now. We know that Dave got Alice's blue present, and Alice got Eve's brown present. Eve got Fred's white present, and Fred got Claire's orange ball. Claire got Fred's white present, but we already know that Eve has the white present, so Claire must have the brown present. Gertrude got Alice's pink ball, and Bob got Alice's red present.

They swapped again, and then Dave and Fred swapped, but that didn't change Gertrude's gift. Then, Claire and Dave swapped, and Bob and Dave swapped, but Gertrude didn't swap gifts with anyone else. So, Gertrude still has the pink ball.

The answer is (E)."
