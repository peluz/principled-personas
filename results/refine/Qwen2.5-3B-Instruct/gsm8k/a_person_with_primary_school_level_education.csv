"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so that leaves 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.
3. She uses 4 eggs to make muffins, so that leaves 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.
4. She sells each of the remaining eggs for $2.
5. So, she makes 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

The amount of money she makes every day at the farmers' market is $18. The correct answer is:

C. $18"
"To find out how many bolts of fiber are needed for the robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber.

1. The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber, so it needs \(2 \div 2 = 1\) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together:
\[2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}\]

So, the robe needs a total of 3 bolts of fiber. The correct answer is:

C"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Josh bought a house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on fixing it. So, the total cost was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Then, the house's value increased by 150%. To find out how much that is, we calculate 150% of $130,000. 150% is the same as 1.5, so we do 1.5 times $130,000, which is 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000.

So, the new value of the house is $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000.

To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the original cost from the new value: $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000.

So, Josh made a profit of $195,000.

The correct answer is:
B. $195,000"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

James runs 3 sprints each time. Each sprint is 60 meters. So, if he runs 3 sprints, he runs:
\[ 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

He does this 3 times a week. So, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed every day. So, for 20 chickens, she needs:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is left for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5. Every second glass costs only 60% of $5. So, let's find out how much the second glass costs:
- The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Now, we can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs (because 16 divided by 2 is 8). So, the total cost for 8 pairs is:
- 8 pairs at $8 each = $8 \times 8 = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

The correct answer is C. $64."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

We know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Now, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we calculate how many sheep Charleston has:

Charleston's sheep = 4 times Seattle's sheep
Charleston's sheep = 4 times 20
Charleston's sheep = 80

Next, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we calculate how many sheep Toulouse has:

Toulouse's sheep = 2 times Charleston's sheep
Toulouse's sheep = 2 times 80
Toulouse's sheep = 160

Now, to find out how many sheep there are in total, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse:

Total sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260. The correct answer is:

\boxed{260}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carla is downloading a big file that is 200 GB. She can download 2 GB every minute. First, she downloads 40% of the file. 

40% of 200 GB is:
\[ 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

If she can download 2 GB every minute, then to download 80 GB, it will take:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After she downloads 80 GB, her computer restarts to update Windows. This restart takes 20 minutes. Then she has to start downloading the rest of the file from the beginning.

The rest of the file is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ GB} \]

If she can download 2 GB every minute, then to download 120 GB, it will take:
\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add up all the time:
- Time to download 80 GB: 40 minutes
- Time for the restart: 20 minutes
- Time to download the rest: 60 minutes

So, the total time is:
\[ 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes. 

The correct answer is:

"Let's break down John's journey step by step to find out how far he is from home at the end of 4 hours.

1. **First part of the journey:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered in this part: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second part of the journey:**
   - John spends 2 hours in traffic.
   - Distance covered in this part: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third part of the journey:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
   - Distance covered in this part: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Fourth part of the journey:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at 80 mph.
   - Time left: \(4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).
   - Distance covered in this part: \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

Now, let's add up all the distances:
- Distance from the first part: 180 miles.
- Distance from the second part: 0 miles.
- Distance from the third part: 15 miles.
- Distance from the fourth part: 120 miles.

Total distance from home: \(180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 \text{ miles}\).

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{315}\) miles from home."
"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to calculate her earnings from regular hours and overtime hours.

First, let's calculate her earnings from regular hours:
- Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
- She worked 40 hours at this rate.
- So, her earnings from regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from overtime hours:
- Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
- Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
- So, her overtime rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour.
- Her earnings from overtime = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Now, let's add her earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to find her total earnings:
- Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

So, Eliza earned $460 this week. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

In the first month, the program got 60 downloads.

In the second month, it got three times as many as the first month. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]
So, in the second month, it got 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%. To find out how many that is, we calculate 30% of 180:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \]
So, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 - 54 = 126 \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if not provided, the correct answer is 366.)"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Toula bought different kinds of pastries at a bakery. She bought 3 dozen donuts, 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes. We need to find out how much she spent in total.

First, let's find out how much she spent on each type of pastry:

1. Donuts:
   - She bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, 3 dozen cost \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. Mini cupcakes:
   - She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, 2 dozen cost \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. Mini cheesecakes:
   - She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, 6 dozen cost \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Donuts cost $204.
- Mini cupcakes cost $160.
- Mini cheesecakes cost $330.

So, the total cost is \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

The total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to look at the costs and the money he makes each year.

First, let's look at the costs:
- The tree costs $90 to plant.
- Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree.
- Each year, the tree gives him 7 lemons, and each lemon is sold for $1.5.

Now, let's see how much money Carlos makes each year:
- He sells 7 lemons, and each lemon is sold for $1.5, so he makes $1.5 * 7 = $10.5 each year.
- But he also spends $3 each year on water and feeding the tree.

So, the money he makes each year after spending on water and feeding is:
- $10.5 (from selling lemons) - $3 (for water and feeding) = $7.5 each year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to make back the $90 he spent to plant the tree. We do this by dividing the cost by the money he makes each year:
- $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree.

The correct answer is C."
"Let's solve this step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. That means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners, where \( x \) is the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with.

After selling at the green house, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then she sold 2 more at the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

2. Distribute the \( \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]

3. Simplify the terms:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

4. Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

5. Add 1 to both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

6. Multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

We have 20 students in total. First, we find out how many students are in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 is 4 students. So, 4 students are in contemporary dance.

Now, we subtract those 4 students from the total to find out how many are left: 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 16 students are in jazz dance. 25% of 16 is 4 students. So, 4 students are in jazz dance.

Now, we subtract those 4 students from the remaining 16 to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance: 16 - 4 = 12 students.

So, 12 students are in hip-hop dance. To find out what percentage 12 is of the total 20 students, we do the following:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the students are in hip-hop dance. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}

"To decide which purchase to make, we need to see how much each item will be worth after the market increases.

1. Jewelry:
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   - Profit from jewelry = Future value - Current value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. Electronic Gadgets:
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value - Current value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Now, we compare the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The higher profit is from the jewelry, so the merchant should buy the jewelry to maximize profit.

The correct answer is:
A. $125"
"To find the total distance each train traveled, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The train traveled 80 miles west.
2. The train also traveled 150 miles north.

Now, we add these two distances together:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance each train traveled in the two days is 230 miles. The correct answer is:

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate how much she earns from teaching and coaching each year and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate her teaching earnings:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual teaching hours are 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year.
Her annual teaching earnings are 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year.

Next, let's calculate her coaching earnings:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual coaching hours are 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year.
Her annual coaching earnings are 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year.

Now, we add her teaching and coaching earnings to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

The correct answer is C. $57,500."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we can find out how many dozens of eggs 84 eggs make:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

So, Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Marissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 miles in another hour. So, she has walked a total of 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. She wants to walk the remaining 12 - 6 = 6 miles in the last hour to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find out the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

So, the speed she needs is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is 6 miles per hour.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of this is water.
   - So, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. We also have 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of this is water.
   - So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. Adding the water from both drinks:
   - Total water = 6.67 liters (orange drink) + 9 liters (pineapple drink) = 15.67 liters

4. We spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so we have:
   - Remaining orange drink = 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters

5. The total volume of the mixture is now 9 liters, and the total amount of water is still 15.67 liters.

6. To find out how much water is in the remaining 9 liters, we use the total amount of water:
   - Water in 9 liters = \(\frac{15.67}{9} \times 9 = 15.67 \text{ liters}\)

So, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters is 15.67 liters.

The correct answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

Marie ordered:
- One chicken meal for $12.
- 5 packs of milk at $3 each, so that's 5 times 3, which is 15 dollars.
- 4 apples at $1.50 each, so that's 4 times 1.50, which is 6 dollars.

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars} \]

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to add up the cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- So, the total cost for shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $59.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- So, the total cost for shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.00.

To find the total amount Mishka spent, we add up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00

Now, let's add these amounts:
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent a total of $253.00 on all the clothing items.

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Cynthia eats one scoop of ice cream every night. Each big ice cream box has 15 scoops and costs $4.00. We need to find out how much money Cynthia will spend on ice cream if she eats for 60 days.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of ice cream Cynthia will eat in 60 days. Since she eats one scoop every night, in 60 days she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ scoops} \]

Next, we need to find out how many big ice cream boxes she will need. Each box has 15 scoops, so we divide the total scoops by the scoops in one box:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ scoops}}{15 \text{ scoops/box}} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we know she needs 4 boxes of ice cream. Each box costs $4.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost of one box to find the total cost:
\[ 4 \text{ boxes} \times 4 \text{ dollars/box} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream in 60 days. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Henry's trip is 60 miles long. He stopped after 20 miles, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 miles left to go. Then he stopped again 15 miles before the end of the trip. That means he had 60 - 15 = 45 miles left to go after his first stop.

So, the distance he traveled between his first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

The answer is 25 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Gloria has two pairs of high heels. One pair costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so the other pair costs $66. Together, the two pairs of high heels cost:

\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

The problem says that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if we let the cost of the boots be \( B \), then:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11, and their total age is 162. We need to find out how old Allen will be 10 years from now.

First, let's find out how old Darrell and Allen are now. We can say Darrell's age is 7 parts and Allen's age is 11 parts. So, the total number of parts is 7 + 11 = 18 parts.

The total age is 162, so each part is equal to 162 ÷ 18 = 9 years.

Now, we can find out how old Allen is. Since Allen's age is 11 parts, he is 11 × 9 = 99 years old now.

To find out how old Allen will be 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109 years.

So, Allen will be 109 years old 10 years from now. The correct answer is:

\boxed{B} (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, but since I don't have the actual multiple-choice options, I just provided the numerical answer.)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have the guesses from three friends:
- The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guessed 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guessed 60 jelly beans.
- The third friend guessed 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding 20 to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add these guesses together:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Next, we need to find the average of these guesses. To do this, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3:
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]"
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
2. John takes care of 10 dogs, so we multiply the time it takes for one dog by the number of dogs:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]
3. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the hours John spends on one day by 7 to find out how many hours he spends in a week:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Gretchen has 110 coins in total. Let's say she has \( S \) silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of silver coins and gold coins:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we add 30 to the number of silver coins to find the number of gold coins:
\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Now, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Aaron has 25 jewels.
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]
   Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The correct answer is 23."
"Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

First, let's find 25% of 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, let's add the points from both 20-minute segments to find the total points:
\[ 4 \text{ points} + 5 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

So, the total points Mike scored are 9 points. The correct answer is:
A. 9"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. We need to find out how much he spends on yogurt over 30 days. First, we need to know how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
   \[
   2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
   \[
   \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/set}} = 15 \, \text{sets}
   \]

3. Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so we need to find out how much 15 sets cost:
   \[
   15 \, \text{sets} \times 5 \, \text{\$/set} = 75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

So, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days. The correct answer is:

\boxed{D} (Assuming D is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question format.)"
"John sells all his lego sets for $15 each. He has 13 lego sets, so he makes:

\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:

\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. So, the money he has left is:

\[ 195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

This $35 is the money he had initially from selling his lego sets. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he still has:

\[ 0 \text{ lego sets} \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is 0. The correct answer is:

**A. 0**"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to know how many miles he runs each day and how many hours he spends running each day.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs 3 days a week. So, each day he runs:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:
\[ \text{Time on other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time John spends running in a week:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find his running speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if not provided, the correct answer is 10 miles/hour.)"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. We also know that she can run four times faster than she can walk, and she can skip at half the speed she runs. So, if she skips at 3 miles per hour, she runs at:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to figure out how much time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate how far she can run in 2 hours and how far she can walk in 4 hours:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance she can travel:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 times 2, which is 8 years old.

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

The dragon, Perg, can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away. Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. But when she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, with the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet times 3, which is 1200 feet.

Now, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, and Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach she can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The correct answer is:
200 feet"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, she had a total of:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

After the guests ate, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that each bag of chips has 250 calories and it's divided into 5 servings. So, each serving has 250 calories / 5 servings = 50 calories per serving.

Next, you've already eaten 1800 calories. To find out how many more calories you can eat, we subtract the calories you've already eaten from your daily target:

2000 calories (daily target) - 1800 calories (already eaten) = 200 calories (remaining).

Now, we know each serving has 50 calories. To find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

200 calories / 50 calories per serving = 4 servings.

Since each serving is 50 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the grams per serving to find out how many grams you can eat:

4 servings * 50 grams per serving = 200 grams.

So, the number of grams you can eat is 200 grams. The correct answer is:

C. 200 grams"
"To find out how much Charlie makes from selling 20 candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how much it costs to make 20 candles. We know that 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles. So, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00, so for 2 pounds, it would be:
   \[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Now, we need to know how much money Charlie makes from selling 20 candles. If each candle is sold for $2.00, then for 20 candles, he makes:
   \[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

3. To find out the net profit, we subtract the cost from the money made:
   \[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie's net profit is $20.00. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Meredith writes articles about health topics. Each article takes her 4 hours to write. We need to find out how many hours she spent writing articles over three days.

1. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
   - So, the time spent on Monday is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

2. On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday. That means she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles.
   - So, the time spent on Tuesday is \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. That means she wrote \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.
   - So, the time spent on Wednesday is \(14 \times 4 = 56\) hours.

Now, we add up the hours spent on all three days:
- Monday: 20 hours
- Tuesday: 28 hours
- Wednesday: 56 hours

Total hours spent writing articles = \(20 + 28 + 56 = 104\) hours.

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours. The correct answer is C."
"Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used some to put on coffee cups and had 23 left. She used 220 Post-it notes for the coffee cups. To find out how many she bought, we need to add the 220 she used to the 23 she had left.

So, we do:
\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = 23 \]

To get the number she bought, we need to add the 220 she used to the 23 she had left:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

So, she bought 243 Post-it notes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{243} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, he bought 5 blue ties because:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie. Since a blue tie costs $40, a red tie costs:
\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + (0.50 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

So, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is $800. The correct answer is:

"To solve this, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces we can get from a 4-foot wire. First, we convert 4 feet to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 4 feet is 4 times 12 inches. So, 4 feet = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces we get:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}

(Note: In a multiple-choice format, B would be the correct letter option for the answer 8 pieces.)"
"To find out how many units are unoccupied, we first need to know how many units there are in total and how many are occupied.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the number of unoccupied units is 30. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs every day.
2. We also know that Lloyd sells eggs in dozens, and each dozen costs $2.
3. To find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets each day, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
   \[
   \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens}
   \]
4. Now, we know that Lloyd makes $2 for each dozen of eggs. So, we multiply the number of dozens by $2 to find out how much he makes each day:
   \[
   21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars per dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars per day}
   \]
5. To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by 7 (the number of days in a week):
   \[
   42 \text{ dollars per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 294 \text{ dollars per week}
   \]

So, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."

Tom's ship can travel 10 miles in one hour. If he travels from 1 to 4 PM, that's 3 hours. So, the distance to his destination is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Tom has to travel back at 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to travel back 30 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back. The correct answer is:

"Uriah needs to remove 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books he removes is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"To find out how much more the mechanic earned on Thursday compared to Friday, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the money earned on Thursday:
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires, and each truck tire costs $60. So, the money from truck tires is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repaired 4 car tires, and each car tire costs $40. So, the money from car tires is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total money earned on Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the money earned on Friday:
- The mechanic only repaired car tires, and each car tire costs $40. So, the money from car tires is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total money earned on Friday is \(480\) dollars.

To find out how much more the mechanic earned on Thursday, we subtract the money earned on Friday from the money earned on Thursday:
- The difference is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The correct answer is:

C"
"To find out how many kittens the Doubtfire family has now, we need to add up all the kittens they have.

First, we know that the adopted kittens are 7.

Next, we know that Patchy, the first cat, has had three times as many kittens as the adopted ones. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
Patchy has 21 kittens.

We also know that Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add all the kittens together:
\[ 7 \text{ (adopted)} + 21 \text{ (Patchy's)} + 12 \text{ (Trixie's)} = 40 \]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 40.

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Stephen ordered groceries that cost $40.00. The delivery person added a fee that was 25% of $40.00. They also added $3.00 for delivery and Stephen added a $4.00 tip.

First, let's find out how much the 25% fee is:
- 25% of $40.00 is $40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00.

So, the total cost after the 25% fee is:
- $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.

Now, add the $3.00 for delivery:
- $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

Finally, add the $4.00 tip:
- $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have a basket with 25 oranges. We know:
- 1 orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

First, we need to find out how many oranges are unripe. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we calculate:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

Now, we know the total number of oranges is 25. We have:
- 1 bad orange
- 5 unripe oranges
- 2 sour oranges

To find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total:
\[ 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17 \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Janet spent on the brooch before insurance. She spent $500 on the material and $800 on the jeweler to make it. So, we add these two amounts together:

$500 + $800 = $1300

Now, Janet has to pay 10% of $1300 to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we can do:

$1300 × 10% = $1300 × 0.10 = $130

So, the total amount Janet paid is the cost of the brooch plus the insurance cost:

$1300 + $130 = $1430

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is $1430. The correct answer is C."

Marcy works for 40 years, and she gets a pension. For the first 20 years, she gets $50,000 a year. After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of the total pension she had saved up each year.

First, we calculate how much she gets in the first 20 years:
- She gets $50,000 a year for 20 years.
- So, $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of $1,000,000 each year. So, we calculate 5% of $1,000,000:
- 5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find out how much she gets in the last 10 years:
- $50,000 (first 20 years) + $50,000 (next 10 years) = $100,000.

So, after 30 years, Marcy gets $100,000 a year. The correct answer is:

C. $100,000"
"To find out how much Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the cost for each half of the year and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year:
- There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
- The monthly charge is $140.
- So, the cost for the first half is:
  \[
  6 \times 140 = 840 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the second half of the year:
- The charge for the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
- First, find 10% of $140:
  \[
  0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Subtract this 10% from the initial amount to get the reduced charge for the second half:
  \[
  140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- So, the cost for the second half is:
  \[
  6 \times 126 = 756 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, let's add the costs for both halves of the year to find the total amount paid:
\[
840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596.

The correct answer is:
\[

"Sophia's car can hold 12 gallons of gas. She used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we first need to know how many miles she can drive with 1 gallon of gas.

If 4 gallons of gas let her drive 100 miles, then 1 gallon of gas would let her drive:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, if her car can drive 25 miles with 1 gallon of gas, then with 12 gallons of gas, she can drive:

\[ 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a full tank of gas. The correct answer is:

C. 300"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jim watches TV for 2 hours each time. He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 1 hour each time. That means in one session, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36 hours. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The treasure hunter found a chest with gems. There were 175 diamonds. The number of rubies is 35 less than the number of diamonds. So, we calculate the number of rubies:

175 (diamonds) - 35 = 140 (rubies)

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we calculate the number of emeralds:

2 × 140 = 280 (emeralds)

Now, to find out how many gems there are in total, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 605

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 605.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step as if I'm a person with primary school level education.

1. We know there are twice as many boys as girls. If there are 60 girls, then the number of boys is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]
   So, there are 120 boys.

2. Now, we need to find out the total number of students. We add the number of boys and girls:
   \[
   60 \text{ girls} + 120 \text{ boys} = 180 \text{ students}
   \]

3. We are told that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by 5:
   \[

"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her earnings from weekdays and Saturday.

First, let's calculate her earnings from weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

So, the number of students she teaches in one weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

The total number of students she teaches in 5 weekdays is:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from the weekdays are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from Saturday are:
\[ 120 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$1800.00 \]

Finally, her total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings from the weekdays and Saturday:
\[ \$5625.00 + \$1800.00 = \$7425.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to add up the money he gets from selling brownies and cheesecakes.

First, let's calculate the money from the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie costs $3.

So, the money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times 3 \text{ dollars per brownie} = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the money from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake costs $4.

So, the money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times 4 \text{ dollars per slice} = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total money Tommy raises:
\[ 129 \text{ dollars} + 92 \text{ dollars} = 221 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tommy raises a total of 221 dollars. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Shiela bought 5 cell phones, each costing $150. So, the total cost of the cell phones is:
   \[
   5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. There is a 2% interest on each cell phone. So, the interest on one cell phone is:
   \[
   150 \times 0.02 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total interest is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The total amount Shiela has to pay, including the interest, is:
   \[
   750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months. So, the amount she pays each month is:
   \[

Therefore, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) dollars each month for 3 months."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Artie has a flower stand and he sells different kinds of flowers. He rounds the prices to the nearest dollar because he doesn't have any change. Here are the prices he rounds to:
- Marigolds: $3.00 each
- Petunias: $2.00 each
- Begonias: $2.00 each

Now, let's see how much money he makes from each type of flower:
- He sells 12 pots of marigolds at $3.00 each. So, he makes \(12 \times 3 = 36\) dollars from marigolds.
- He sells 9 pots of petunias at $2.00 each. So, he makes \(9 \times 2 = 18\) dollars from petunias.
- He sells 17 pots of begonias at $2.00 each. So, he makes \(17 \times 2 = 34\) dollars from begonias.

Now, let's add up all the money he makes:
- \(36 + 18 + 34 = 88\) dollars

So, Artie makes 88 dollars. The correct answer is C."
"To find the average square footage of each level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to know the square footage of each level. We know the top level (level 4) has 16 square feet. Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

So, let's find the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: half of 16 is 8 square feet
- Level 2: half of 8 is 4 square feet
- Level 1: half of 4 is 2 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total square footage by 4 to find the average:
30 ÷ 4 = 7.5 square feet

The average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will give to the puppy in the first 180 days and then for the rest of the year.

First, we calculate the dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for 180 days.
- So, the total dog food for the first 180 days is \(1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}\).

Next, we calculate the dog food needed for the rest of the year:
- There are 365 days in a year, so the puppy will eat for \(365 - 180 = 185 \, \text{days}\).
- The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for these 185 days.
- So, the total dog food for the rest of the year is \(2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups}\).

Now, we add the dog food needed for both periods:
- Total dog food needed = \(180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups}\).

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will use, we divide the total dog food by the amount in one bag:
- Number of bags needed = \(550 \, \text{cups} \div 110 \, \text{cups/bag} = 5 \, \text{bags}\).

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. David does half of what Sarah does. So, we divide 400 by 4:
   \[
   400 \div 4 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half of what Sarah does. So, we divide 400 by 2:
   \[
   400 \div 2 = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
4. Now, to find out how much more laundry Raymond does than David, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does:
   \[
   200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Raymond does 100 pounds more laundry than David. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much money Vincent saves, we need to figure out the cost of buying 18 flowers in both ways and then see the difference.

First, let's look at buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages (because 18 divided by 3 is 6).
- So, the total cost is 6 packages times $2.50 per package, which is 6 times 2.50.
- 6 times 2.50 is 15.

Now, let's look at buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packages (because 18 divided by 2 is 9).
- So, the total cost is 9 packages times $1 per package, which is 9 times 1.
- 9 times 1 is 9.

Now, we need to find out how much more Vincent spends when buying in packages of 3 compared to buying in packages of 2:
- The cost when buying in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost when buying in packages of 2 is $9.
- The difference is $15 minus $9, which is 6.

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John goes to the groomer to get his new dog cleaned. The first cost is $100. But the groomer is giving a discount of 30% for new customers. 

To find out how much of the $100 is the discount, we calculate 30% of $100. 

30% of $100 is $100 * 0.30 = $30.

So, the discount is $30. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find out how much John has to pay.

$100 - $30 = $70.

So, the cost after the discount is $70.

The correct answer is C. $70."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 24 liters of water.
2. Two girls each get 1/6 of the 24 liters. So, each girl gets:

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the team played 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. Let's say they lost \( L \) games. So, they won \( L + 8 \) games.

The total number of games they played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Now, let's solve for \( L \):
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won:
\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games. The correct answer is:

"Gene goes on 4 vacations each year. He started vacationing when he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. To find out how many vacations he has been on, we subtract his starting age from his current age and then divide by the number of vacations he takes each year.

So, the number of vacations is:
\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \]
\[ 11 \div 4 = 2 \text{ years and } 3 \text{ vacations} \]

Since each vacation is one quilt block, and he has 3 vacations left after 2 full years, he has:

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. So we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to add up the potato salad for the adults and the children.

First, let's calculate how much potato salad the adults will eat:
- Each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

So, the total for the adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's calculate how much potato salad the children will eat:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

So, the total for the children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the total for the adults and the children to find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simple way.

1. Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Lee used to be able to run it 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald used to run it in 40 seconds.
3. Gerald's speed before the diet change was 400 meters in 40 seconds, so his speed was 10 meters per second.
4. After changing his diet, his speed improved by 10%. So, his new speed is 10 meters per second plus 10% of 10 meters per second.
5. 10% of 10 meters per second is 1 meter per second.
6. So, his new speed is 10 meters per second plus 1 meter per second, which is 11 meters per second.
7. To find out how fast Gerald can run now, we divide the distance by his new speed: 400 meters divided by 11 meters per second.
8. This gives us approximately 36.36 seconds.

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in about 36.36 seconds.

\[ \text{Number of cats} = 60 \times 2 = 120 \]

Now, we know the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats combined. First, let's find out how many dogs and cats there are together:

\[ \text{Total of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

Now, we subtract 12 from this total to find the number of rabbits:

\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:

\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348. The correct answer is:

C. 348"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 200 students in total. Out of these, 2/5 are boys. To find out how many boys there are, we do:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

So, there are 80 boys. This means the rest are girls:

\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Now, 2/3 of these girls are in the girl scout. To find out how many girls are in the girl scout, we do:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

So, 80 girls are in the girl scout. To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by noting that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, we calculate how many hours James slept:

\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The correct answer is:

C. 3"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. Freda's tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
2. When she cooks the tomatoes, they lose half their volume. So, before cooking, the tomatoes were twice the volume of the sauce. That means the tomatoes were 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.
3. Each can of tomatoes she uses is 16 ounces.
4. To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can: 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
5. Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
6. So, the total number of tomatoes she used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, the number of tomatoes Freda used is 12. The correct answer is C."
"Let's think about this step by step.

We start with 30 cars on the motorway. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through. Then, in the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through. After that, 5 cars take an exit.

So, we have:
- 30 cars initially
- Let's say \( x \) cars drive through in the first 15 minutes
- Then 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes
- 5 cars take an exit

The cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam are the ones that stayed on the motorway. So, the number of cars that stayed on the motorway is:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 \]

We know that the cars that stayed on the motorway are the ones that didn't drive through the traffic jam. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = \text{Cars that stayed on the motorway} \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 - x \]

Since the cars that stayed on the motorway are the ones that didn't drive through the traffic jam, and we know the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = \text{Total cars that drove through} \]

Given that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \), and the remaining cars are 5, we can write:
\[ 5 = 30 - (x + 20) \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 5 = 30 - x - 20 \]
\[ 5 = 10 - x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 - 5 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{A} \] (Assuming A is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if not provided, the answer is 5.)"
"Mary had 2 potted plants on each of her 40 window ledges. So, she had:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Then, she got 18 more plants from the nursery, so she had:

\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary is going to give 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, she will give away:

\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, to find out how many plants she will have left, we subtract the plants she gave away from the total plants she had:

\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"Let's add up the doorbell rings step by step, just like we did before, but in a simpler way.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, we calculate:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, we calculate:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]

Now, we add all these together:
\[
20 + 25 + 60 + 70
\]

Let's do the addition:
\[
20 + 25 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 60 = 105
\]
\[
105 + 70 = 175
\]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is 175.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}

"Solo needs to read a total of 39 pages. He has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, he has 4 more days to read the rest. 

To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we subtract the pages he has already read from the total pages and then divide by the number of days left.

39 pages (total) - 15 pages (read on Monday) = 24 pages left to read.

24 pages left ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day.

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days. The correct answer is:

\boxed{B} (if B represents 6 in a multiple-choice format)"
"Let's break it down step by step:

John drinks water with his meals every day. He has breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water a day.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends, he drinks only 1 glass of water with dinner:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, let's add the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

So, John drinks 22 glasses of water in a week. The correct answer is:

"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can break it down step by step.

1. The city is 42 miles across.
2. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.

First, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile. We do this by dividing the time it takes to cover 3 miles by 3:
\[ \text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 42 miles. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42:
\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Poppy starts with a 1000-piece puzzle. She puts a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is 250 pieces. So, after Poppy puts her pieces on the board, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, Poppy's mom puts a third of the remaining pieces on the board. A third of 750 is 250 pieces. So, after Poppy's mom puts her pieces on the board, there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 500. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Amir eats 5 cookies. Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. So, Cody eats \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cookies.

Now, to find out how many cookies they eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats. So, \(5 + 15 = 20\).

Therefore, both of them eat 20 cookies together.

The correct answer is C. 20."
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to know the inner size of one box. The outer size of each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick.

1. To find the inner length, we subtract 1 inch from each side of the length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches.
2. To find the inner width, we subtract 1 inch from each side of the width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches.
3. To find the inner height, we subtract 1 inch from each side of the height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches.

Now we know the inner size of one box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches. To find the volume of one box, we multiply these sizes together:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches. The correct answer is C."
"Let's think about it step by step. Frankie watched TV for a total of 7 hours. We know he watched 1 hour on Monday, 1 hour on Tuesday, and 1.5 hours on Thursday. That's 3.5 hours already. So, to make the total 7 hours, he must have watched the rest on Wednesday and Friday.

On Wednesday, he watched a 30-minute show, which is 0.5 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. So, the rest of the time he watched on Wednesday and Friday must add up to 7 - 3.5 = 3.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched 2 hours. So, the time he watched on Wednesday must be 3.5 - 2 = 1.5 hours. Since he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show on Thursday, the 1.5 hours he watched on Wednesday must be the 1-hour episode.

So, Frankie watched 1 hour on Wednesday, which is a 1-hour episode. He didn't watch any 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

The number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
- A) 0
- B) 1
- C) 2
- D) 3

The correct answer is:
- A) 0"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as last year. Let's say last year he baked \( x \) cookies.
2. This year, he baked \( 2x \) cookies plus 15 more cookies. So, he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
3. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies. So, he had \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left.
4. We know he has 110 cookies now. So, we can set up the equation: \( 2x + 10 = 110 \).
5. Now, let's solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
   Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 10 gallons of gas. The gas costs $3.00 per gallon, so we multiply 10 gallons by $3.00:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cashback. The cashback is $0.20 for every gallon, so we multiply 10 gallons by $0.20:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost of the gas:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, after the cashback, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas is $28.00. The correct answer is:

\boxed{28.00}"
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to know how many each of them ate.

Beatrice's fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Marcell's fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups they both ate:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question format, which is not provided in the original question but is included here for the sake of following the multiple-choice format requirement.)"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We need to find out how much water the boat takes on for every 10 feet she rows. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet.

First, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in 64 seconds. Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how many 10 feet are in 16 seconds and then multiply by 4 (because 64 seconds is 4 times 16 seconds).

In 16 seconds, Julia rows 20 feet, so in 10 seconds, she rows 10 feet. Therefore, in 64 seconds, she rows:
\[ 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in 80 feet:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 8 \text{ segments} \]

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for each 10-foot segment, the total amount of water taken on is:
\[ 8 \text{ segments} \times 2 \text{ liters/segment} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat took on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the correct option in a multiple-choice format, if provided.)"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. The problem says Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, we can find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing 1800 by 6.

\[ 1800 \div 6 = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

The problem also says that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. This means if Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, then the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is:

\[ 300 \div 50 = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Sasha has some leftover lumber she wants to sell. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each, and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each.

First, we calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards, and each costs $10.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(10 \times 10 = 100\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards, and each costs $16.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(5 \times 16 = 80\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of both types of boards to find the total cost:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Since Sasha is selling all the leftover lumber, she will get $180 from selling them. The question doesn't say how much she sells each board for, but we assume she sells them for the same price she bought them for, which is the same as the cost price.

So, if she sells all the lumber for $180, her profit is:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

The answer is that Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Katy uses sugar and water in a 7:13 ratio. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Together, these parts add up to 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

We know that the total parts used are 120. So, each part is equal to 120 ÷ 20 = 6.

Since the sugar part is 7, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7 × 6 = 42.

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

"John has 3 children, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child. So, he buys 2 times 3, which is 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60. To find out how much he paid, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair. So, 6 times 60 is 360. 

The answer is 360."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that initially, there were 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles initially was:
   \[
   2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

2. After more containers were brought in, the total number of vehicles became 30. So, the number of vehicles that were added on the second day is:
   \[
   30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

3. Since each container has 5 vehicles, we need to find out how many containers were needed to have 20 vehicles. We do this by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers}

"Okay, let's break it down simply.

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Four years later, his salary increased by 40%. So, we need to find out what 40% of $40,000 is and add that to $40,000.

First, calculate 40% of $40,000:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 40,000 = \frac{40}{100} \times 40,000 = 0.4 \times 40,000 = 16,000 \]

Now, add this to Adrien's initial salary:
\[ 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \]

So, Adrien's salary four years later is $56,000.

Lylah's salary four years ago was 30% less than Adrien's. So, we need to find out what 30% of $40,000 is and subtract that from $40,000.

First, calculate 30% of $40,000:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 40,000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 40,000 = 0.3 \times 40,000 = 12,000 \]

Now, subtract this from Adrien's initial salary:
\[ 40,000 - 12,000 = 28,000 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $28,000. Four years later, her salary increased by 40% as well.

First, calculate 40% of $28,000:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 28,000 = \frac{40}{100} \times 28,000 = 0.4 \times 28,000 = 11,200 \]

Now, add this to Lylah's initial salary:
\[ 28,000 + 11,200 = 39,200 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years later is $39,200.

Now, to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries:
\[ 56,000 + 39,200 = 95,200 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $95,200.

The correct answer is C. $95,200."

"Let's break it down day by day to find out how many hours Sadie slept in total.

1. On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. On Wednesday, she also slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
4. On Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than the total she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. The total for Tuesday and Wednesday is \(6 + 4 = 10\) hours. So, on Thursday and Friday, she slept \(10 + 1 = 11\) hours each day.

Now, let's add up all the hours:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Thursday: 11 hours
- Friday: 11 hours

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, Rosie runs for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how far she runs in these 3 hours, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Rosie runs 30 miles in the first 3 hours.

Next, we need to find out how much time she has left after running for 3 hours. She runs for a total of 7 hours, so:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, Rosie runs for these 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour. To find out how far she runs in these 4 hours, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Rosie runs 20 miles in the last 4 hours.

To find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours, we add the distances from both parts:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Jennie has a big pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She stamps one-third of these letters. So, she stamps 20 letters.

After stamping these 20 letters, there are 30 letters that already have stamps.

Before Jennie started stamping, there were some letters that already had stamps. We know that after she stamped 20 more, there were 30 in total.

So, if we take away the 20 letters she stamped, we get the number of letters that were already stamped before she started. That means:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Julia originally had some spoons, let's call this number \( x \).
2. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew.
4. After all this, she had 12 spoons left.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we need to subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. To find out how many sausages he bought in all, we add the chicken sausages and fish sausages together:

38 chicken sausages + 44 fish sausages = 82 sausages in total.

So, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is 82. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made \(50 + 20 = 70\) friends.

Now, to find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has. So, \(50 + 70 = 120\).

Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is 120.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that each pepper costs $15. Well's mother sells peppers, watermelons, and oranges. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so:

1. Cost of one watermelon = 3 times the cost of one pepper = 3 * $15 = $45.
2. An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs, so:
   Cost of one orange = Cost of one watermelon - $5 = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons,
- 20 peppers,
- 10 oranges.

Let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

1. Total cost for watermelons = 4 * $45 = $180.
2. Total cost for peppers = 20 * $15 = $300.
3. Total cost for oranges = 10 * $40 = $400.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total amount = $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours the hospital spends on seeing all the patients in a day. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, each patient is seen for 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, so the total hours spent on seeing patients is 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.

Next, we need to find out how much money the hospital gets from the patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients, so for 200 hours, the hospital gets 200 * 200 = $40,000.

Now, we need to find out how much the hospital spends on the doctors. The doctors charge $150 per hour, so for 200 hours, the hospital spends 200 * 150 = $30,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue. So, the profit is 40,000 - 30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

The correct answer is B."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit because of vomiting. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit because of vomiting.
3. Now, we subtract the 20 elves who quit from the original 60:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 elves are left.
4. Then, 10 more elves quit because kids kicked their shins.
5. We subtract the 10 elves who quit from the 40 elves left:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

So, the number of elves left is 30. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than in May. So, we need to subtract $60 from $500 to find out how much he spent in June.

$500 - $60 = $440

So, in June, Joseph spent $440.

Now, to find out how much he spent in total for May and June, we add the amounts together:

$500 (May) + $440 (June) = $940

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, for the roller coaster, Pam used:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Pam also rode the luge 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, for the luge, Pam used:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

So, in total, Pam used:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Now, let's look at Fred:
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, for the roller coaster, Fred used:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Fred also rode the luge 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, for the luge, Fred used:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

So, in total, Fred used:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ tickets} \]

Now, let's add up the tickets used by both Pam and Fred:
\[ 24 + 36 = 60 \text{ tickets} \]

So, the total number of tickets they used that day is 60. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles on Tuesday.
3. The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles.
4. The total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.
5. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday. So, \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can do the following:

1. First, we need to know how many car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes a month and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 4 by 12:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48
   \]
   So, Tom gets 48 car washes in a year.

2. Now, we know each car wash costs $15. To find out the total cost for 48 car washes, we multiply 48 by 15:
   \[
   48 \times 15 = 720
   \]
   So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{720}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. So, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands.

To find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we divide the total number of unicorns by 3:

\[
\frac{27}{3} = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Now, we know that two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. To find out how many female unicorns there are, we take two thirds of 9:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The correct answer is 6."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, we need to find out how much Rory spends on the subs, chips, and cookies. She orders 2 subs at $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each, and 2 cookies at $1.00 each.

The cost of the subs is:
\[ 2 \times 7.50 = 15.00 \]

The cost of the chips is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

The cost of the cookies is:
\[ 2 \times 1.00 = 2.00 \]

Now, we add these amounts together to find the subtotal:
\[ 15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00 \]

Next, we need to add a 20% delivery fee to the subtotal. To find 20% of $20.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00 \]

So, the total cost before the tip is:
\[ 20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00 \]

Now, we add a $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ 24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{29.00} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Mark took two tests. The first test had 75 questions and he had 8 hours to do it. He answered 5 questions in 1 hour, so in 8 hours, he answered \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions. That means he left \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions unanswered for the first test.

The second test had 100 questions and he had 6 hours to do it. He still answered 5 questions in 1 hour, so in 6 hours, he answered \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions. That means he left \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions unanswered for the second test.

To find out how many questions he left unanswered in total, we add the unanswered questions from both tests:
\[35 + 70 = 105\]

So, the number of questions Mark left unanswered is 105. The correct answer is:

**A. 105**"

"To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we first need to know how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - (\text{Number of automatic cars} + \text{Number of manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Now, to find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know there are 700 bees in total. The problem tells us there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. Let's use a simple way to find out how many there are of each type of bee.

1. Let's say there are \( Q \) queens.
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, there are \( 2Q \) baby bees.
3. And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \) worker bees.

Now, we know the total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queens. Now we can find out how many baby bees and worker bees there are:
- Baby bees: \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \)
- Worker bees: \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \)

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

"Let's break down the costs step by step and add the tax to the nonfood items.

First, we have the costs of the items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Now, let's add the tax to the light bulbs and roach traps. The tax rate is 10%.

- Tax on light bulbs: $3 × 10% = $0.30
- Tax on roach traps: $4 × 10% = $0.40

So, the new costs for the nonfood items are:
- Light bulbs: $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
- Roach traps: $4 + $0.40 = $4.40

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Light bulbs: $3.30
- Roach traps: $4.40

Total cost = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $15.70

So, the total cost including tax is $15.70.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kim has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so he will have 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.

First, we calculate the cost of the bleach:
- Each bottle of bleach costs $2.
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach.
- So, for 8 clients, the cost of bleach is \(8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the cloths:
- Each pack of cloths costs $5.
- Each client needs 1 pack of cloths.
- So, for 8 clients, the cost of cloths is \(8 \times 1 \times 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the bleach and the cloths to find the total expenses:
- Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20.

So, Kim's profit each week is $20. The correct answer is:

"John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. He can harvest pineapples every 3 months. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate how many times he can harvest in a year and then multiply that by the number of pineapples per hectare.

First, let's find out how many times John can harvest in a year. There are 12 months in a year, and he harvests every 3 months. So, we divide 12 by 3:
\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \]
John can harvest 4 times in a year.

Next, we know that he gets 100 pineapples from each hectare every time he harvests. Since he has 10 hectares, we multiply the number of harvests by the number of pineapples per hectare and then by the number of hectares:
\[ 4 \times 100 \times 10 = 4000 \]
So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{4000} \]"
"Johnny has three lego sets. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has a quarter of the number of pieces as the first set, so it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

To find out how many pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:
\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 pieces of legos. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, she saw half that many bees return in the next 6 hours. So, the number of bees that returned is:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ bees} \]

After the first 12 hours, 30 bees left and 15 bees returned, so the net change is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ bees left} \]

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the 30 that left in the first 6 hours came out. So, the number of bees that came out is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees} \]

Now, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours returned. So, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ bees} \]

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"Steve and Tim are racing home from school. Steve lives 3 miles away and can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away and can skate at 264 feet per minute. We need to find out how long it will take each of them to get home and then see how long Steve will wait for Tim.

First, let's convert the distances to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes, and the loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes. So, Steve will wait for Tim for:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Shawnda wants to charge 25 cents for each tire she inflates. She had different people come by with different types of bikes and a unicycle. Here's how many tires she had to inflate:

- 5 people came with bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 bicycles × 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 tricycles × 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- 1 person came with a unicycle. A unicycle has 1 tire.

Now, let's add up all the tires:
10 tires from bicycles + 9 tires from tricycles + 1 tire from the unicycle = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so:
20 tires × 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

To change 500 cents into dollars, we know that 100 cents make 1 dollar. So:
500 cents ÷ 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day. The correct answer is:
\boxed{D} (assuming D is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question format)."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies. Each pack has 6 cookies. So, he gets:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie costs $0.10. So, the total cost for all the cookies is:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times $0.10 \text{ per cookie} = $6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he gets, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill:

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate \(14 \div 2 = 7\) fries.
3. After the seagull, the number of fries left is \(14 + 7 = 21\).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries.
5. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \(21 + 9 = 30\).
6. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20\) fries.
7. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \(30 - 20 = 10\).
8. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 9 fries.
9. We know that 9 fries were left, and this is the final number of fries before the raccoon ate.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Kimo has 3 classes each on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Each class is 1 hour long.
2. So, on these days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each day.
3. There are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), so in one week, he spends \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
4. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so in one semester, he spends \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours on these days.

Now, let's look at Tuesdays and Thursdays:
1. On these days, he has 2 classes each, and each class is 2 hours long.
2. So, on these days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each day.
3. There are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), so in one week, he spends \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
4. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so in one semester, he spends \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours on these days.

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days:
1. Total hours in one semester = hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday + hours on Tuesday and Thursday
2. Total hours = \(144 + 128 = 272\)

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 272 hours. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Bill bakes different things every day:
- 300 rolls
- 120 chocolate croissants
- 60 baguettes

Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. We need to find out how long all these baked goods are when put end to end in feet.

First, let's find out how long all the baked goods are in inches:
- Rolls: \(300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}\)
- Croissants: \(120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}\)
- Baguettes: \(60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}\)

Now, let's add these lengths together:
- Total length in inches = \(1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}\)

Next, we need to convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
- Total length in feet = \(3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}\)

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.

The correct answer is:

"The zookeeper needs to feed the apes for 2 months. Let's break it down month by month.

First, let's look at the monkeys:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas every month.
- For 2 months, the monkeys need \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

Next, let's look at the gorillas:
- Gorillas need 400 bananas every month.
- For 2 months, the gorillas need \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

Now, let's look at the baboons:
- Baboons need 100 bananas every month.
- For 2 months, the baboons need \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, let's add up all the bananas needed for 2 months:
- Monkeys: 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 800 bananas
- Baboons: 200 bananas

Total bananas needed = 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each time he runs 100 yards out and 100 yards back, so that's 200 yards per round trip. If he does this 15 times, we calculate:
   \[
   15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards}
   \]
   So, Blake runs 3000 yards.

2. Now, let's find out how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back. That's 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so we calculate:
   \[
   34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards}
   \]
   So, Kelly runs 2720 yards.

3. To find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
   \[
   3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards}
   \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Raphael bought:
- 4 pens at $1.5 each.
- 2 notebooks at $4 each.
- A rim of bond paper for $20.

First, we calculate the cost of the pens:
\[ 4 \text{ pens} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pen} = 4 \times 1.5 = \$6 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
\[ 2 \text{ notebooks} \times \$4 \text{ per notebook} = 2 \times 4 = \$8 \]

Now, we add the cost of the bond paper:
\[ \$20 \]

To find the total amount Raphael spent, we add all these costs together:
\[ \$6 + \$8 + \$20 = \$34 \]

So, Raphael spent a total of \$34. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding, so now he can see 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so he can see 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles now.

The final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 15.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water.

On Tuesday, it has 7 feet more than Monday. So, we add 7 feet to 17 feet:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The correct answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

- Starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Total fish caught:
- Starfish: 15
- Sea horses: 9
- Clownfish: 8

Adding these together:
\[ 15 + 9 + 8 = 32 \]

So, the total number of fish they caught is 32.

The correct answer is:

"To find out how much a bag of marbles costs after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step.

1. The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months. So, every two months, the price becomes 120% of the previous price.
3. We need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months. That's 36 divided by 2, which is 18 periods.
4. For each period, the price is multiplied by 1.20 (which is the same as adding 20% to the price).
5. So, after 18 periods, the price will be $20 multiplied by 1.20 raised to the power of 18.

Let's calculate it:
- After the first two months, the price is $20 * 1.20 = $24.
- After the next two months, the price is $24 * 1.20 = $28.80.
- This continues, and after 18 periods, the price will be $20 * (1.20)^18.

Now, let's calculate (1.20)^18:
- (1.20)^2 = 1.44
- (1.20)^4 = 1.44 * 1.44 = 2.0736
- (1.20)^8 = 2.0736 * 2.0736 = 4.29981696
- (1.20)^16 = 4.29981696 * 4.29981696 = 18.53020153
- (1.20)^18 = 18.53020153 * 1.20 = 22.23624184

Now, multiply this by the original price:
- $20 * 22.23624184 = $444.7248368

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price after 36 months is $445.

So, the correct answer is:
\boxed{D} (Assuming D is the option for $445)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have:
- 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
- 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
- 1 doll, and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's find out how much 3 action figures cost:
- Each action figure costs $5.
- So, 3 action figures cost \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the doll also costs $15.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The cost of 3 action figures is $15.
- The cost of the doll is $15.

So, the total cost is \(20 + 15 + 15 = 50\) dollars.

The total value of all the toys is:

"To figure out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the missed income from doing her own taxes to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses $35 for every hour she does her own taxes. If she does her own taxes, she loses 3 hours of work. So, the total missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. The correct answer is:

"Elvira has a budget of €1500. She spent money on different computer accessories. Let's add up the cost of these accessories:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:

€157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €509 = €991

So, Elvira will have €991 left for her clothing. The correct answer is:

B. €991"
"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we can do the following:

1. Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits.
2. To make one flan, she needs 3 eggs.
3. To make 15 flans, she needs \(15 \times 3 = 45\) eggs.
4. Since she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times 9 goes into 45. 

So, we divide 45 by 9:
\[ 45 \div 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 flans.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is \( B \) years old, Seth is \( 2B \) years old.

In 2 years, Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old and Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old. The problem says the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to add up the miles he walks on weekdays and the miles he walks on weekends.

First, let's calculate the miles he walks on weekdays:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- On each weekday, he walks 20 miles.
- So, the total miles he walks on weekdays is \(5 \times 20 = 100\) miles.

Next, let's calculate the miles he walks on weekends:
- There are 2 days in the weekend.
- On each weekend day, he walks 10 miles.
- So, the total miles he walks on weekends is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) miles.

Now, we add the miles from weekdays and weekends together:
- Total miles = miles on weekdays + miles on weekends
- Total miles = 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much each uniform costs, we need to add up the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants.

First, we know the hat costs $25.

Next, the jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
So, the jacket costs $75.

Now, the pants cost the average of the hat and jacket costs. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket and then divide by 2:
\[ \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]
So, the pants cost $50.

To find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, each uniform costs $150 in total. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]"
"To find out the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to add up the legs from the spiders, insects, and the rare mutant invertebrates.

First, let's calculate the legs from the spiders:
- Jake sees 80 spiders.
- Each spider has 8 legs.
- So, the total legs from spiders are \(80 \times 8 = 640\) legs.

Next, let's calculate the legs from the insects:
- Jake sees 90 insects.
- Each insect has 6 legs.
- So, the total legs from insects are \(90 \times 6 = 540\) legs.

Now, let's calculate the legs from the rare mutant invertebrates:
- Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
- Each rare mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.
- So, the total legs from rare mutant invertebrates are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Legs from spiders: 640
- Legs from insects: 540
- Legs from rare mutant invertebrates: 30

Total legs = \(640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\)

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.
5. The Caboose is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so the Caboose is 8 years old.

"Jessica has three debts. She wants to pay more than the minimum amount, but not too much. First, we need to find out how much she pays each month if she pays 50% more than the minimum.

The minimum payments are:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

So, the total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we calculate 50% of $1000:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, she pays:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, to find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the amount Jessica pays in a year is $18000.

"Billy needs to peel and cut each potato. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel one potato and 5 seconds to cut one potato. First, let's find out how long it takes to do both for one potato.

- Peeling one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Cutting one potato: 5 seconds

To add these times, we need to convert 1.5 minutes to seconds:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Billy has 60 potatoes to do this for. So, we multiply the time for one potato by the number of potatoes:
\[ 95 \text{ seconds per potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, convert 5700 seconds to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question format.)"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much they sold in total to make a profit of $25. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, for each gallon, they make:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

They made a profit of $25, and we know that profit is the total money they made minus the money they spent. They spent money on lemons and sugar. Let's say they spent \( x \) dollars on lemons and \( y \) dollars on sugar. So, the total cost is:

\[ x + y \]

The total money they made is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times \$10/\text{gallon} = \$50 \]

Since their profit is $25, we can write:

\[ \$50 - (x + y) = \$25 \]

This means:

\[ x + y = \$50 - \$25 = \$25 \]

We know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, so for 5 gallons, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times \$5/\text{gallon} = \$25 \]

So, they spent $25 on lemons and sugar combined. Since the question asks specifically how much they spent on lemons, and we know the total cost is $25, the amount spent on lemons is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]

The correct answer is D."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a total of 240 people in the race. Out of these, 80 are Japanese. So, the rest are Chinese. To find out how many Chinese people there are, we subtract the number of Japanese people from the total number of people:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

So, there are 160 Chinese people in the race. We know that 60 of these Chinese people are boys. To find out how many are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, there are 100 girls on the Chinese team. The correct answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Zaid's salary is $6000.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. So, the rent is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
   \]
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. So, the car fuel is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
   \]
4. After paying rent and car fuel, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500
   \]
5. He donates half of the remaining amount to charity. So, the donation is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
   \]
6. After the donation, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   2500 - 1250 = 1250
   \]
7. He gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife. So, the total given to his daughter and wife is:
   \[
   200 + 700 = 900
   \]
8. The remaining amount after giving to his daughter and wife is:
   \[
   1250 - 900 = 350

"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to add up the money he made each week.

First, let's calculate how much he earned in the first week:
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- He earns $10 for each hour.

So, for the first week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

Next, let's calculate how much he earned in the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 for each hour.

So, for the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

"To find out how many votes the loser got, we first need to know how many votes the winner got. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes, and the total number of votes is 80.

So, we calculate the winner's votes:
\[ \text{Winner's votes} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

This means the winner got 60 votes. Since there are 80 votes in total, the loser must have gotten the rest of the votes:
\[ \text{Loser's votes} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

So, the loser got 20 votes. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Sandra ordered some flowers, and we need to find out how many red roses she ordered. Here's what we know:

1. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies.
2. The number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations she ordered.
3. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.

First, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write it as:
\[ 5 \times \text{number of white carnations} = 200 \]

To find the number of white carnations, we divide 200 by 5:
\[ \text{number of white carnations} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find out how many red roses she ordered. Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, we can write it as:
\[ \text{number of red roses} = 4 \times \text{number of white carnations} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Sandra needs 160 red roses to be delivered by 5 pm. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's solve this step by step as if I'm a person with primary school level education.

We know Jan is 30 years old now.

1. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years younger than half of Jan's age. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14.
3. Therefore, Mark was 14 - 5 = 9 years old two years ago.
4. So, Mark's current age is 9 + 2 = 11 years old.
5. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 11 + 2 = 13 years old.

The correct answer is 13."
"To find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, we need to calculate the total time for each team to finish the race.

First, let's calculate the total time for Team 1:
- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 members in the team.

So, the total time for Team 1 is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for Team 2:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

So, the total time for Team 2 is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds Team 1 wins by, we subtract the total time for Team 1 from the total time for Team 2:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Team 1 wins by 2 seconds. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if not provided, the correct answer is 2 seconds.)"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To find how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then convert to a percentage:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The correct answer is:
\[

"Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many as her mom, so Jenna picked:

\[ 20 \div 2 = 10 \text{ apples} \]

Together, they picked:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they both picked is 30. The correct answer is C."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know there are 160 pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the hamsters get \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces of straw.
3. There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.
4. The rest of the straw is given to the rats. So, the rats get \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces of straw.
5. The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is \(90 \div 6 = 15\).
6. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest and add it to the original amount.

1. Mandy owes Benedict $100.
2. The interest rate is 2% per month.
3. Mandy pays after 3 months.

First, let's find out how much the interest is for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Now, let's find out the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

To find the total amount Mandy should give, we add the interest to the original amount:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

The correct answer is **C**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The trader buys wheat at $20 per bag and spends $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost for one bag is $20 + $2 = $22. The trader sells each bag for $30 and made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags.

First, we need to find out how much the trader spends on all the bags. If the trader spends $22 on one bag, then for 50 bags, the total cost would be $22 * 50 = $1100.

Next, we know the trader's total profit is $400. Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. So, if the profit is $400, the total revenue must be the profit plus the total cost. That means the total revenue is $400 + $1100 = $1500.

Since the trader sells each bag for $30, we can find out how many bags he sold by dividing the total revenue by the price per bag. So, $1500 / $30 = 50 bags.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags. The correct answer is:

**B**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much they spent in total. They bought 3 tickets to the fair, and each ticket cost $20.25. So, the total cost for the tickets is:
\[ 3 \times 20.25 = 60.75 \]

Next, they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost of the food is:
\[ 60.75 - 4.50 = 56.25 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ 60.75 + 56.25 = 117 \]

They also went on 2 different rides, and each ride cost $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the tickets and food to the total cost of the rides to find the overall total cost:
\[ 117 + 66 = 183 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{183}{3} = 61 \]

So, each of them paid $61.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{61} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he collects peaches for 3 times 60 minutes, which is 180 minutes. He can collect 2 peaches in one minute. So, to find out how many peaches he collects in 180 minutes, we multiply 180 by 2.

\[ 180 \times 2 = 360 \]

So, John collects 360 peaches. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we first need to know how much each duck eats in a day. We know that each duck eats 3.5 pounds of insects in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 3.5 pounds by 7 to find out how much each duck eats in one day.

\[ \text{Insects per day for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we have 10 ducks, so we multiply the amount each duck eats in a day by 10 to find out how much all the ducks eat in a day.

\[ \text{Insects per day for 10 ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the ducks need 5 pounds of insects per day. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
3. After 10 years, the number of trees he would have is \(50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, \(30\%\) of 130 trees die, which is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
5. Therefore, the number of trees left after the deaths is \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom has \(\boxed{91}\) trees left."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. On Friday, Sue has 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday, the neighbors take back one third of the flamingos and paint them white. One third of 18 is 6, so 6 flamingos are taken back and painted white.
3. After taking back 6 flamingos, Sue has \(18 - 6 = 12\) pink flamingos left.
4. On Sunday, the neighbors add 18 more pink flamingos to the yard. So, Sue now has \(12 + 18 = 30\) pink flamingos.
5. The neighbors also paint 6 of the pink flamingos white.
6. Now, Sue has 6 white flamingos.
7. To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: \(30 - 6 = 24\).

So, there are 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

"Violetta wants to buy crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. She has $20. To find out how much change she will get, we need to know the total cost of the crayons and then subtract that from the $20 she has.

First, we calculate the total cost of the crayons:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $20 she has:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Violetta will get $10 in change. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, if we add these two costs together, we get:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means a pen costs $1.50. Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We do this by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

The correct answer is:

**B. 12.00**"

We have 200 pounds of carrots and 40 restaurants. Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots. 

First, we need to find out how many pounds of carrots all the restaurants will get together. We do this by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount of carrots each restaurant gets:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of carrots given to the restaurants from the total amount of carrots we started with:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, we subtract this sum from the total population to find the number of children:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

So, there are 6277 children in Soda. The correct answer is C."
"Let's break it down step by step to find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now.

1. Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times the number she started with. So, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. So, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The total from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\) cards. So, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's add all the cards together:
- Initial cards: 20
- Cards from the first month: 60
- Cards from the second month: 40
- Cards from the third month: 200

Total cards = \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\)

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents for each sentence. So, for Publisher A, he earns:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents for each sentence. For Publisher B, he earns:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the earnings from both publishers to find out how much Mark makes in a week:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

So, Mark makes 15000 cents in a week. The correct answer is:

- In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails.

So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is:
\[ 5 \text{ pails} + 6 \text{ pails} = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Now, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. So, to find out the total liters of water, we multiply the total number of pails by the liters each pail contains:
\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

John got a special prize at work. This prize has two parts:
1. A one-time money prize of $5000.
2. A raise in his salary. His salary was $2000 a week, and the raise is 5%. So, his new salary is $2000 plus 5% of $2000.

First, let's find out how much the raise is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 2000 = 0.05 \times 2000 = 100 \]

So, his new salary is:
\[ 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Now, John gets this new salary every week for the whole year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Now, we add the $5000 prize to the total money he made from his new salary:
\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total money John made that year is $114200.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - So, for sandwiches, he used \(5 \times 2 = 10\) slices of cheese.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich.
   - Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.
   - So, for omelets, he used \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices of cheese.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week.
   - He used 8 slices of cheese in the big dish.
   - So, for macaroni and cheese, he used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the cheese slices:
- Sandwiches: 10 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Total cheese slices used: \(10 + 9 + 8 = 27\)

So, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is 27. The correct answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

First, we calculate how many kilometers Micheal rode in the first four weeks:
- He rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

Next, we calculate how many kilometers he rode in the next three weeks:
- He decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods:
- First four weeks: 500 kilometers
- Next three weeks: 360 kilometers
- Total: \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers

So, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 860 kilometers. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much Joe's bag of candy weighs, we need to add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples.

First, we know each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar. Since a chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, a candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Jerry has chickens that lay eggs. Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. He has two more white chickens than red chickens.

First, let's say Jerry has \( r \) red chickens. Then he has \( r + 2 \) white chickens because he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Each red chicken lays 3 eggs a day, so \( r \) red chickens will lay \( 3r \) eggs a day.
Each white chicken lays 5 eggs a day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens will lay \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs a day.

The total number of eggs collected every day is the sum of the eggs laid by the red and white chickens:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Now, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers.

So, we do 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, on the third day, Sloane counted 250 customers.

The correct answer is C. 250."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have two pools, and we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool had \( S \) gallons of water 4 minutes ago. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 2S \) gallons of water.

Now, since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool loses \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.

So, the small pool now has \( S - 16 \) gallons of water.
And the big pool now has \( 2S - 16 \) gallons of water.

We also know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ 64 - 16 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 48 = 2S \]
\[ S = 24 \]

So, the small pool now has 24 gallons of water.

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back $2000 plus 10% more. So, 10% of $2000 is $200. Adding this to the $2000, she promised to pay back $2200.

Now, she pays $165 every month for 12 months. So, the total she will pay in 12 months is $165 times 12, which is $1980.

To find out how much she still owes, we subtract the total she will pay from the amount she promised to pay back. So, $2200 minus $1980 is $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is $220. The correct answer is C."

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Harriet is 21 years old now. If we add 3 years to her age, we get:
\[ 21 + 3 = 24 \]
So, in three years, Harriet will be 24 years old.

We also know that Zack is twice as old as Harriet. So, if Harriet is 21, then Zack is:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \]
If we add 3 years to Zack's age, we get:

If we add 3 years to Adrian's age, we get:
\[ 63 + 3 = 66 \]
So, in three years, Adrian will be 66 years old.

Now, to find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages together and then divide by 3:
\[ \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

So, the average age of the three in three years will be 45.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question, which is not provided in the original question but is included here for the sake of the multiple-choice format.)"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. So, we calculate half of 68 and then add 10:
   \[
   \text{Half of 68} = \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 more than what Naomi scored:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

So, Jojo scored 54 points. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\] (Assuming D is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if not provided, the answer is 54 points.)"
"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time she spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden, so the tank has:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Then, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank now is:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters. The correct answer is:

**90 liters**"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. To find out how many flowers he plants in total, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together: 90 + 50 = 140. So, Andy plants 140 flowers in total. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

In the first year, the company spent $15000 on advertising. In the second year, they spent a third of that amount, which is $15000 / 3 = $5000.

So, the total amount spent over the two years is $15000 + $5000 = $20000.

The correct answer is C. $20000."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour. He uses it for 3 hours. So, the cost for Carlos is:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. He uses it for 5 hours. So, the cost for Benji is:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they pay:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is 180 dollars. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. 

Now, to go back from Rochester to New Jersey, he takes half as many days as the trip to Rochester. So, he takes \(6 \div 2 = 3\) days to go back by car.

To find out the total number of days he travels, we add the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip:
- Days to Rochester: 6 days
- Days back by car: 3 days

So, the total days he travels is \(6 + 3 = 9\) days.

The correct answer is 9 days."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

James starts with:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards, so he has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

He buys 14 more grass type cards, so he now has:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \text{ grass type cards} \]

Now, the total number of cards he has is:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ total cards} \]

To find the percentage of water type cards, we use:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is:
\[ 33\% \]

The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33%.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The base burrito costs $6.50.
2. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00.
3. He also adds extra cheese for $1.00.
4. He puts avocado for $1.00.
5. He gets 2 sauces, each costing $0.25, so that's $0.25 * 2 = $0.50.
6. He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

So, Chad still owes $9.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{D} \]"
"To find out how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to figure out how many pieces they can put together in one minute and then see how many minutes it will take to finish 360 pieces.

Kalinda can put 4 pieces in one minute, and her mom can put half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is 2 pieces in one minute. So together, they can put:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to put 360 pieces together. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can put together in one minute:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour. So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{A} \] (Assuming A is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if provided.)"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The farm made 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate 30% of 120:
   \[
   0.30 \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest.
3. After Ashlyn took the ready ones home, the number of watermelons left is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate 3/4 of 84:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.
5. The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, the total cost for the cars is:
\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, Mark has to pay 10% tax on these cars. To find out how much the tax is, we calculate 10% of $240,000:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 240,000 = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration:
\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

After that, Mark has to pay $1000 for registration on each car. Since he has 12 cars, the total registration cost is:
\[ 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost before registration to find out the final amount Mark pays:
\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays is $276,000. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collected:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells} \]

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. So, we need to multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:
\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \text{ shells} \]

Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday. The correct answer is:

"Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, then the number of bugs is half of 50, which is 25. So, the total number of insects in the garden is the number of ants plus the number of bugs, which is 50 ants plus 25 bugs. That makes a total of 75 insects.

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We start with 36 penguins.
2. One-third of them jump into the ocean. To find out how many that is, we do:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.
3. Another one-third go into the cave. Again, we do:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go into the cave.
4. Now, we add the penguins that went into the ocean and the cave:
   \[
   12 + 12 = 24
   \]
   So, 24 penguins are not sunbathing.
5. To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we subtract the number that went into the ocean and the cave from the total number:
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12
   \]

So, the number of penguins still sunbathing is 12.

The correct answer is:
\boxed{12}"
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day. His girlfriend eats half as much, so she eats 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day. That means they eat 9 tomatoes * 7 days = 63 tomatoes a week. If one vine produces 3 tomatoes a week, then Steve needs 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes per vine = 21 vines. So, the number of vines Steve needs is 21. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many slices of pizza John needs in total. John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. So, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend gets:
   \[
   20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. Next, we need to know how many slices are in each pizza. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

3. Now, we need to find out how many pizzas are needed to get 80 slices. We do this by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
   \[
   80 \text{ slices} \div 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 10 \text{ pizzas}

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start with the information given:

- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is 5 years older than Jessa.
- Mary is 2 years younger than Joan.

First, let's find Joan's age:
- Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Next, let's find Mary's age:
- Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we add the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa to find the sum:
- Sum of the ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 + 25 + 23.

Let's add these numbers:
- 20 + 25 = 45
- 45 + 23 = 68.

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68. The correct answer is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step as if you are a person with primary school level education.

1. We start with 1000 students in the hall.
2. 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find out how many students that is, we calculate 30% of 1000:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.
3. Now, we need to find out how many students are left after 300 students went out through exit A:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students are left.
4. Next, we need to find out how many of these 700 students went out through exit B. We know that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3 \times 700}{5} = \frac{2100}{5} = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.
5. Now, we need to find out how many students are left after 420 students went out through exit B:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]
   So, 280 students are left.
6. The rest of the students went out through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The number of students who went out through exit C is \boxed{280}."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know John has 54 candies. John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, to find out how many candies Robert has, we divide John's candies by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James's candies from John's candies:

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The correct answer is:

3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's see how many books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own books: 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's book: 1 book.
- So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's see how many books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own book: 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's books: 2 books.
- So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora:
- Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads 3 books.
- Together, they read \(3 + 3 = 6\) books.

"Mike used to have 5 pen pals. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he has 3 pen pals left. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. So, to find out how many pages he writes in a week, we do:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we need to convert minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week. The correct answer is:

C"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to add up all the minutes he has used and then subtract that from his total plan allowance.

First, we calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss. Since he calls his boss for 15 minutes every day and there are 30 days in the month, he uses:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he used for calls to other people, which is 300 minutes. So, the total number of minutes used is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. Therefore, the number of minutes he has left is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We have two aquariums. In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails. In the second aquarium, there are 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

The problem says that this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( F \), then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference in snails is twice the total number of fish, so we can write:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, we need to find out what \( F \) is. To do this, we divide 28 by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours the makeup artist works in total. She works 6 hours each day and needs it done 4 times a week. So, in one week, she works:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie lasts 5 weeks, so the total hours she works over the 5 weeks is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to know how much she charges for these hours. She charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, she gives a 10% discount. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $30,000:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 30000 = 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, that's 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed \( c \) cougars today. Then he killed \( 3c \) wolves.

He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. The previous night he killed 15 cougars, so today he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

So, if he killed 12 cougars today, he must have killed \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

So, the total number of animals he killed is 25 + 48 = 73 animals.

The correct answer is 73."
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He goes up to a floor that's 4 times the number of the floor he starts on plus 6. So, we calculate \(4 \times 3 = 12\), and then add 6 to that, which gives us \(12 + 6 = 18\). Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{18} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply.

Mitchell went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchell. So, we need to find out how many times that is.

30% of 30 is 9 because 30 times 0.30 equals 9. So, we subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide.

30 - 9 = 21

So, Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply 21 by 4.

21 times 4 equals 84.

So, Robert went down the slide 84 times.

The correct answer is 84."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. The total number of cows now is:
\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 40 new cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:
\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 16. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Brady has different types of money in his piggy bank:
- 100 pennies
- 40 nickels
- 20 dimes
- 40 dollar bills

First, we need to find out how much each type of money is worth.

1. **Pennies:**
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - So, 100 pennies are worth \(100 \times 0.01 = 1.00\) dollar.

2. **Nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - So, 40 nickels are worth \(40 \times 0.05 = 2.00\) dollar.

3. **Dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - So, 20 dimes are worth \(20 \times 0.10 = 2.00\) dollar.

4. **Dollar Bills:**
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - So, 40 dollar bills are worth \(40 \times 1.00 = 40.00\) dollar.

Now, we add up all these amounts:
- Pennies: $1.00
- Nickels: $2.00
- Dimes: $2.00
- Dollar Bills: $40.00

Adding these together:
\[ 1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00 \]

So, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank.

The correct answer is **D**."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know the redwood tree is 200 feet tall. Each 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds. So, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in 200 feet.

\[ \text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree before any damage is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, so 70% of the tree remains. To find out how much the tree weighs after the termites ate, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:

\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the redwood tree weighs 5600 pounds after the termites ate.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"
"Nancy has 8 books overdue. Each book costs $0.50, and she also has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book overdue.

First, we calculate the cost for the books:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Then, we add the flat fee:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Andrea has 52 apples. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so if Jamal has \( J_a \) apples, he has \( J_a + 4 \) bananas.

Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_a \) apples, Andrea has \( J_a + 8 \) apples. We know Andrea has 52 apples, so:
\[ J_a + 8 = 52 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

So, Jamal has 44 apples. Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, he has:
\[ J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, we know Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas (since she has half as many bananas as Jamal, who has 48 bananas):
\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Apples} + \text{Bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 76 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 76. The correct answer is:

\boxed{76}"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to know how many cookies she's making in total. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make 12 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a simple ratio:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply and then divide:

\[
2 \times 66 = 12 \times x
\]

\[
132 = 12x
\]

\[
x = \frac{132}{12} = 11
\]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"To find out how much money is in the stack, we first need to know how many pennies are in the stack. The stack has two thirds of the pennies in the cup. The cup has 9,300 pennies.

First, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

Now, we know there are 6200 pennies in the stack. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we can find out how many dollars are in 6200 pennies by dividing 6200 by 100:

\[
\text{Total dollars} = \frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

So, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees Chris has. So, we divide Chris's trees by 2:

\[ 6 \div 2 = 3 \]

Ferdinand has 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has. First, we find out twice the number of Ferdinand's trees:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Then we add 5 to that number:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

So, the answer is 8."

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]
Samantha has $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]
Daisy has $175.

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their money together:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mrs. Cruz wants to buy a house that doesn't cost more than $400,000. She found a house that costs $350,000. But there are some extra costs she has to pay:

1. A 5% brokerage fee on the house price.
2. A 12% transfer fee on the house price.

First, let's find out how much the brokerage fee is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

Next, let's find out how much the transfer fee is:
\[ 12\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the house price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price:
\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. So, we need to find out how much more the total price is than her budget:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The correct answer is:

B. $9,500"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some money for the house transfer and for the people who helped sell the house. Then, he also had to pay $250,000 to finish paying for the house.

First, let's find out how much he paid for the transfer and the help. He paid 3% of $400,000 for the transfer and 5% of $400,000 for the help. 

3% of $400,000 is:
\[ 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

5% of $400,000 is:
\[ 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

So, the total money he paid for the transfer and the help is:
\[ 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Now, if we subtract the money he paid for the transfer and the help from the selling price, we get:
\[ 400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000 \]

But he also had to pay $250,000 to finish paying for the house. So, we subtract that from the $368,000:
\[ 368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{118000} \]"
"To find out how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to add up the time it takes for each part of the process.

First, it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.
Then, it takes 40% longer to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]
So, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]
After that, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]
Now, we add up all the times:
\[ 20 \text{ (heating to 300 degrees)} + 28 \text{ (heating to 400 degrees)} + 23 \text{ (cooking)} = 71 \text{ minutes} \]
So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes.

The correct answer is:

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent in total, we need to add up the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The cost of one newspaper ad is $5.
- The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

So, the total cost for newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The cost of one television ad is $75.
- The real estate agent bought 15 television ads.

So, the total cost for television ads is:
\[ 75 \times 15 = 1125 \]

Now, we add the total cost of newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent:
\[ 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads.

The correct answer is C. $1375."

2. Half of these balls are golf balls. So, we divide 16 by 2:
   \[
   \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 golf balls.
3. Now, half of these golf balls are blue. So, we divide 8 by 2:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]
   So, there are 4 blue golf balls.

The number of blue golf balls is 4.

The correct answer is B."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Mary has 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add up all the M&Ms:
300 (from the first bag) + 312 (from the second bag) + 150 (from the third bag) = 762 M&Ms.

So, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John has 2 houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows. So, in one house, the number of windows in the bedrooms is:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
\[ 6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Each house also has 4 windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. So, for 2 houses, the total number of these windows is:
\[ 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows:
\[ 12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much change the mother gets back, we first need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20.
The cost of the laundry is $9.45.
The cost of the package of pasta is $1.35.

We add these amounts together:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00.

\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

First, we know the total stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. We also know:
- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so that's 900 divided by 10, which is 90 stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 90 times 2, which is 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches
- Total for collar and rosette: 90 + 180 = 270 stitches

Next, we subtract the stitches for the collar and the rosette from the total stitches to find out how many stitches are left for the sleeves:
- Total stitches for the whole sweater: 1800
- Stitches for collar and rosette: 270
- Stitches for the sleeves: 1800 - 270 = 1530

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes:
- Stitches per sleeve: 1530 divided by 2 = 765 stitches

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have a solo song with 54 lines. Sean has to memorize all 54 lines from the song.

Next, the first scene has twice as many lines as the song. So, the first scene has:
\[ 2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines} \]

Only a third of these lines are Sean's. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines} \]

Now, the second scene has 6 more lines than the song. So, the second scene has:
\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines} \]

Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines} \]

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 \text{ (song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138 \text{ lines} \]

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total. The correct answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

Carly started with 80 cards. First, we find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2 out of every 5 cards had A, we calculate:

\(\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32\)

So, 32 cards had A. This leaves us with:

\(80 - 32 = 48\)

Next, we need to find out how many of these 48 cards had the letter B on them. Since half of the remaining cards had B, we calculate:

\(\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24\)

This leaves us with:

\(48 - 24 = 24\)

Now, we need to find out how many of these 24 cards had the letter C on them. Since 5 out of every 8 cards had C, we calculate:

\(\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15\)

This leaves us with:

\(24 - 15 = 9\)

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

So, the time for small holes is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

So, the time for large holes is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for both types of holes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. The correct answer is:

"Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 20 years. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. So, we add 10 years to each of their current ages and then add those extra years together.

So, if we add 10 years to their current ages, their ages will be:
- Mico: \( M + 10 \)
- Marco: \( R + 10 \)

The total sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 20 \]

We know that \( M + R = 20 \), so:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. So if Sam is \( S \) years old, Ruby is \( 6S \) years old.

In 9 years, Sam will be \( S + 9 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 6S + 9 \) years old. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We have:
- Each cobra has 70 spots.
- Each mamba has half the spots of a cobra, so each mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.
- There are 40 cobras, so the total spots for all cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.
- There are 60 mambas, so the total spots for all mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.
- The total spots for all cobras and mambas combined is 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.
- Half of 4900 is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

So, the final answer is 2450 spots.

   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length left for the sterling silver beads is:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 0.25:
   \[
   17 \div 0.25 = 68
   \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first week:
   - Alani wrote 20 stories.
   - Braylen wrote 40 stories.
   - Margot wrote 60 stories.

2. In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
   - Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
   - Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
   - Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

3. Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote:
   - First week total: \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) stories.
   - Second week total: \(40 + 80 + 120 = 240\) stories.

4. Adding the totals from both weeks:
   - Total stories: \(120 + 240 = 360\) stories.

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ann is 9 years old. Her brother is twice her age, so we calculate her brother's age as follows:

1. Ann's age = 9 years
2. Her brother's age = 2 × Ann's age = 2 × 9 = 18 years

Now, we want to know how old her brother will be in 3 years. So, we add 3 years to her brother's current age:

1. Her brother's current age = 18 years
2. In 3 years, her brother's age = 18 + 3 = 21 years

So, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old. The correct answer is:

21 years"
"Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters are worth:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes are worth:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Now, Kelly buys a can of pop that costs 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a flag with 76 stars. The flag has 3 rows with 8 stars each, 2 rows with 6 stars each, and the rest are 5-star rows. We need to find out how many 5-star rows there are.

First, let's find out how many stars are in the rows with 8 stars and 6 stars:
- 3 rows with 8 stars each: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- 2 rows with 6 stars each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add the stars from these rows:
- Total stars in rows of 8 and 6 stars: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

Next, we subtract the stars in these rows from the total number of stars to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows:
- Total stars in 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

Now, we need to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are. Since each row has 5 stars:
- Number of 5-star rows: \(40 \div 5 = 8\) rows

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To find out how many trucks are needed, we first calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know each truck can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

So, we need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"To find out how long the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we need to divide the total distance by the speed of the car in the slow lane.

The car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles per hour because it's half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles per hour.

So, we divide 480 miles by 30 miles per hour:

\[
\frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance. The correct answer is:

\boxed{B} (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, but since the correct answer is 16 hours, we should note that the multiple-choice format is not provided here.)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so:
\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]
So, Izzy has 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have:
\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]
medals.

The problem says that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means:
\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]
So, the total number of medals given out is 390.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct option in a multiple-choice question format, if provided.)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars.
2. So, the total number of chocolate bars is \(8 \times 5 = 40\).
3. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
4. So, the total number of chocolate bars the adults get is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).
5. Now, we subtract the chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars: \(40 - 24 = 16\).
6. There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them.
7. So, each child gets \(16 \div 8 = 2\) chocolate bars.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Susan works for 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. But she takes a 30-minute break, so she works for 150 minutes.

She earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns in 10 minutes, we divide $5 by 10, which gives us $0.5 per minute.

Now, to find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we multiply 150 by $0.5. So, 150 times $0.5 is $75.

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task. The correct answer is C."
"Let's solve this step by step, just like in a primary school.

1. **Points after three rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

3. **Total points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike: \(21 + 0 = 21\) points
   - Jim: \(18 + 0 = 18\) points
   - Tony: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points

4. **Sum the total points:**
   - \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\)

So, the total points all three players have after the extra points are distributed is 82.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"Will bought 15 oranges. He asked his two sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. So, the total number of oranges washed is 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will started with 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The number of oranges left unwashed is 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

Darren did 100 pushups on the first day and 120 pushups on the second day. So, the total pushups he did are:
100 + 120 = 220

On the first day, he did 50 squats and on the second day, he did 40 squats. So, the total squats are:
50 + 40 = 90

On the first day, he did 20 dumbbell presses and on the second day, he did 40 dumbbell presses. So, the total dumbbell presses are:
20 + 40 = 60

Now, to find the total count of all activities, we add up all the totals:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

So, the total count of the activities he did in the two days is 370. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We know that each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 people in the household, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner. So, each day, they eat:
\[ 5 \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the amount they eat each day:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the number of days by 7:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to add up all the crates he sold during the week and then see how many he missed.

First, let's add up the crates sold:
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many he missed, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much John pays a year for driving.

1. **Calculate the total distance John drives in a year:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day.
   - So, he drives 60 miles each day.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week.
   - There are 50 weeks in a year.
   - Total miles driven in a year: \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - The cost is $2 per mile.
   - Total cost for miles driven: \(15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year}\).

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver per year:**
   - The bonus is $150 per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total bonus per year: \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\).

4. **Calculate the total cost for the year:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $30000
   - Total bonus per year: $1800
   - Total cost for the year: \(30000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 31800 \text{ dollars}\).

So, John pays a year for driving is $31800. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first add the minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday. On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes, and on Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. So, we add these two numbers together:

\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. So, we multiply 39 by 2:

\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday. The correct answer is:

78 minutes"
"To figure out how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's think about it step by step.

1. When you fold a piece of paper vertically, you can print 4 pages on it. This is because you can print one page on the front and one page on the back.
2. A 32-page tabloid means you have 32 pages to print.
3. To find out how many pieces of paper you need, you divide the total number of pages by the number of pages you can print on one piece of paper. So, you do 32 divided by 4.

Let's do the division:
\[ 32 \div 4 = 8 \]

So, you need 8 pieces of paper to print a 32-page tabloid.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Annika had $50 to spend at the fair. She first spent half of it on food and snacks. So, she spent:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying food and snacks, she had:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent $10 more on rides. So, the total amount she spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the money she started with:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Annika has $15 left. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Elise has 250 books in total. At the end of the year, she has 50 books left unsold. So, the number of books she sold this year is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

She sold 45 books this year. In the first year, she sold twice as many books as she sold this year. So, in the first year, she sold:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Now, let's find out how many books she sold in the second year. We know the total number of books sold over the three years is 250. So, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[ 250 - (90 + 45) = 250 - 135 = 115 \]

Each book sells for $20. So, the money she earned in the second year is:
\[ 115 \times 20 = 2300 \]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[ 2300 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate how much Watson earns in a day:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how much he earns in a week:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since the company performed very well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:
\[ 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks are in April. April has 30 days, and Watson works 5 days a week. So, the number of weeks in April is:
\[ \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{5 \, \text{days/week}} = 6 \, \text{weeks} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, the total bonus for 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \, \text{weeks} \times 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 1800 \, \text{\$} \]

Now, we add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the total bonus to find his total earnings for April:
\[ 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 6 \, \text{weeks} + 1800 \, \text{\$} = 4800 \, \text{\$} + 1800 \, \text{\$} = 6600 \, \text{\$} \]

So, Watson made $6600 in April. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]"
"John played arm wrestle with 20 people. He beat 80% of them. To find out how many he lost to, we first need to know how many he beat.

80% of 20 is calculated by:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he played against:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

John lost to 4 people.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of the loaves. So, we calculate two-thirds of 60:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After selling 40 loaves in the morning, the bakery has:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves left}
   \]
4. In the afternoon and evening, they sell half of the remaining loaves equally. So, we take half of the 20 loaves left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{B}
\]

(Note: Since the problem statement does not provide multiple-choice options, I've assumed B as the correct answer based on the calculation. If you have specific multiple-choice options, please provide them.)"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. So, to find out how much Joey loses in one week, we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \div 4 \text{ weeks} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Now, we know Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in one week), we can set up a simple ratio:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how much you save, let's break it down step by step.

First, we look at the ice cream. The ice cream was originally $13, but now it's $11. So, for one tub of ice cream, you save $13 - $11 = $2.

Since you're buying 2 tubs of ice cream, you save $2 * 2 = $4 from the ice cream.

Next, we look at the milk. Each packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. If you buy 4 packets, you save $0.5 * 4 = $2 from the milk.

Now, to find the total savings, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk together. So, $4 + $2 = $6.

The total amount you save is $6."
"To find out how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to count the extra arms and extra legs that grow.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, we can count how many 3-day periods fit into 15 days: \(15 \div 3 = 5\).
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, we can count how many 5-day periods fit into 15 days: \(15 \div 5 = 3\).
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we add the extra arms and extra legs together:
- Extra arms: 5
- Extra legs: 3
- Total new limbs: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

So, after fifteen days, the person will grow 8 new limbs.

The correct answer is:
8"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Theo has $6000 for his trip. He spends some money on different things:
- He buys 6 business suits at $100 each. So, 6 suits cost $100 × 6 = $600.
- He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each. So, 3 suitcases cost $50 × 3 = $150.
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of one business suit. One business suit costs $100, so 5 times that is $100 × 5 = $500. Adding $700 to that gives $500 + $700 = $1200 for the flight ticket.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Business suits: $600
- Suitcases: $150
- Flight ticket: $1200

Total cost so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the money he can spend on other things is:
- Total money - Money saved = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, we subtract the cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the money he can spend:
- Money to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa. The correct answer is:

C. $2050"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have a family of 5 people. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day. We need to find out how many eggs they eat in a week.

First, let's find out how many eggs the three people eat in a day:
- Each of the three people eats 3 eggs.
- So, 3 people eat \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs in a day.

Next, let's find out how many eggs the other two people eat in a day:
- Each of the two people eats 2 eggs.
- So, 2 people eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs in a day.

Now, let's add the eggs eaten by all five people in a day:
- Total eggs eaten in a day = Eggs eaten by the three people + Eggs eaten by the two people
- Total eggs eaten in a day = \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they eat in a week (7 days):
- Total eggs eaten in a week = Eggs eaten in a day \(\times\) Number of days in a week
- Total eggs eaten in a week = \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

So, the family will eat 91 eggs in a week. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Quinn is 30 years old. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so we subtract 3 from 30 to find out how old Jane is.

\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \]

So, Jane is 27 years old. Now, Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age to find out how old Trent is.

\[ 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

Six years ago, Cera was 40 years old (46 - 6). At that time, Noah was half her age, so Noah was 20 years old (40 / 2).

Now, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now. Also, it was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. So, six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times 20, which is 60000.

If 60000 is half of the current population, then the current population is 60000 times 2, which is 120000.

So, the population of Chile now is 120000.

The correct answer is C. 120000."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the total number of players on the team is 105. We also know there are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense, and half the number of players on the special teams as on the defense.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).

Then the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) (because it's twice the number of players on the defense).

And the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \) (because it's half the number of players on the defense).

So, the total number of players is:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's combine the terms:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So, we have:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we need to solve this equation. First, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Martha invited some people to her party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each, and 3 families with 4 people each. First, we need to find out how many people that is in total.

2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Now, 8 people couldn't come because they were sick. Also, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come because of illness had other reasons. So, we need to find out how many people that is:
\[8 \div 4 = 2\]

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is 14. The correct answer is:
\[\boxed{14}\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. He also got 2/5 times as many marbles from his father. First, we need to find out how many marbles his father gave him.

To find out how many marbles his father gave him, we do:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, his father gave him 8 marbles. Now, we add the marbles he bought to the marbles his father gave him:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \]

So, Solomon has 28 marbles in total. Each marble weighs 2 kg. To find the total weight of all the marbles, we multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble:
\[ 28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is 56 kg. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we first need to know the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:

\[ 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it costs $0.1 to fill one cubic foot. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12. The correct answer is:

**B**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know there are 30 boys in the classroom. The problem tells us there are 3 times as many girls as boys. So, we can find out how many girls there are by doing:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 girls.

The problem also says there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. So, we can find out how many nongendered children there are by doing:

\[ \frac{30}{10} = 3 \]

So, there are 3 nongendered children.

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123.

The correct answer is C. 123."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

We are given that the total number of wires is 45. To find out how many poles we need, we can use the ratio.

If 3 wires correspond to 1 pole, then we can find out how many poles correspond to 45 wires by dividing 45 by 3.

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's solve the problem step by step as if we are in primary school.

1. **Initial number of people:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total people: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left:**
   - Number of people who left: 1/4 of 40 = 10
   - Number of people remaining: 40 - 10 = 30

3. **Given that 22 men stayed at the party:**
   - Number of men who left: 25 - 22 = 3
   - Number of women who left: 10 - 3 = 7 (since 10 people left in total and 3 were men, the rest must be women)

4. **Number of women remaining:**
   - Initial number of women: 15
   - Number of women who left: 7
   - Number of women remaining: 15 - 7 = 8

So, the number of women left at the party is 8.

The correct answer is **8**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book. So, we calculate the cost of the magazine:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

The correct answer is:

\[ \text{C} \]"
"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Jam has 26 pencils in total. These pencils are in 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils. So, if we add the pencils in the boxes and the loose pencils together, we get:
\[ 3 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ pencils per box} + 2 \text{ loose pencils} = 26 \text{ pencils} \]

This means each box has 8 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed for 72 pencils in total (Jam's 26 pencils plus Meg's 46 pencils).

So, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pencils}}{8 \text{ pencils per box}} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many milliliters weaker the iced coffee is, we need to focus on the cooling part because adding cream doesn't change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters weaker.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

The addition of cream (15 milliliters) doesn't change the milliliters weaker, so we just use the cooling effect.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]

"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simple way.

First, we know there are 100 people working in the company. Out of these, 40 are junior programmers and the rest are senior programmers. So, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 a month. So, the total money paid to all junior programmers is:
\[ 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

We also know that each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer. So, each senior programmer is paid:
\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Now, the total money paid to all senior programmers is:
\[ 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers, we add the money paid to junior programmers and senior programmers:
\[ 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224000.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We start with some people at the terminal.
2. At the first stop, 5 more people get on the bus. So now we have \( x + 5 \) people.
3. At the second stop, 7 people get off and 8 more get on. So we subtract 7 and add 8, which is the same as adding 1 more person. Now we have \( x + 5 - 7 + 1 = x + 1 \) people.
4. We know that after the second stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So we can write the equation: \( x + 1 = 20 \).
5. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation. We do this by subtracting 1 from both sides: \( x = 20 - 1 \).
6. So, \( x = 19 \).

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 19. The correct answer is:

3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. The customer spent $80 last time and got $4 in rewards because for every $20 spent, they get $1 off. So, $80 / $20 = 4, which means 4 rewards.
2. This time, they spent $43. They used their 4 rewards, so that's $4 off.
3. They also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took $4 * 2 = $8 off.
4. First, we subtract the rewards from the $43: $43 - $4 = $39.
5. Then, we subtract the coupon: $39 - $8 = $31.

So, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate, we need to compare the net pay from both jobs.

For Job A:
- Nick works 2000 hours a year.
- He gets paid $15 per hour.
- The state tax rate is 20%.
- So, the total income before tax is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
- The state tax is 20% of $30,000, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000.
- The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B:
- Nick gets paid $42,000 a year.
- The state charges $6,000 in property tax.
- So, the net income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
- The state tax rate on the net income is 10%.
- The tax on the net income is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.
- The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, we compare the net pay:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

To find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B:
- $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 220 castles in Scotland.
2. 40 percent of these castles are ruins. To find out how many that is, we calculate 40% of 220:
   - 40% of 220 = 0.40 * 220 = 88.
   So, there are 88 ruined castles.
3. Half of these ruined castles are unmanned. To find out how many that is, we calculate half of 88:
   - Half of 88 = 88 / 2 = 44.
   So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44.

"To find out how much more Furniture United's offer costs compared to Cozy Homes' offer, we need to add up the costs for each offer and then see the difference.

First, let's add up the costs for Furniture United's offer:
- They ask for an advance payment of $1,350.
- They also ask for 6 monthly payments of $350 each. So, the total for these payments is $350 times 6, which is $2,100.
- Adding the advance payment and the monthly payments together, the total cost for Furniture United is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Now, let's do the same for Cozy Homes' offer:
- They ask for an advance payment of $1,100.
- They also ask for 9 monthly payments of $250 each. So, the total for these payments is $250 times 9, which is $2,250.
- Adding the advance payment and the monthly payments together, the total cost for Cozy Homes is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, to find out how much more Furniture United's offer costs, we subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer:
- $3,450 (Furniture United's total) - $3,350 (Cozy Homes' total) = $100.

So, the cost difference is $100. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they share them equally, we need to add up all the guns and then divide by the number of people.

First, let's add up all the guns:
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

So, we add these numbers together:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Now, we have 24 guns in total and there are 4 people. To find out how many guns each person gets, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:
\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

So, each person would have 6 guns.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to add up the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers needs 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.

So, the total sugar for the suckers is:
\[ 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge needs 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.

So, the total sugar for the fudge is:
\[ 1 \times 70 = 70 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{C}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Maria bought 8 shares of a stock, and each share cost $8. So, the total cost was:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The price of the stock went up by 50% the first year. To find out how much it went up, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4 \]
So, the new price of the stock after the first year is:
\[ \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at the new price of $12 each. So, the total value after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

Then, the price of the stock went down by 25% in the second year. To find out how much it went down, we calculate:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3 \]
So, the new price of the stock after the second year is:
\[ \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at the new price of $9 each. So, the total value after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]

The correct answer is D."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so Thomas ate \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hot dogs.
John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) hot dogs.

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:
\[3 - 2 = 1\]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The answer is 1."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have a class of 200 students. These students are split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's say each of the two equal groups has \( x \) students. So, the third group will have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The third group, which is the smallest, has:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's figure out how many chickens and cows he has.

If we let the number of cows be \( C \), then the number of chickens is \( 2C \) because he has twice as many chickens as cows. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3C = 60 \]

To find \( C \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, he has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

chickens.

Now, let's count the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs is:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow} + 40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs per chicken} \]

\[ = 80 + 80 \]

\[ = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts with 3 balls. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act. After 4 weeks, he adds 4 more balls (because 1 ball each week for 4 weeks is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4). So, he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls in total.

But when he walks on stage, he drops 3 balls. So, he has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left.

The number of balls Josh has left to juggle is 4.

The correct answer is:
4"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the weight of the pink frog is 50 pounds. Here are the weights of the other animals based on the information given:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it's 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it's 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it's 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it's 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to add the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds.

So, the total weight is:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Tyson usually runs 5000 meters each day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters each day. So, we need to find out how much more he should run each day and then add that to his usual distance.

First, we find out how much more he should run:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, he should run:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters each day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many meters he runs in a month. June has 30 days, so:
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters. The correct answer is:

"Jenny buys cookies every week. Each bag has 36 cookies. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. We need to find out how many cookies Jenny eats.

First, let's see how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box in a week:
- She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box each day.
- She does this for 5 days a week.
- So, she puts \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies in her son's lunch box in a week.

Next, let's see how many cookies her husband eats in a week:
- Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.
- So, he eats \(1 \times 7 = 7\) cookies in a week.

Now, let's find out how many cookies are left for Jenny:
- Jenny starts with 36 cookies.
- She puts 20 cookies in her son's lunch box.

"To find out what percentage more they are making per day now, we need to compare the old and new daily revenues.

First, we know they used to make $1000 a day from selling tractors. Now, they make $1100 a day from selling silos.

To find out how much more they are making, we subtract the old amount from the new amount:
$1100 - $1000 = $100

Now, to find out what percentage this $100 is of the old $1000, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New amount} - \text{Old amount}}{\text{Old amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]

So, we have:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{1100 - 1000}{1000} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the costs of food, treats, and medicine for a year.

First, let's find out how much she spends on food, treats, and medicine in one month:

- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add up the costs for one month:
- Food: $100
- Treats: $20
- Medicine: $100
- Total for one month: \(100 + 20 + 100 = 220\) dollars.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find the yearly cost:

"Let's break down the time John spent on different activities and then find out how much time he spent sightseeing.

First, we know John spent:
- 6 hours boating
- Half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming
- 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows

Adding these up, the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours

This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent. To find the total time, we can set up the equation:
0.30 * Total Time = 15 hours

To find the Total Time, we divide 15 by 0.30:
Total Time = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours

"Let's solve this step by step.

Billy has $10 to buy candy. The candy costs $1.50 per pound. First, we need to find out how much money Billy has left after buying the candy.

If Billy buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, he spends:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This $2 is half of the change he has left after buying the candy. So, the total change he has is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know that the total money Billy had minus the cost of the candy equals the change he has left. So, if we let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he bought, the cost of the candy is:
\[ 1.5x \]

The money left after buying the candy is:
\[ 10 - 1.5x = 4 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 10 - 4 = 1.5x \]
\[ 6 = 1.5x \]
\[ x = \frac{6}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The correct answer is:

First, we need to find out what twice the son's age is. We can add 5 to both sides of the equation to get:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2 \times \text{son's age} \]
\[ 50 = 2 \times \text{son's age} \]

Now, to find the son's age, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \text{son's age} = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ \text{son's age} = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one day and then see how many days it takes to travel 18,000 miles.

First, let's find the total distance for one complete trip:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip. The combined distance of the second and third city trip is 100 miles + 75 miles = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city back to the first city is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

Now, let's add these distances to find the total distance for one complete trip:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ miles}}{18,000 \text{ miles}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days} \]

Since \(\frac{1}{20}\) of a day is 12 hours, the train goes between services every 12 hours. The correct answer is:

- A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed needs the average of what a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed need.

To find the average for the collie bed:
\[ \text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

For 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. So, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach 42 points.

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. The correct answer is:

**C. 9**"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

We know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. Now, we need to find out how many were kicked out for other reasons. Here's how we can do it:

1. First, we find out how many were kicked out for shoplifting. It's four times the number of those who didn't wear masks minus 5. So, \(4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7\). That means 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
2. Next, we find out how many were kicked out for violence. It's three times the number of those who shoplifted. So, \(3 \times 7 = 21\). That means 21 customers were kicked out for violence.
3. Now, we add up all the customers who were kicked out: 3 (for not wearing masks) + 7 (for shoplifting) + 21 (for violence) = 31.
4. We know the total number of customers kicked out was 50. So, to find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the 31 from 50: \(50 - 31 = 19\).

So, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 19. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, we calculate how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points:
   - Three times Sara's points: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
   - Erin scored 14 points, so we add that to Sara's points to find out how many points Erin has now: \(24 + 14 = 38\)
3. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from the 38 points she has now:
   - Points Erin had before: \(38 - 14 = 24\)

So, Erin had 24 points before scoring the 14 points. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"To find out how much will be spent on the senior gifts, we need to add up the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames:
- Each picture frame costs $20.
- Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost, so the total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
- There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins:
- 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
- The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers:
- 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
- Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
- The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add up all these costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much Ethan would pay if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. So, we first find out what 20% of $400 is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$400 = 0.20 \times 400 = \$80 \]

Now, we subtract this savings from the original cost to find the total cost for Ethan:

\[ \$400 - \$80 = \$320 \]

So, Ethan would pay $320 if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
On Saturday, they sold double that number, so that's 14 pairs * 2 = 28 pairs.
On Sunday, they sold half the number they sold on Saturday, so that's 28 pairs / 2 = 14 pairs.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold:
14 pairs (Friday) + 28 pairs (Saturday) + 14 pairs (Sunday) = 56 pairs.

But 6 pairs were returned, so we need to subtract those:
56 pairs - 6 pairs = 50 pairs.

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

The company bought $400,000 worth of equipment. We know that 40% of the equipment is faulty. To find out how much the company spent on the functioning pieces, we need to figure out how much 60% of the total cost is because 100% - 40% = 60%.

First, let's find out how much 40% of $400,000 is:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.4 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the faulty pieces cost $160,000. So, the cost of the functioning pieces is the total cost minus the cost of the faulty pieces:
\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The correct answer is:

"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them give 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give 2 kg of milk each. To find out how much milk she gets every day, we can do this step by step.

First, we find out how many sheep give 1 kg of milk:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sheep} \]
So, these 15 sheep give:
\[ 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ kg of milk} \]

Next, we find out how many sheep give 2 kg of milk:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sheep} \]
So, these 15 sheep give:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ kg of milk} \]

Now, we add the milk from both groups of sheep:
\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \]

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct option in a multiple-choice question format.)"

She then broke each of the remaining 6 bread rolls into 8 pieces. So, she made 6 × 8 = 48 pieces of bread. The number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 48. 

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We have 40 pupils in the class. Half of them like blue. So, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ 40 \div 2 = 20 \]

So, 20 pupils like blue.

Now, we subtract the 20 pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

This means 20 pupils are left. One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green. So, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, 5 pupils like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. We subtract the 5 pupils who like green from the remaining 20 pupils:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow. The correct answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday and got $56 from selling them at $4 per apple. To find out how many apples she sold, we divide $56 by $4:
   \[
   \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. So, we multiply the number of apples picked on Tuesday by 2:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. Now, we add up all the apples picked over the three days:
   \[
   14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples}

"To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months with interest and then divide that by five.

First, let's calculate the total amount she will owe. The formula for the total amount is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Months}} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (r) = 10% = 0.10
- Number of Months (n) = 5

So, the total amount is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5884.4115 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay each month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5884.4115}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.88 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1176.88 each month.

"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel and 40 more gold pesos than Axel.

First, let's find out how many silver pesos Anna has:
- Axel has 50 silver pesos.
- Anna has twice as many, so \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

Next, let's find out how many gold pesos Anna has:
- Axel has 80 gold pesos.
- Anna has 40 more than Axel, so \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the silver pesos they have together:
- Axel has 50 silver pesos.
- Anna has 100 silver pesos.
- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.

Now, let's add up all the gold pesos they have together:
- Axel has 80 gold pesos.
- Anna has 120 gold pesos.
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, let's add the total number of silver and gold pesos together:
- Total silver pesos: 150

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Millie spends $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make 36 cups of lemonade.
2. She sells each cup for $1. So, if she sells all 36 cups, she makes $36.
3. It takes her 9 hours to sell all 36 cups because she sells 4 cups per hour. So, she sells 4 cups in 1 hour, 8 cups in 2 hours, and so on, until she sells all 36 cups in 9 hours.
4. The cost to make the lemonade is $18. So, her profit is $36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18.
5. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. So, $18 ÷ 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is $2. The correct answer is:

"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, so he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares. To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1 whole (or 5/5) of his land would be.

If 2 parts out of 5 parts are 12.8 hectares, then 1 part out of 5 parts would be:
\[ 12.8 \div 2 = 6.4 \text{ hectares} \]

So, 5 parts (which is the whole amount of land) would be:
\[ 6.4 \times 5 = 32 \text{ hectares} \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{C} \]

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, let's find out how many parts the total number of popsicles is divided into. The total parts are 5 (for Betty) + 6 (for Sam) = 11 parts.

Now, we know that 11 parts make up 165 popsicles. To find out how many popsicles are in one part, we divide 165 by 11:

\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

So, each part is 15 popsicles.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Tim wants to cancel his cable package and get streaming services instead. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% by bundling them. We need to find out how much money he saves by cancelling his $60 cable package.

First, let's find out how much Hulu and Disney Plus cost after the 20% savings:
- Normally, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 each, so together they cost $10 + $10 = $20.
- He saves 20% on this, so the savings are $20 * 20% = $20 * 0.20 = $4.
- After the savings, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix and the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the savings:
- Netflix costs $10.
- Hulu and Disney Plus cost $16.
- So, the total cost for streaming services is $10 + $16 = $26.

Tim's cable package cost $60, and now he is paying $26 for streaming services. To find out how much money he saves, we subtract the streaming cost from the cable cost:
- $60 - $26 = $34.

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. That's the same as 4 times 60 minutes, which is 240 minutes.

She spends half as much time recording it, so that's 240 minutes divided by 2, which is 120 minutes.

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, to find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we need to add up all the time she spent on each part:
240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes total.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

So we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Then we multiply by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song. The correct answer is:

B"

- Days per year = 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, we know the builder gets paid $50 every day. So, his total earnings in a year are:
- Total earnings = 288 days/year * $50/day = $14400/year

So, the builder earns $14400 in a year. The correct answer is C."
"Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, he needs:
- \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups of flour
- \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups of milk

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
- \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so:
- \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- \(6 - 2 = 4\)

So, Mark needs to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simple way.

Mel uses an air conditioner that uses 900 watts of energy each hour. If he uses it for 8 hours a day, we can calculate how much energy he uses in a day.

First, we find out how much energy he uses in one day:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

So, the energy he saves each day is:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how much energy he saves in 30 days:
\[ 4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Since 1 kilowatt-hour is equal to 1000 watt-hours, we convert the total watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:
\[ 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the energy Mel saves in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct option in a multiple-choice question, if provided)."
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to add up all the stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
   - One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

   Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88
   \]

2. Determine the number of zebras:
   - There are 3 zebras in total.

3. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} = \frac{88}{3}
   \]

4. Perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{88}{3} = 29.3333
   \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is approximately 29.33.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{29.33}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Tyson wants to make muffaletta sandwiches for a big game. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and it serves 4 people. There are 20 people going to watch the game, so Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve all 20 people.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make:
- Each sandwich serves 4 people.
- There are 20 people.
- So, the number of sandwiches needed is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

Next, we need to know how much meat and cheese are needed:
- Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat.
- Each sandwich needs 1 pound of cheese.
- So, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson needs \( 5 \) pounds of meat and \( 5 \) pounds of cheese.

Now, let's look at the cost:
- Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
- Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
- So, the cost of 5 pounds of meat is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \) dollars.
- And the cost of 5 pounds of cheese is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost is \( 35 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

So, Tyson would spend \(\boxed{50}\) dollars on the meat and cheese."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Allan starts with 40 cannolis. Then he buys 60 more, so he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis now.

He also starts with twice as many corns as cannolis. So, he starts with 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

But then he buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has now. Since he has 100 cannolis now, he buys 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

So, the total number of corns he has now is 80 - 40 + 60 = 100 corns.

Now, to find the total number of corns and cannolis, we add them together: 100 cannolis + 100 corns = 200.

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 200.

The correct answer is C. 200."
"Let's break it down step by step:

Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already walked half of his steps to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. Then he walked 1,000 more steps with his friend. So far, he has walked 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he still needs to walk 2,000 steps to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means he walked 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 2,000.

The correct answer is:
\boxed{B} (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, which is not provided in the original question but is included here for the sake of following the multiple-choice format requirement.)"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Toby needs to read a book that is 45 pages long. Each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads 300 words in one minute. So, the time it takes him to read the whole book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to finish reading the book 50 minutes before he needs to leave the airport. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming the multiple-choice options were A, B, C, D, and the correct answer was B)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the company paid in May. In May, they hired 40 employees, and each worked 40 hours a week at $15 an hour. So, each employee was paid:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 600 \text{ dollars/employee} \]
Since there were 40 employees, the total amount paid in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 600 \text{ dollars/employee} = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, in June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees who had their contracts expired is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]
This means there are:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]
These 30 employees worked the same number of hours as in May, which is 40 hours a week. So, each of these 30 employees was paid:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 600 \text{ dollars/employee} \]
The total amount paid to these 30 employees in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 600 \text{ dollars/employee} = 18000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount paid in both months, we add the amounts from May and June:
\[ 24000 \text{ dollars} + 18000 \text{ dollars} = 42000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{42000}\)."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Taffy:
   - Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. Seashells:
   - Each seashell costs $1.50.
   - Sally bought 4 seashells, so the total cost is 4 × $1.50 = $6.00.

3. Magnets:
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost is 4 × $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $6.00
- Magnets: $1.00
- Total cost: $4.50 + $6.00 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's parents gave her $10. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
- $10 - $11.50 = -$1.50.

Since the result is -$1.50, it means Sally is short by $1.50. So, the correct answer is that Sally has $0 left and is short by $1.50.

The correct option is:
\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tim buys two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much as the first pack, so it costs $800. Adding these together, the total cost of the fireworks is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 1200 = 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

So, the discount is $240. We subtract this discount from the total cost of the fireworks:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim buys a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount Tim spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, Tim spent a total of $1110. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Her recipe makes 12 cookies at a time. To find out how many times she needs to make the recipe to get 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in one batch:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/batch}} = 5 \text{ batches} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 batches of cookies to last her for 30 days. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Marcy makes 50,000 candles. Out of these, 5% are dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. So, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles will explode.

First, we calculate how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 50,000 = 2,500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we know that 1% of these dangerous candles will explode. So, we calculate how many of these dangerous candles will explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 2,500 = \frac{1}{100} \times 2,500 = 25 \text{ candles} \]

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Misha is buying 4 blouses, and each blouse is originally $20. There's a 30% discount on each blouse. First, we need to find out how much the discount is for one blouse.

The discount is 30% of $20, which is:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{30}{100} \times 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

So, the discount amount for one blouse is $6. This means the sale price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha is buying 4 blouses, so we need to find out the total cost for 4 blouses at the sale price of $14 each:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

So, the total cost for the 4 blouses is $56. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so that's 60 apples.
4. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so that's 45 apples.
5. Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Now, let's add up the apples Joanne gathered:
- From the tallest trees: 30 apples
- From the shortest trees: 15 apples
- From the average trees: Let's call this number \( A \)

So, the total apples Joanne gathered is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A = 45 + A \]

The total apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. So, we can write:
\[ 45 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{C} \] (Assuming the correct answer is one of the options C, if C is 350)"
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step.

We know there are 180 heads in total. If we count the heads, we have 180 heads. Camels and dromedaries each have one head, so the number of heads is the same as the number of animals.

We also know there are 304 humps. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. So, if we have \( c \) camels and \( d \) dromedaries, the total number of humps can be written as:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We also know:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

Now, let's solve these two equations. From the second equation, we can express \( c \) in terms of \( d \):
\[ c = 180 - d \]

Next, we substitute \( c = 180 - d \) into the first equation:
\[ 2(180 - d) + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2d + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - d = 304 \]
\[ -d = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -d = -56 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many kilometers Tom traveled in total.

First, we look at the first 4 days:
- Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
- So, for 4 days, he traveled \(200 \times 4 = 800\) kilometers.

Next, we look at the next 2 days:
- He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
- So, for the next 2 days, he traveled \(800 \times 0.30 = 240\) kilometers.

Then, we look at the next day:
- He didn't travel at all, so that's 0 kilometers.

Now, we look at the second week:
- He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
- So, for 7 days, he traveled \(300 \times 7 = 2100\) kilometers.

To find the total distance, we add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

So, the total distance is \(800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140\) kilometers.

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."

We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find out how big Zack's locker is by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

So, Zack's locker is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, we can find out how big Timothy's locker is by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Mr. Josue got money from two places. The first place gave him $4000. The second place gave him twice as much as the first place, so that's $4000 times 2, which is $8000.

Now, if we add the money from both places, we get:
$4000 + $8000 = $12000

Mr. Josue already had $5000 in his store. So, if we add the $12000 he got to the $5000 he already had, we get:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in his store. The correct answer is C."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and each boat took 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

After the boats took the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. First, we find out how many cats ran after the mouse:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock after some ran after the mouse is:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12. The correct answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Cole bought two types of jeans: tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's find out how much he saved from each type of jeans.

First, we calculate the total savings from the jogger jeans:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means he saved $2 from the jogger jeans. Since he saved the rest from the tattered jeans, we can find out how much he saved from the tattered jeans:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the tattered jeans originally cost than the jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $22. So, the difference is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The answer is:

"Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100. He sells his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each. After selling the cards, he has $50 left to spend on the ticket.

If he has $50 left after buying the ticket, that means he had $100 (cost of the ticket) + $50 (his money) = $150 before buying the ticket.

Now, we need to find out how many cards he sold to get $150. Each card he sells gives him $1.5. So, we divide the total money he had by the price of each card:

\[ \text{Number of cards} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with 100 cards. The correct answer is:

**A. 100**"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total cost of all the items before any discount. We have:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 times $5.00 is $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 20% off, so we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 165.00 = 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first add up the cost of the items she wants to buy:

- Skipping rope costs $6
- Board game costs $11
- Playground ball costs $2

So, the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. So, the total money Dora has is $2 + $16 = $18.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs. We subtract the total money Dora has from the total cost of the items:

$19 - $18 = $1.

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball. The correct answer is:

C. $1"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur killed three quarters of what Prince Thaddeus killed. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
   Prince Arthur killed 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter killed twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
   Prince Walter killed 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce killed one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]
   Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons.

So, the number of dragons Prince Bruce killed is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we start by figuring out how much gas is in each container. There are 15 gallons of gas divided into 5 containers, so each container has:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. The correct answer is:

**A. 6 pints**"
"Let's break it down again, but this time in a simpler way.

George spent $5 in total. He had 1% left, so he spent $4.95 on chips. Each bag of chips costs $0.40, so he bought 12 bags of chips because 12 times $0.40 is $4.80, which is close to $4.95.

Now, the money left after buying chips is $0.05. The rest of the money he spent on candy bars. So, he spent $5 - $4.95 = $0.05 on candy bars. Each candy bar costs $0.75, so he could buy only one candy bar because $0.05 is less than $0.75.

So, George bought 1 candy bar. The correct answer is:

B (assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format)"
"Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 lollipops for himself, so he shared the rest with his friends. To find out how many lollipops he shared, we subtract the 5 he kept from the 25 he had:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Now, Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend got, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops. The correct answer is:

**B**"
"Rory made a big cake that was 20 ounces heavy. She cut the cake into 8 pieces. So each piece of cake is 20 ÷ 8 = 2.5 ounces.

Rory and her mom each had one piece, so they ate 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 ounces of cake.

The cake left is 20 - 5 = 15 ounces.

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces. The correct answer is C."
"Sitti and Juris have 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. So, together they have:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

They are sharing these oranges with 6 of their friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he doubles that amount. So, he needs 4 pounds of onions.
2. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound. So, for 4 pounds, the cost is 4 times $2.00, which is $8.00.
3. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00. So, for 2 boxes, the cost is 2 times $2.00, which is $4.00.
4. Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock, the total cost is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.
5. The soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00.

So, the cost per serving is $2.00. The correct answer is:

B. $2.00"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. So, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater.

If Wayne takes 4 minutes, and Bernadette takes 4 times as long, then:
\[ \text{Time for Bernadette} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, Bernadette wants to be 5 minutes early, so we subtract Wayne's time from Bernadette's time:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to know the width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet. 

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, we have:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]

To find the width, we divide 360 by 9:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now we know the length is 9 feet and the width is 40 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together twice the length and twice the width:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

Elizabeth bought:

Each pack has 20 beads.

So, the total beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The correct answer is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step as if you are a person with primary school level education.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.
2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Total temperature increase from the oven = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Time the window is open = 30 minutes.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature after the window is closed = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

So, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

The correct answer is:
49"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it took James to swim. Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, and James finished 10% faster. So, we calculate 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes.

10% of 40 minutes is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James took:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know Jon took 80 minutes for the bike ride. James took 5 minutes more than Jon for the bike ride, so:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Jon took 50 minutes for the run. James took the same amount of time for the run as Jon, so:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out the total time James took, we add up the times for each part of the triathlon:
\[ 36 + 85 + 50 = 171 \text{ minutes} \]

We know Jon took 170 minutes, and James took 10 minutes more than Jon. So, we can check if 171 minutes is correct by adding 10 minutes to 170 minutes:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 171 minutes is not 180 minutes, we need to find out how long James took for the run. We already calculated that James took 50 minutes for the run.

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]

The correct option in a multiple-choice format would be:
\[ \boxed{A} \] (assuming A is the correct answer in the multiple-choice options)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is 1.25 times 60 minutes, which is 75 minutes.
2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, Movie B is 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes.
3. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, Movie A is 80 minutes divided by 4, which is 20 minutes.

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long. The correct answer is:

20 minutes"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simpler way.

Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance like this:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Now, for every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

A bail of hay costs $3. So, the total cost of the hay is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has 6 $5 bills, so he has:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the change Michael has is 6 dollars. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs and 2 loose eggs. First, we need to find out how many eggs she has in total. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 4 dozen is 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog. The correct answer is:

B. 2"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Joey had 214 points. He got 26 more points, so his new total is:
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Marcy had 225 points. She got 10 more points, so her new total is:
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, to find out how many more points Joey has than Marcy, we subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. To find out how much each sneaker cost, we divide $576 by 48:

\[
576 \div 48 = 12 \text{ dollars per sneaker}
\]

Next, the salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday. So, the money he got from selling these sneakers is:

\[
17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, he sold the rest of the sneakers to a department store. The number of sneakers left is:

\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

He sold these 31 sneakers for $25 each. So, the money he got from selling these sneakers is:

\[
31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the money he got from both sales to find the total money he made:

\[
340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much profit he made, we subtract the cost of the sneakers from the total money he made:

\[
1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the salesman's profit is $539. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two choices:
1. A super ticket for $20 that includes a popcorn and a soda.
2. A movie ticket for $12 and then you can buy a popcorn and a soda separately.

The problem says you saved $2 by choosing the super ticket. So, if you spent $2 more on the separate ticket, it would be:
\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \]

Now, we know the super ticket costs $21, and it includes a popcorn and a soda. The soda costs $3. So, if we subtract the cost of the soda from the total cost of the super ticket, we get the cost of the popcorn:
\[ 21 - 3 = 18 \]

But we need to find the regular price of the popcorn, and we know the super ticket includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, if the super ticket costs $21 and the soda costs $3, the popcorn must cost:
\[ 21 - 14 = 8 \]

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $8.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{8} \]"
"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how much it cost to fill one balloon after the price increase. The original cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost for one balloon was:
   \[
   \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   After the price increase, each balloon cost:
   \[
   45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price of $65 each:
   \[
   170 \times 65 = 10,850 \text{ dollars}

"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance is \(60 \times 2 = 120\) miles.
- For the second part, the car drives 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. So, the distance is \(30 \times 1 = 30\) miles.

Now, we add these distances to find the total distance:
\[120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\]

Next, we add the times to find the total time:
\[2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\]

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[\text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}\]

So, the car's average speed is 50 miles per hour. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800, and each ruby is worth $1200.

First, we find out how many sapphires Jenna has left after trading:
\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the value of the rubies she got:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is $6400. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can do the following:

1. First, we know that Marin eats 4 apples a day and Nancy also eats 4 apples a day.
2. So, together they eat \(4 + 4 = 8\) apples a day.
3. Now, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. We do this by multiplying the number of apples they eat in one day by 30.
4. So, \(8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples}\).

Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is 240 apples. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we first calculate the volume of one raised bed. Each raised bed is 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:

\[ 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. So, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is $1920. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{D} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I have a primary school education.

We have 15 red cards. Now, we need to find out how many green cards there are. The problem says there are 60% more green cards than red cards. So, we need to find 60% of 15 and add that to 15.

First, let's find 60% of 15:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 15 = \frac{60}{100} \times 15 = 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The problem says the number of yellow cards is the same as the sum of red and green cards. So, we add the number of red cards and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is 78. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Katelyn saw 50 fairies in the sky. After 20 minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. So, her friend saw half of 50, which is 25 fairies. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there. So now, there are 50 + 25 = 75 fairies in the sky.

Then, 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, we need to subtract 30 from 75. That means 75 - 30 = 45 fairies are left.

So, the number of fairies remaining is 45. The correct answer is C."
"To find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, we count all the puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. So, we add these together:
   \[
   8 + 12 = 20
   \]
   So, there are 20 puppies in total.

2. Next, we count how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's puppies with spots are 3, and Brandon's puppies with spots are 4. So, we add these together:
   \[
   3 + 4 = 7
   \]
   So, 7 puppies have spots.

3. Now, to find out what percentage of the puppies have spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100:
   \[
   \left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 100 = 35\%
   \]

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each type of feed weighs in total:

1. Sugar cubes: 2 boxes, each 1 pound. So, \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.
2. Carrots: 4 bags, each 12 pounds. So, \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.
3. Hay: 42 bales, each 75 pounds. So, \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.
4. Oats: 20 sacks, each 65 pounds. So, \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Now, let's add all these weights together to find the total weight of the feed:
\[2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings first and then multiply by four.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each aluminum can is worth 2 cents. So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

She also drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents. So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find her total weekly earnings:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

To find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

First, let's find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has:
- She has 6 decks, and each deck has 25 cards.
- So, the total number of basketball cards is \(6 \times 25 = 150\).

Next, let's find out how many baseball cards Miss Maria has:
- She has 5 boxes, and each box has 40 cards.
- So, the total number of baseball cards is \(5 \times 40 = 200\).

Now, let's add the basketball and baseball cards together to find the total number of cards:
- Total cards = 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
- Cards given to students = 350 total cards - 50 cards kept = 300 cards.

If each student gets 10 cards, we can find out how many students she has by dividing the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student gets:
- Number of students = 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students.

So, Miss Maria has 30 students. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{B}

"Let's break it down step by step:

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each. So, the total cost for Becky is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Becky got a $1 discount, so her final cost is:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's look at Kelly. Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each. So, the total cost for Kelly is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly got a 10 percent discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10 percent of 10 dollars:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly's final cost after the discount is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's final cost from Kelly's final cost:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming the multiple-choice options are A, B, C, D, and the correct answer is B, which is $1 more.)"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Bob has to do laundry for 80 rooms. Each room needs:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- 4 pillow cases (because it's twice as many as sheets)
- 8 towels (because it's twice as many as pillow cases)

So, for one room, he needs to wash:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- 4 pillow cases
- 8 towels

That's a total of \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\) pieces of laundry per room.

Now, for 80 rooms, he needs to wash:
\[ 15 \times 80 = 1200 \]

So, the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms is 1200.

The correct answer is:
**A. 1200**"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, so he gets \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.
4. On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, so he gets \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.
5. Now, let's add all the shoes he got: \(10 + 30 + 60 = 100\) shoes.
6. So, after getting these shoes, he has \(200 + 100 = 300\) shoes.
7. On Saturday, he loses 180 shoes, so he has \(300 - 180 = 120\) shoes left.

Therefore, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is 120. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{D}\) (Assuming D is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question.)"
"Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can make is:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes per jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Each pan can hold 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes per pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The pen costs $2. The paper costs $1 less than three times the pen. So, we first find out how much three times the pen costs:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
Then, we subtract $1 from $6 to get the cost of the paper:
\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]
So, the paper costs $5.

Now, we add the cost of the pen and the paper together:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]
The total cost is $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from $10:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 30 students, and each student has 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is:
   \[
   30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ pencils/student} = 300 \text{ pencils}
   \]

2. After two months, 1/5 of the pencils are used. So, we need to find out how many pencils are used:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils}
   \]

3. Now, we subtract the used pencils from the total to find out how many pencils are left:
   \[
   300 - 60 = 240 \text{ pencils}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. The problem says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. We need to find out how many carrot sticks he needs to eat.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks he eats is \( x \).

According to the problem, the number of cookies he can have is:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know he wants 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

1. Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

2. Multiply both sides by 2 to find \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

"To find out what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras is, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know the length of the shark in inches. Since the shark is 10 feet long and 1 foot is 12 inches, we multiply 10 by 12:
   \[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches} \]

2. Next, we know there are 2 remoras, and each remora is 6 inches long. So, we multiply the number of remoras by the length of each remora to get the total length of the remoras:
   \[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

3. Now, to find out what percentage the total length of the remoras is of the shark's body length, we divide the total length of the remoras by the shark's body length and then multiply by 100:
   \[ \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. The correct answer is:

**A. 10%**"

We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students don't have a desktop computer at home.

If 20 students don't have desktop computers, and that represents one-fourth of the total number of students, we can find the total number of students by doing the following:

1. We know that 20 students represent one-fourth of the total number of students.
2. To find the total number of students, we need to divide 20 by one-fourth.

So, we do:
\[ 20 \div \frac{1}{4} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. We need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \]

But we counted the 3 kids who are allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract those 3 kids:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is 20.

"To find out the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees and the number of tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- There are 3 groups of tour guides.
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and there are two tickets, so:
   \[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

2. The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. The normal price is $1500 per day, so:
   \[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
   This is the price for one day at the hotel. For 3 days, it's:
   \[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

3. Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel:
   \[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is $15400. The correct answer is:

We know the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we need to find out how much the 2010 penny weighs.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]

First, we calculate \( \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \):
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny to find the combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 + 36 = 84 \]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on his player.

Each player can hold up to 100 songs. To find out how many more songs each can add, we subtract the number of songs they already have from the maximum number of songs each player can hold.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel. We subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel can add.

The correct answer is:

Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. They picked 60 oranges in total. To find out how many oranges Stetson ate, we do this:

1. First, we calculate 2/5 of 60:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
   \]
   So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

2. For each orange Stetson eats, he has to give up $10. So, to find out how much money he gave up, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:
   \[
   24 \times 10 = 240

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Heather buys 2 packs of razors. Each pack has 4 razors, so she gets 4 + 4 = 8 razors in total.
2. The packs cost $4.00 each, so for 2 packs, it costs $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.
3. Heather has a $2.00 coupon, so after using the coupon, the cost is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.
4. She gets 8 razors for $6.00, so the cost per razor is $6.00 ÷ 8 = $0.75.
5. To convert $0.75 to cents, we multiply by 100, so $0.75 = 75 cents.

Therefore, each individual razor will cost 75 cents.

"To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of all the cheerleaders in the pyramid.

First, we know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the second layer, 2 on the third layer, and 1 on the top.

Let's add up the heights step by step:

1. The 4 girls on the bottom layer are each 64 inches tall:
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The 3 girls on the second layer are each 64 inches tall:
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The 2 girls on the third layer are each 64 inches tall:
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The 1 girl on the top layer is 60 inches tall:
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add all these heights together:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert inches to feet, we know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, we divide the total height in inches by 12:
\[
\frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet}

"To find out how much money Paul spent, we need to add up the cost of his morning rides and afternoon rides over 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day, so he drives 2 times a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

So, the total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day, so he drives 2 times a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

So, the total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:
\[ 120 \text{ oranges} \div 3 \text{ oranges/pie} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, they can make 40 Greek orange pies. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many guests make the costs of the two venues the same, let's think step by step.

For the first venue:
- There's a flat fee of $200.
- Each guest costs $5 for food.
- So, the total cost is $200 plus $5 times the number of guests.

For the second venue:
- Each guest costs $25.
- Food is included in the price, so there's no extra cost for food.

We need to find out how many guests make these costs the same. Let's say the number of guests is \( n \).

For the first venue, the cost is:
\[ 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the cost is:
\[ 25n \]

We set these two costs equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20n \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests that makes the costs the same is 10.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects together. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half as many as Bodhi.

First, let's say David found \( D \) insects. Then Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects, and Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects because David found half as many as Bodhi.

So, the total number of insects they found together is:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Now, let's combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Now, we can find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn.

First, let's find out how many yards Mariah used:
- Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, so she used \( \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \) yards.

Next, let's find out how many yards her grandma used:
- Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein, so she used \( \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \) yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:
- Total yards used = 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards.

The correct answer is:
273 yards."
"Cherrie has 5 friends, and 2 of them want 5 gifts each. So, that's 2 friends × 5 gifts = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each. So, that's 3 friends × 2 gifts = 6 gifts. Cherrie also wants to buy 10 more random gifts. So, to find out the total number of gifts Cherrie buys, we add all these together: 10 gifts + 6 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts. 

The total number of gifts Cherrie buys is 26. 

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I have a primary school education.

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. So, the rug is:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we find twice the width of the rug:
   \[
   2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Now, we add 2 feet to 16 feet to get the length of the couch:
   \[
   16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the couch is 18 feet long.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum. Two of them were strawberry gum, and the other two were different flavors. She paid $2 for each pack of grape gum and $1 for the green apple gum because it was half the price of the grape gum.

So, the total cost for the grape gum is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the green apple gum is:
\[ 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Now, we know the total cost for all the gum is $7. So, the cost for the strawberry gum is:
\[ 7 - 4 - 1 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost for each pack of strawberry gum is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $1.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{A} \] (Assuming A is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if not provided, the answer is $1)"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

Frederick has $24 to spend on wood. He can buy 2 x 4 pieces of wood for $4 each or 2 x 8 pieces of wood for $6 each.

First, let's see how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy:
- Each 2 x 4 costs $4.
- With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4.

Each 2 x 4 gives him 200 sticks. So, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 will give him:
- \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Next, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
- Each 2 x 8 costs $6.
- With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces of 2 x 8.

Each 2 x 8 gives him 400 sticks. So, 4 pieces of 2 x 8 will give him:
- \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

To get the most sticks, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 pieces because they give more sticks than the 2 x 4 pieces.

So, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1600.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00.

The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's find out how much Janet spends on bus trips each week:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes 5 days a week.
- So, she takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) bus trips each week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- Therefore, the total cost for 10 bus trips is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the bus trips:
- Savings = Total cost of bus trips - Cost of bus pass
- Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

We know the farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep. The zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 60 cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 10 sheep.

Now, let's add up all the animals:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

The correct answer is:

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. So, if we add the onions and potatoes Rose bought, we get 12 + 4 = 16.

Since Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought, we divide 16 by 4 to find out how many Sophia bought. So, 16 ÷ 4 = 4.

Therefore, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes, which makes a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

The correct answer is:
4 onions and potatoes."
"To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, we can follow these steps:

1. Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
2. To lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories.
3. So, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn \(30 \times 3500 = 105000\) calories.
4. From December 31st to July 19th, there are 180 days.
5. To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days: \(105000 \div 180 = 583.33\) calories per day.

So, Andy needs to burn 583.33 calories less than he eats each day to lose 30 pounds by his birthday.

"Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. She is told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. First, we need to find out the total distance she will run. She runs 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km, so:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Now, we know that for 1 km, she needs to drink 60 ml of water. So for 2 km, she will need:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 ml of water. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Julie had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes. To find out how much she spent on clothes, we calculate 20% of $500:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, we subtract this amount from the total money she had:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Julie had $400 left after buying clothes. Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find out how much she spent on CDs, we calculate 25% of $400:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, we subtract this amount from the remaining money:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Julie has $300 left after buying CDs. So, the final amount of money Julie has left is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know the house costs three times as much as the lot. Let's call the cost of the lot \( L \). So, the house costs \( 3L \).

If we add the cost of the house and the lot together, we get:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

So, the lot costs $30,000. Now, to find the cost of the house, we multiply the cost of the lot by 3:
\[ 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house costs $90,000.

Next, we need to find out how much money she spent on these bags. Each pack costs $4, so:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money she made from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, so:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit she made, we subtract the money she spent from the money she made:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Tara earned is:

1. For the hats:
   - Each hat needs 2 skeins of wool.
   - For 3 hats, she needs \(3 \times 2 = 6\) skeins of wool.

2. For the scarves:
   - Each scarf needs 4 skeins of wool.
   - For 3 scarves, she needs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) skeins of wool.

3. For the sweaters:
   - Each sweater needs 12 skeins of wool.
   - For 3 sweaters, she needs \(3 \times 12 = 36\) skeins of wool.

"To find out how much more Ada's electric bill will be after adding the new device, we need to calculate the difference in her weekly bill.

First, let's find out how much Ada's bill will be after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Weekly cost before: 12 kW/h * $1.50/kW/h * 7 days = $126

After adding the new device:
- New device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption: 12 kW/h + 2 kW/h = 14 kW/h
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Weekly cost after: 14 kW/h * $1.50/kW/h * 7 days = $147

Now, we find the difference between the two weekly costs:
- Difference: $147 - $126 = $21

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21.

The correct answer is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days.
2. So, in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is a quarter of a house.
3. Now, if we have 5 people working together, they can paint 5 times a quarter of a house in one day.
4. So, in one day, 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}\) of a house.
5. To paint a whole house, they need \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day because \(\frac{5}{4} \times \frac{4}{5} = 1\) (which means they paint a whole house).

Now, we need to convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we calculate:
\(\frac{4}{5} \times 24 = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house. The closest option to 19.2 hours is 19 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. The problem says Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Ophelia has 20 sofas, she must have 2 more chairs than sofas. That means:

\[ \text{Ophelia's chairs} = \text{Ophelia's sofas} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, if Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna must have:

\[ \text{Jenna's chairs} = 3 \times \text{Ophelia's chairs} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Jenna has 66 chairs, she must have:

\[ \text{Jenna's sofas} = \text{Jenna's chairs} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs they have together:

\[ \text{Total sofas} = \text{Ophelia's sofas} + \text{Jenna's sofas} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = \text{Ophelia's chairs} + \text{Jenna's chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is 172.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tom spent $48 in total. He bought a CD for $4. So, the money left for the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $48. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many CDs he could buy with $48:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ CDs} \]

If Tom bought the headphone set, he spent $48 - $4 = $44 on the headphone set. So, he could buy:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ CDs} \]

To find out how many more CDs he could have bought without the headphone set, we subtract the number of CDs he bought with the headphone set from the number of CDs he could have bought with the full $48:
\[ 12 - 11 = 1 \text{ CD} \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The correct answer is:

   - Now, the number of people on the bus is \(40 + 40 = 80\).

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 people get off the bus.
   - So, the number of people left on the bus is \(80 - 21 = 59\).
   - Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off. So, \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people get on.
   - Now, the number of people on the bus is \(59 + 7 = 66\).

So, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step as if I'm a person with primary school level education.

1. **Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will be 27 years old in 5 years.
   - So, to find out how old he is now, we subtract 5 years from 27.
   - \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).
   - Jame is now 22 years old.

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be 30 years old because \( 22 + 8 = 30 \).
   - The problem says his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - So, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).
   - This means his cousin is now 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

3. **Age Difference:**
   - Jame is 22 years old.
   - His cousin is 47 years old.
   - The difference in their ages is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

So, the age difference between Jame and his cousin is 25 years.

The correct answer is:
**B**"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
2. The computer cost $1,100.
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.
4. Now we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
5. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
6. So, the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
7. Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

So, one monitor cost $300.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 20 kids in total, and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 girls and 10 boys.
2. Each boy brought 60 seashells.
3. Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells the boys brought plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
4. First, we calculate how many seashells the boys brought in total:
   - Each boy brought 60 seashells.
   - There are 10 boys.
   - So, the total number of seashells the boys brought is \(10 \times 60 = 600\).
5. Now, we calculate how many seashells each girl brought:
   - Each girl brought 60 (like the boys) plus four times 60.
   - Four times 60 is \(4 \times 60 = 240\).
   - So, each girl brought \(60 + 240 = 300\) seashells.
6. To find out how many seashells all the girls brought, we multiply the number of seashells each girl brought by the number of girls:
   - Each girl brought 300 seashells.
   - There are 10 girls.
   - So, the total number of seashells the girls brought is \(10 \times 300 = 3000\).

Now, let's look at the question again. The question asks how many seashells each girl brought. From our calculation, we know each girl brought 300 seashells.

So, the correct answer is that each girl brought \(\boxed{300}\) seashells."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so we need to find out how old Alyana is.

1. Chenny's age: 10 years
2. Alyana's age is 4 years less than Chenny's age, so:
   \[
   \text{Alyana's age} = 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we need to find out how old Anne is.

3. Anne's age is 2 years more than Alyana's age, so:
   \[
   \text{Anne's age} = 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ years}

"Let's add up the thickness of the books step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 × 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add all these together:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm

First, add 31 mm and 50 mm:
31 mm + 50 mm = 81 mm

Next, add 45 mm to the result:
81 mm + 45 mm = 126 mm

Finally, add 62 mm to the result:
126 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm. The correct answer is C."

The correct answer is 18."
"To find out how much you paid, we first need to calculate the tip. The dinner bill is $50, and you want to add a 20% tip.

1. Calculate 20% of $50:
   - 20% is the same as 20 out of 100, which can be written as 20/100 or 0.20.
   - So, we multiply $50 by 0.20:
     \[
     50 \times 0.20 = 10
     \]
   - This means the tip is $10.

2. Now, add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount:
   - The original bill is $50, and the tip is $10.
   - So, the total amount is:
     \[
     50 + 10 = 60
     \]

Therefore, you ended up paying $60.

The correct answer is C."
"Let's break down the problem step by step as if you are a person with primary school level education.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount of $18 is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy gets $6 because:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21
     \]

3. **Spending $8:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8 from his total:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so we need to divide this amount by 30 to find out how much he needs to save each day.

\[ \text{Daily savings} = \frac{1125}{30} = 37.5 \]

But the problem says he saves twice as much in the second half as in the first half. So, let's say he saves \( x \) in the first half. Then in the second half, he saves \( 2x \).

The total savings in the first half is \( 15x \) (since there are 15 days in the first half).
The total savings in the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

So, the total savings for the month is \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

We know this total is $1125, so:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide 1125 by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, in the first half, he saves $25 each day. In the second half, he saves twice that amount, which is:
\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

Verna bought:
- 3 apples at $1.50 each
- 5 oranges at $0.80 each
- 6 peaches at $0.75 each

First, we calculate the cost of each type of fruit:
- Cost of apples = 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
- Cost of oranges = 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
- Cost of peaches = 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, we add up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, Verna received $7.00 in change.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Jeff and Brad are sharing 100 dollars. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. So, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total money they have is:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide 100 by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Now, to find out how much Jeff gets, we multiply Brad's amount by 4:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{80 dollars} \]

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The alphabet has 26 letters.
2. Elise writes the alphabet twice, so that's \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.
3. Then she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so that's 13 letters.
4. Now, she writes everything she has already written. She has written 52 letters twice, which is 104 letters, and then she adds the 13 letters she wrote for half the alphabet. So, that's \(104 + 13 = 117\) letters.
5. She then writes all the letters she has written so far again. So, she writes 117 letters twice, which is \(117 \times 2 = 234\) letters.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First two alphabets: 52 letters
- Half of the alphabet: 13 letters
- Everything she has written so far: 117 letters
- Everything she has written so far again: 234 letters

So, the total number of letters she has written is \(52 + 13 + 117 + 234 = 416\).

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each type of item costs:
- A notebook costs $1.50.
- A pen costs $0.25.
- A calculator costs $12.
- A geometry set costs $10.

Now, Daniel wants to buy:
- 5 notebooks.
- 2 pens.
- 1 calculator.
- 1 geometry set.

Let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:
- The cost for 5 notebooks is \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\).
- The cost for 2 pens is \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\).
- The cost for 1 calculator is \(1 \times 12 = 12\).
- The cost for 1 geometry set is \(1 \times 10 = 10\).

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. So, we need to calculate 10% of $20:
\[10\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.10 \times 20 = 2\]

"To find out how much money Antonella earned, we need to calculate the commission for the two parts of her sales.

First, let's look at the first $1000 of her sales. She gets a 30% commission on this amount.
- Commission for the first $1000: \(1000 \times 0.30 = 300\)

Next, we look at the sales over $1000. Antonella sold $2500 in total, so the amount over $1000 is:
- Amount over $1000: \(2500 - 1000 = 1500\)
- Commission for the amount over $1000: \(1500 \times 0.10 = 150\)

Now, we add the two commissions together to find the total commission:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in cold water:
- In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. The problem says it's 2 minutes more than twice the time in cold water. So, we calculate twice the time in cold water:
- Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- So, in warm water, it takes \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.
- In cold water, to swim 3 miles, it takes \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
- In warm water, to swim 3 miles, it takes \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have a bag of buttons with 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have two holes each, and the rest have four holes each.

First, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. We know there are 21 buttons in total, and 7 of them have two holes. So, the number of buttons with four holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes. Since there are 7 buttons with two holes each, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes. Since there are 14 buttons with four holes each, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes in all the buttons:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons is 70.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. So if the daily recommended cups is \( R \), Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.
2. Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.
3. Juan's doctor wants him to drink 4 cups a day, which is the daily recommended amount.
4. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from what he drinks now: \( 5R - 4 \).

Now, let's assume the daily recommended amount \( R \) is 8 cups. Then:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The great pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house. This means the sun starts 32 degrees above the ground when it is at the tip of the pyramid.

2. The sun moves 5 degrees up from the pyramid every hour. If it moves for 10 hours, it will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. So, after 10 hours, the sun will be 50 degrees higher than it was at the tip of the pyramid. Since the tip of the pyramid was 32 degrees above the ground, the sun will be:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in those 105 minutes. We know she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we convert the 105 minutes of reading time in the first week to pages:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages from the first week and the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches to eat. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, and Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. A third of 12 is 4 because:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. A quarter of 12 is 3 because:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, we add the sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate together:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

So, they ate 7 sandwiches in total. To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches they ate from the total number of sandwiches:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 5.

The correct answer is:
5 sandwiches left."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Shiloh is 44 years old now. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

We know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \( x \), then we can write the equation:
\[ 51 = 3x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{51}{3} = 17 \]

So, in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from 17:
\[ 17 - 7 = 10 \]

Therefore, the nephew is 10 years old now.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 each. So, that's $1.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of $1.00, which is $0.50 each. So, that's $0.50 + $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add all these amounts together:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

$5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total.

The correct answer is:
\boxed{D} (assuming D is the correct option for $9.00 in a multiple-choice question)"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

We know Richie scored 80 goals. The problem tells us that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from 80:
\[ 80 - 45 = 35 \]
So, Anna scored 35 goals.

The problem also says Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, to find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from 80:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]
So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Now, to find out how many goals all three teenagers scored together, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

So, all three teenagers scored a total of 175 goals.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
(Note: Since the problem does not provide multiple-choice options, I've just provided the final answer. If there were options, you would choose the one that matches 175.)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. To find out how much Mitchell made, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam said he made $63. To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend the same amount each day for 7 days. So, each day he spends $70 ÷ 7 = $10.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends money on wooden action figures. He spends $10 each day, and each wooden action figure costs $5. So, each day he buys $10 ÷ $5 = 2 wooden action figures. Over 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday), he buys 2 action figures/day × 4 days = 8 wooden action figures.

For Thursday to Sunday, he spends money on plastic action figures. He spends $10 each day, and each plastic action figure costs $2. So, each day he buys $10 ÷ $2 = 5 plastic action figures. Over 4 days (Thursday to Sunday), he buys 5 action figures/day × 4 days = 20 plastic action figures.

Now, to find out how many action figures he has in total, we add the wooden and plastic action figures together: 8 wooden + 20 plastic = 28 action figures.

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 28. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost to spay the kitten is $200.
2. The cost for 3 vaccines is $20 each, so that's 3 times $20, which is $60.
3. The kitten broke 4 vases, and each vase costs $12, so that's 4 times $12, which is $48.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[ \$200 + \$60 + \$48 = \$308 \]

So, the total cost for the kitten is $308. The correct answer is C."
"Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses every week. So, Ford lacks 65 - 40 = 25 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so Ford lacks 25 * 4 = 100 roses every month.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{A. 100} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account. She takes out $100 every month. We need to find out how much money is left after 2 years.

First, we need to know how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina takes out $100 each month, so in 24 months, she will take out:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she took out from the initial amount:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The food truck makes 10 sandwiches with 1 loaf of bread. Each loaf costs $3.00.
2. They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
3. They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

First, let's find out how much it costs to make one sandwich:
- Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
- Cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
- Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00
- Cost per sandwich = $33.00 ÷ 10 = $3.30

Next, let's find out how much they make from selling 10 sandwiches:
- They sell each sandwich for $7.00
- Total revenue from 10 sandwiches = 10 × $7.00 = $70.00

Now, let's find out the net profit:
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

So, their net profit is $37.00. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Kate has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box has 64 crayons. So, we need to find out how many crayons she has in total.

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, Kate wants to make crayon muffins. She melts 8 crayon pieces together to make one muffin. So, we need to find out how many muffins she can make.

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Kate can sell each muffin for $1.50. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin.

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Kate can make \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Michael.

First, we need to find out how big Michael's bedroom is. The bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, so we multiply these numbers to find the area:

\[ 18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we need to figure out how much it costs to replace the carpet. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, and there's also $2 per square foot for padding. So, the total cost for the new carpet and padding is:

\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \text{ dollars per square foot} \]

To find the total cost for the carpet and padding, we multiply the cost per square foot by the area of the bedroom:

\[ 14 \times 216 = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to remove the old carpet. The old carpet costs $4 per square foot, so:

\[ 4 \times 216 = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to calculate the cost to install the new carpet. The new carpet costs $34 per square foot, so:

\[ 34 \times 216 = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 3024 + 864 + 7344 = 11232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11232. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct option in a multiple-choice question format.)"
"To find out how many birds Mack saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up all the birds:
- On days 1 and 2, he saw 50 birds.
- On day 3, he saw 0 birds.
- On days 4 and 5, he saw 120 birds.
- On day 6, he saw 20 birds.
- On day 7, he saw 90 birds.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
50 (day 1) + 50 (day 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7) = 280 birds

Next, we need to find out how many days there are in total. Mack counted birds over 7 days.

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average:
280 birds ÷ 7 days = 40 birds per day

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds each day. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Diane starts with a number 20. First, she adds half of 20 to 20. Half of 20 is 10, so she adds 10 to 20, which makes it 30.

Next, she divides 30 by 5. So, 30 divided by 5 is 6.

Finally, she takes the number she got (which is 6) and multiplies it by the number she started with minus 12. The number she started with is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Now she multiplies 6 by 8, which gives her 48.

So, the final value of the number train is 48. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many cards the boy and his brother have together, we can do the following:

1. The boy has 5 cards.
2. The brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so the brother has \(5 - 3 = 2\) cards.
3. To find out how many cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has: \(5 + 2 = 7\).

So, together they have 7 cards. The correct answer is C."
"To find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees when the oven is off by 4%, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out what temperature the oven should be set to so that the actual temperature is 520 degrees. We know that the oven is off by 4%, which means the actual temperature is 96% of the set temperature.

2. Let's say the set temperature is \( x \). The actual temperature will be 96% of \( x \), which is \( 0.96x \).

3. We know the actual temperature should be 520 degrees, so we set up the equation:
   \[ 0.96x = 520 \]

4. To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.96:
   \[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} \]

5. Now, let's do the division:
   \[ x = 541.67 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 541.67 degrees to get 520 degrees as the actual temperature.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{541.67} \]"
"To find out how many minutes Max will spend watching the movies, we need to add the time of the first movie to the time of the second movie.

First movie: 1 hour and 30 minutes
1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Second movie: 2 hours and 5 minutes
2 hours is 2 × 60 = 120 minutes, so 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the two times together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

So, Max will spend 215 minutes watching the two movies. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. First, we know Herb's house is worth $76,000.
2. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. To find out how much less, we calculate 30% of $76,000:
   - 30% of $76,000 = 0.30 × $76,000 = $22,800.
3. So, Juan's house is $22,800 less than $76,000.
   - Value of Juan's house = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.
4. Now, to find the combined value of both houses, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house:
   - Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

So, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Judy bought 12 cups and twice as many dishes as cups. So, she bought 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy's friend brought. So, her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the cups and dishes:

Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 60

Total cups: 12 + 40 = 52
Total dishes: 24 + 60 = 84

Total utensils: 52 cups + 84 dishes = 136 utensils

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 136.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{136} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that one box of contacts costs $100.00 but is 10% off. So, the discount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

After the discount, one box costs:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

If Pete uses one pair of contacts per day, 180 contacts will last for:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ days} \]

But we need to find the cost per pair of contacts. Since the total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00 and there are 180 contacts, the cost per pair is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is $1.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{A} \] (Assuming A is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question, which is not provided in the original question but is included here for the sake of the multiple-choice format.)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday

So, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much money each person earned. They both earn $10 for each hour they work.

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings.

Difference = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The correct answer is:

C. $40"
"Hannah burns calories while doing aerobics and running. Let's break it down:

1. She does aerobics for 2 hours, and each hour burns 500 calories. So, for 2 hours, she burns:
   \[
   2 \times 500 = 1000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. She also runs for 1 hour, and running burns 600 calories in 1 hour. So, for 1 hour, she burns:
   \[
   1 \times 600 = 600 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
   \[
   1000 + 600 = 1600 \text{ calories}
   \]

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, for 1600 calories, she needs:
   \[
   \frac{1600}{200} \times 100 = 8 \times 100 = 800 \text{ ml}
   \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water. The correct answer is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500. The note says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

First, let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

For red jelly beans:
- 1% fewer than blue jelly beans means \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \).

For green jelly beans:
- 1% more than blue jelly beans means \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substitute \( R \) and \( G \) with their expressions in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Now, solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we know the number of blue jelly beans is 1500.

Next, find the number of red jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]

And the number of green jelly beans:
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Jared's typing speed starts at 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, it increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words per minute, his new speed will be 57 WPM.

Now, we need to find the average of these three speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

First, we add these three speeds together:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Next, we divide the total by 3 to find the average:
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"To find out the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate how much weight he gains or loses in each case and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how much weight Martin loses if he eats Cheerios every day:
- He loses 1.25 pounds each week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
  \[
  1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate how much weight Martin gains if he eats donuts every day:
- He gains 1.75 pounds each week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:
  \[
  1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, to find out how much more weight Martin gains compared to losing, we subtract the weight loss from the weight gain:
\[
8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds. The correct answer is:

\boxed{B} (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, which is not provided in the original question but is included here for the sake of following the multiple-choice format requirement.)"
"Let's count the total number of seats Alex needs step by step.

1. Alex invites 100 people.
2. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends. So, \(100 \times 2 = 200\) friends are invited.
3. Alex calls 10 of her friends. Out of these 10 friends, 8 bring their spouses. So, 8 more people will come.

Now, let's add all these up:
- Alex herself: 1
- 100 people she invited: 100
- 200 friends invited by the 100 people: 200
- 8 people who bring their spouses: 8

So, the total number of people coming is \(1 + 100 + 200 + 8 = 309\).

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm a primary school student.

1. The first dog is an Affenpinscher and weighs 10 pounds.
2. The second dog is a Dachshund and weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. So, the Dachshund weighs \(10 \times 2 = 20\) pounds.
3. The third dog is a Papillon and weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. So, the Papillon weighs \(20 \div 4 = 5\) pounds.
4. The fourth dog is a Mastiff and weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the Mastiff weighs \(5 \times 44 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost for eBay.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping is $4, so the total cost is:
\[ 16 + 4 = 20 \]

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so the shipping cost is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]
So, the total cost on eBay is:
\[ 13 + 8 = 21 \]

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
\[ 21 - 20 = 1 \]

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, which is not provided in the original question but is included here for the sake of following the multiple-choice format requirement.)"

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. We need to find out how many grams of protein John gets in a week.

1. Calculate the protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:
   - 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein.
   - So, 200 grams of mushrooms will have twice as much protein because 200 is twice 100.
   - Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms have \(3 \times 2 = 6\) grams of protein.

2. Now, we need to find out how much protein John gets in a week:
   - John eats 6 grams of protein every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, in a week, John gets \(6 \times 7 = 42\) grams of protein.

The number of grams of protein John gets per week is 42 grams.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, if we let Jerry's current age be \( J \), then 5 years ago he was \( J - 5 \) years old. According to the problem, his current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

To find \( J \), we need to get all the \( J \) terms on one side:

\[ J - 2J = -10 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ -J = -10 \]

So, if we multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

This means Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. The correct answer is:

C (assuming C is the correct option for 13 in a multiple-choice format)"
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to know how much more money he needs after his deposit. The total cost of the dental work is $4500, and he has already put down a $600 deposit. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The correct answer is:

B. 260 hours"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle \( x \). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's \( 2x \). Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's \( 3x \).

So, we have:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining the \( x \)'s, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. The correct answer is:

C (assuming C is the correct option for 90 degrees in a multiple-choice format)"
"Colby has different types of coins. Let's count how much money he has in total.

- He has 8 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 8 quarters are worth 8 * 25 = 200 cents.
- He has 6 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes are worth 6 * 10 = 60 cents.
- He has 14 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 14 nickels are worth 14 * 5 = 70 cents.
- He has 15 pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so 15 pennies are worth 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents.

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs. The correct answer is C."
"To find out the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to count the legs of each type of pet and then add them up.

- Each dog has 4 legs, and there are 5 dogs, so 5 dogs × 4 legs = 20 legs.
- Each cat has 4 legs, and there are 2 cats, so 2 cats × 4 legs = 8 legs.
- Each bird has 2 legs, and there are 10 birds, so 10 birds × 2 legs = 20 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
20 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from cats) + 20 legs (from birds) = 48 legs.

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48. The correct answer is C."
"Jamaal started with an 8-pound weight. He increased it by 50%, so he added 50% of 8 pounds to the 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 is 4 pounds, so he added 4 pounds to the 8 pounds, making it 12 pounds.

But it turned out to be too heavy, so he used a weight that was 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. 

12 pounds minus 2 pounds is 10 pounds.

So, the weight he now uses is 10 pounds.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's count the games year by year in a simple way.

**Year 1:**
- Steve starts with 5 games.
- He buys 1 game each month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
- Total games after Year 1: 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) = 17 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after Year 1 (including Christmas): 17 + 5 = 22 games.

**Year 2:**
- Steve starts with 22 games.
- He buys 2 games each month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
- Total games after Year 2: 22 (from Year 1) + 24 (bought) = 46 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after Year 2 (including Christmas): 46 + 5 = 51 games.

**Year 3:**
- Steve starts with 51 games.
- He buys 4 games each month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
- Total games after Year 3: 51 (from Year 2) + 48 (bought) = 99 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after Year 3 (including Christmas): 99 + 5 = 104 games.

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games. The correct answer is:

\boxed{104}"
"To find out how many hours it takes to travel 2000 miles at the same speed, we first need to know how fast the plane is traveling. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so we can calculate the speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, to find out how many hours it takes to travel 2000 miles at 400 miles per hour, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles. The correct answer is:

B"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, in 1 hour, Ruiz makes half of that, which is:
\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) as much as Ruiz in one hour. So, we calculate:
\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Ruiz works for 12 hours, so he makes:
\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa also works for 12 hours, so she makes:
\[ 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find the total amount of chocolates they make together, we add the amounts Ruiz and Marissa make:
\[ 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260 pounds. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from his original amount:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

So, Howard has $12 left. The correct answer is:

\boxed{12}"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Patrick sold lemonade for 6 hours. We need to find out how much money he made.

First, for the first 4 hours:
- He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup cost $0.50.

So, for 4 hours, he sold:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]
And the money he made from these cups is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30.00 \]

Next, for the next 2 hours:
- He sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup cost $0.60.

So, for 2 hours, he sold:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]
And the money he made from these cups is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12.00 \]

Now, we add the money he made from both parts:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, Patrick made \$42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours. The correct answer is:

C. \$42.00"
"To find out how many years Jeremy's tires need to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many rotations the tires make in a month. The car rotates 725 times for every 2 miles. So, for 400 miles, we calculate the rotations as follows:
   - 400 miles / 2 miles = 200 (this means the car goes 200 times through the 2-mile cycle)
   - 200 times * 725 rotations = 145,000 rotations per month

2. Now, we know each tire can go up to 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total rotations by the number of rotations per month:
   - 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months

3. Since there are 12 months in a year, we divide the number of months by 12 to find out how many years it takes:
   - 72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have a bottle of shampoo that costs $24.00.
2. The bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps.
3. Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.

First, we need to find out how many washes 1 pump gives:
- 2 pumps give 120 washes.
- So, 1 pump gives:
  \[
  \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
  \]

Now, we know Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, so:
- 1 pump gives 60 washes.
- The bottle costs $24.00, and it gives 120 washes.

To find out how much 1 pump costs, we need to see how many pumps are in the bottle:
- The bottle gives 120 washes, and 1 pump gives 60 washes.
- So, the bottle has:
  \[
  \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps}
  \]

Now, we know the bottle costs $24.00 and it has 2 pumps:
- So, 1 pump costs:
  \[
  \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump}
  \]

To convert dollars to cents:
- 1 dollar = 100 cents.
- So, 12.00 dollars is:
  \[
  12.00 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
  \]

Therefore, each pump costs 1200 cents. The correct answer is:

"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out cost $35. 

First, we need to find out how much the shirt and shorts cost after the discount. The shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount, so the discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt after the discount is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts are $35, and there is a 30% discount, so the discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
So, the shorts after the discount are:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, Joe will have $8.00 left after the purchase. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming the multiple-choice options were provided as A. $6.00, B. $8.00, C. $10.00, D. $12.00)"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs, we can follow these steps:

1. We know that 1 dozen croissants need 1/4 pound of butter.
2. Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day.
3. So, for 4 dozen croissants, the butter needed is:
   \[
   4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound}
   \]
4. Since Juan wants to make these croissants for a week (7 days), the total butter needed is:
   \[
   1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost for each street.

Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter to repave. So, the cost for Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars} \]

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 per meter to repave. So, the cost for Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 94860 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ 94860 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65760 \text{ dollars} \]

So, it costs $65760 more to repave Lewis' street. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

John got $100,000 to start his research for the first 5 months. After that, his research took longer than expected. It took 10 times as long as the first 5 months, so that's 10 times 5 months, which is 50 months in total.

The first 5 months were already covered by the $100,000, so he needed more money for the rest. The rest is 50 months minus the first 5 months, which is 45 months.

For the last 45 months, each month cost more money. Each month after the first 5 months cost 50% more than the first 5 months. The first 5 months cost $20,000 each month ($100,000 divided by 5 months). So, 50% more than $20,000 is $20,000 plus $10,000, which is $30,000 per month.

Now, for 45 months at $30,000 each, the total cost is 45 times $30,000, which is $1,350,000.

So, the total cost of the research is $100,000 (for the first 5 months) plus $1,350,000 (for the next 45 months), which is $1,450,000.

The correct answer is C."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each tip is 1 ounce. So, 8 tips are 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, we add up all the meat they ate:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

So, the total is:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, for the remaining four days, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

For the four days, it pulled:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we add the cars pulled in the first three days to the cars pulled in the last four days:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is 54. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"Adam needs to grow 4 feet to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. He is currently 3.33 feet tall. So, he needs to grow 4 - 3.33 = 0.67 feet more. Since he grows 2 inches (which is 2/12 feet) each year, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to grow 0.67 feet.

If he grows 2/12 feet each year, we can calculate the number of years it will take for him to grow 0.67 feet by dividing 0.67 by 2/12:

\[ \text{Years} = \frac{0.67}{2/12} = \frac{0.67 \times 12}{2} = \frac{8.04}{2} = 4.02 \]

Since Adam can't grow for a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number. So, it will take him 4 years to grow enough to ride the roller coaster.

The correct answer is A. 4 years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. So, the total cost of the cars is:
\[ 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of that price to get the cars, so the company paid:
\[ 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

The profit James made is the total cost minus what the company paid:
\[ \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is:
\[ 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, James made:
\[ \$17,500 \]

The correct answer is:
A. \$17,500"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 100 surfers in total.
2. When a big wave comes, only 25% of the surfers can stay on the wave without falling.
3. So, we need to find out how many surfers can stay on the wave. That's 25% of 100, which is:
   \[
   100 \times 0.25 = 25
   \]
   So, 25 surfers can stay on the wave.
4. Out of these 25 surfers, 60% are women. To find out how many women there are, we calculate:
   \[
   25 \times 0.60 = 15
   \]
   So, 15 women can stay on the wave.
5. The rest of the surfers are men. To find out how many men there are, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who can stay on the wave:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 men can stay on the wave.

Therefore, the number of men who can stay on the wave is 10.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, we calculate the price of the gold jewel:

\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ dollars} \]

The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we calculate the price of the silver jewel:

\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the prices of all three jewels to find the total price:

\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800. The correct answer is:

C. $4800"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \]
truck stamps.

He also bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]
rose stamps.

Now, to find out how many stamps he bought in total, we add up all the stamps:
\[ 16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45 \]

So, Max bought a total of 45 stamps. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to figure out how fast Tom is closing the gap and then see how long it takes him to close 75 miles.

Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. So, Tom is catching up to Bob at a rate of 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

Now, we know the gap is 75 miles, and Tom is closing this gap at 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the speed at which Tom is closing the gap:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The correct answer is:

B. 5"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so we subtract 6 from 17:
   \[
   17 - 6 = 11
   \]
   So, Darren caught 11 fish.
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to 11:
   \[
   11 + 3 = 14
   \]
   So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is 14. The correct answer is:

\boxed{14}"
"Let's think about this step by step.

Manny is taking 10 karate classes. His parents will not sign him up for more classes if each class costs more than $10. Manny's total cost for all classes is $60.

First, we need to find out how much each class costs if there are 10 classes in total. We do this by dividing the total cost by the number of classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Each class costs $6, which is less than $10. So, Manny's parents will not sign him up again because each class is not more than $10.

Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class goes over $10. Since each class costs $6, he can miss as many classes as long as the cost per class stays at $6. If he misses 4 classes, he will have 6 classes left. The cost per class then becomes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

If he misses 5 classes, he will have 5 classes left. The cost per class then becomes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Since 12 is more than $10, Manny's parents will not sign him up again if he misses 5 or more classes.

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers a day. Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so Julie processes \(50 \times 2 = 100\) customers a day.

Now, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

So, Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers in a week.
And Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers in a week.

To find the total number of customers they process in a week, we add the number of customers Jewel processes to the number of customers Julie processes:
\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Reggie also ran 3 miles more than Lynn. So, if we let the number of miles Lynn ran be \( L \), then:
\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 from 20:
\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much one apple costs. If 4 apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we need to find out how much one orange costs. If 3 oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples cost:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
So, 5 apples cost $6.50.

And how much 5 oranges cost:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]
So, 5 oranges cost $5.50.

To find the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question format.)"
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The hole is shaped like a rectangular box, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

The length of the hole is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 3 feet. So, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to dig one cubic foot of earth. So, to find out how long it will take him to dig 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to dig one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the total cost of Bill's new truck.

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
3. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500
   \]
4. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]
5. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
\]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

The correct answer is B. $43,500."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Tim makes each month after his raise and bonus. His original salary is $20,000 a month. He gets a 5% raise, so we calculate the raise amount:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } 20,000 = 0.05 \times 20,000 = 1,000 \]

So, his new salary after the raise is:

\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

Next, he gets a bonus that is half of his new salary:

\[ \frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500 \]

Now, we add the bonus to his new salary to find out his total monthly income:

\[ 21,000 + 10,500 = 31,500 \]

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ 31,500 \times 12 = 378,000 \]

So, Tim will make $378,000 in a year. The correct answer is:

C. $378,000"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James buys:
- 10 suits, each costing $750.
- 10 pairs of dress pants, each costing $150 (which is 1/5 of $750).
- 3 dress shirts per suit, so 10 suits mean 30 dress shirts, each costing $60.

First, let's find out how much the suits cost:
- 10 suits × $750 per suit = $7500

Next, let's find out how much the dress pants cost:
- 10 pairs × $150 per pair = $1500

Now, let's find out how much the dress shirts cost:
- 30 shirts × $60 per shirt = $1800

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of suits: $7500
- Cost of dress pants: $1500
- Cost of dress shirts: $1800

Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800

So, the total cost is $10800. The correct answer is C."
"To find out the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, let's calculate how many articles the news website publishes in February. The news website publishes 20 articles every day, and February has 28 days. So, we multiply 20 by 28:
\[ 20 \times 28 = 560 \]
The news website publishes 560 articles in February.

Next, let's calculate how many articles the sister company publishes in February. The sister company publishes 10 articles every day, and February also has 28 days. So, we multiply 10 by 28:
\[ 10 \times 28 = 280 \]
The sister company publishes 280 articles in February.

Now, to find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we add the number of articles from both websites:
\[ 560 + 280 = 840 \]

So, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840.

The correct answer is:

"To find out how much flour was in three bags before it was divided, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that one bag is divided into 8 portions, and each portion weighs 2 kilograms.
2. So, to find out how much one bag weighs, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion:
   \[
   8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms}
   \]
   This means one bag weighs 16 kilograms.
3. Now, to find out how much three bags weigh, we multiply the weight of one bag by 3:
   \[
   16 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 = 48 \text{ kilograms}

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate how far Alisa biked:
- Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- So, Alisa's distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

Next, let's calculate how far Stanley biked:
- Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- So, Stanley's distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
- Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance
- Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

The correct answer is C."
"To find out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time for each part of the digging separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet of soil in 1 hour.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- So, the time to dig through the soil is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, so he digs 2 feet of clay in 1 hour.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- So, the time to dig through the clay is \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we add the time for both parts:
- Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well. The correct answer is C."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the total cost was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]
Then, she got a $2 discount, so the cost was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

On Wednesday, the price of each pomegranate was $30. So, for 20 pomegranates, the cost would be:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]
But there was a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
So, the cost after the discount was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, to find out how much more Sheila paid than Clara, we subtract Clara's cost from Sheila's cost:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ariadne sold red hats for $400. This is half the amount she sold green hats for. So, if $400 is half, then she sold green hats for $800.

In the first month, she made $400 from red hats and $800 from green hats, so she made a total of $400 + $800 = $1200.

In the second month, she made 3/4 of what she made in the first month. So, she made 3/4 of $1200, which is $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

Now, to find out how much she made in two months, we add the money she made in the first month and the second month together. So, $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The total amount she made in two months is $2100."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James hires a carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. He gets 1 hour for free. So, he pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. The second hour costs twice as much as the first hour, so it's $15 * 2 = $30. The third hour costs twice as much as the second hour, so it's $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we add up the cost of the first, second, and third hours:
$15 + $30 + $60 = $105

So, James paid $105 for the carriage. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate how much money Sally earned this week. She started with $200 in her bank account and now it's $420. So, she earned $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

2. Sally's weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract her weekly wage from the total amount she earned. So, $220 - $300 = -$80.

Since the result is negative, it means $80 was withheld from her wage. Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80.

The correct answer is:

"Mike's teacher gave him a homework to read a 200-page book. Mike plans to read 10 pages every day. We need to find out how many days it will take him to finish reading the book.

First, we calculate how many days it will take Mike to read all 200 pages if he reads 10 pages each day:
\[
\text{Total pages} = 200
\]
\[
\text{Pages per day} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we know the homework is due in 30 days. To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish from the deadline:
\[
\text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days}
\]
\[
\text{Days required} = 20 \text{ days}
\]
\[
\text{Days before deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days}

"To find out how much James spent on his plane for the first year, we need to add the cost of the plane to the cost of renting the hanger and fuel for a whole year.

First, let's calculate the cost of renting the hanger for a year:
- James pays $5000 a month for the hanger.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- So, the cost for the hanger for a year is $5000 * 12 = $60000.

Next, let's calculate the cost of fuel for a year:
- James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on renting the hanger.
- So, he spends $5000 * 2 = $10000 a month on fuel.
- The cost for fuel for a year is $10000 * 12 = $120000.

Now, we add the cost of the plane to the total cost for renting the hanger and fuel for a year:
- The plane costs $150000.
- The total cost for renting the hanger and fuel for a year is $60000 + $120000 = $180000.
- So, the total cost for the first year is $150000 + $180000 = $330000.

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330000.

The correct answer is C."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Finley cooked rice first. It took her 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, the time to cook pork is 30 minutes (for rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
3. The time to cook beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined time for pork and rice is 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes. So, the time to cook beans is half of 80 minutes, which is 80 minutes ÷ 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add up the time for all the food:
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of each part of the mixtures:

1. For the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
   - The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
   - The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
   - So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

2. For the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
   - The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
   - So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 3 dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
- The total number of heads is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

First, let's think about the heads. If there are 20 heads, that means there are 20 animals in total (sheep and geese).

Now, let's think about the legs. If all 20 animals were sheep, they would have 20 sheep * 4 legs = 80 legs. But we only have 70 legs, so not all animals are sheep.

Let's see how many sheep we can have if we have some geese. If we have 15 sheep, they would have 15 sheep * 4 legs = 60 legs. We need 10 more legs to make it 70 legs. Since each goose has 2 legs, we need 10 geese to get the extra 10 legs.

So, if we have 15 sheep and 5 geese, that makes 20 animals in total and 70 legs in total.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The correct answer is A. 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Roger buys coffee that costs $5 per pound.
2. He needs to buy more expensive coffee that costs 20% more than the normal coffee. So, the more expensive coffee costs $5 + (20% of $5) = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.
3. Roger needs to buy coffee for a week, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. So, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.
4. The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is 7 pounds * $6/pound = $42.
5. Roger also buys a donut for $2.
6. The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

So, the total cost is $44. The correct answer is C."
"Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the chips, the chicken, and the soda:
- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: \(2 \times 2.00 = 4.00\)
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00\]

Gus spent a total of $20.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\]

So, the apple pie cost $7.00.

The correct answer is:
**C. 7.00**"
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600.

The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198.

The number of newspapers delivered to District C is 209.

So, we need to calculate:

\[ 600 - (198 + 209) \]

First, add the newspapers delivered to District A and District C:

\[ 198 + 209 = 407 \]

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of newspapers:

\[ 600 - 407 = 193 \]

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The correct answer is 193."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John goes to a cooking class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. The class lasts for 6 weeks. We need to find out how many recipes John learns if he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

First, let's find out how many hours John spends in class in total.

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- The class lasts for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of class hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ classes/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class hours by the number of hours per recipe:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{B}
\]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We have 150 teachers on the basketball court. Out of these, 60% are history teachers. To find out how many history teachers there are, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 150 = \frac{60}{100} \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find out how many math teachers there are, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours all the math teachers sleep in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{360}

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Aurelia has $120 and Kassidy has 3/4 of what Aurelia has. So, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
   \[
   \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we calculate Rayna's money as follows:
   \[
   \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Now, we add up the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. If they decide to share the money equally, each person will get:
   \[

"To find out how long the game lasted, we need to add up the time for all the quarters.

1. Each quarter is 12 minutes long.
2. There are 4 quarters in total.
3. In the last quarter, the game was extended by 5 minutes.

First, we calculate the time for the first three quarters:
\[ 3 \text{ quarters} \times 12 \text{ minutes per quarter} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the time for the fourth quarter, which includes the 5-minute extension:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 17 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for the first three quarters and the time for the fourth quarter:
\[ 36 \text{ minutes} + 17 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the entire game lasted 53 minutes. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. We have 50 employees in the company.
2. 20% of these employees are management. To find out how many that is, we calculate 20% of 50:
   \[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]
   So, there are 10 management employees.
3. Out of these 10 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company. To find out how many of these 10 management employees oversee the company, we calculate 30% of 10:
   \[ 30\% \text{ of } 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]
   So, 3 employees oversee the company.

The number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, we first need to know how much she needs for one muffin. For one muffin, she needs:

- 5 tablespoons of flour
- 3 tablespoons of sugar
- 0.25 tablespoons of salt

So, for one muffin, she needs:
\[ 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Now, to find out how much she needs for 16 muffins, we multiply 8.25 tablespoons by 16:
\[ 8.25 \times 16 = 132 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Svetlana needs 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Adam bought 7 candies of type A, and each costs $0.5. So, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \]

He also bought 10 candies of type B, and each costs $0.75. So, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \]

Adam paid $15 to the cashier. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

"Let's break it down step by step:

Christina recorded her mood for 30 days. We know:
- She had 12 good days.
- She had 8 bad days.
- The rest were neutral days.

First, we need to find out how many neutral days there were:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 12 \text{ good days} - 8 \text{ bad days} = 10 \text{ neutral days} \]

Next, we look at how the days were distributed:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The last 8 days were neutral.

We also know the next three days:
- Day 29: Good
- Day 30: Neutral
- Day 31: Good

Now, let's count the good days again:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 3 days: 1 good day (Day 29) + 1 good day (Day 31) = 2 good days

Adding these up:
\[ 8 \text{ (first 8 days)} + 2 \text{ (next 3 days)} = 10 \text{ good days} \]

Christina had 12 good days in total. So, the number of good days left is:
\[ 12 \text{ (total good days)} - 10 \text{ (good days recorded)} = 2 \text{ good days left} \]

So, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Janey has 21 books. The problem says Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. We need to find out how many books Sally has.

Let's say Sally has \( S \) books. Then twice the number of books Sally has is \( 2S \). And 3 more than that is \( 2S + 3 \).

We know that \( 2S + 3 = 21 \).

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

First, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We know the bamboo grows 30 inches every day. It is currently 20 feet tall. First, we need to change 20 feet into inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we want to know how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches. The bamboo is already 240 inches tall, so it needs to grow:

\[ 600 - 240 = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches each day, we divide the total inches it needs to grow by how much it grows each day:

\[ 360 \div 30 = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches. The correct answer is:

**B. 12**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. He needs 8 more toys for 8 more dogs he sees in the shelter.
3. After buying the toys, he sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. So, there are now 8 more dogs, making a total of 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs.
4. He needs 1 toy for each of the 12 dogs, so he needs 12 toys now.
5. When he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he only needs toys for 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.
6. He needs 1 toy for each of the 9 dogs, so he needs 9 toys now.

Now, let's add up all the toys he needs:
- Initially, he needed 8 toys.
- After buying the toys, he needed 12 toys.
- When he came back again, he needed 9 toys.

So, the total number of toys he needs is 8 + 12 + 9 = 29 toys.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, just like in a primary school.

1. **Total Investment**: The total amount invested is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment**: Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]
   So, Dylan invested $480.

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan**: After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]
   So, $720 is left.

4. **Frances's Investment**: Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480

   So, Frances invested $480.

5. **Remaining Amount After Frances**: After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   720 - 480 = 240

"To find out how much the total weight exceeds the elevator's maximum load, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, let's add up the weight of Jack and the 8 other adults:
- Jack weighs 80 kg.
- Each of the 8 other adults weighs 80 kg, so together they weigh \( 8 \times 80 \) kg.

Let's calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Now, add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 80 \text{ kg} + 640 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The elevator can only hold 700 kg. To find out how much they exceed the limit, we subtract the elevator's maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. The problem tells us that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to 68. 

\[ 68 + 5 = 73 \]

So, Max has 73 cookies.

Next, the problem says Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. To find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, we subtract 12 from 73.

\[ 73 - 12 = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Now, the problem says Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find out how many cookies Summer has, we add 23 to 73.

\[ 73 + 23 = 96 \]

So, Summer has 96 cookies.

Now, to find out how many cookies they all have in total, we add up the cookies each person has:

\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]

"Shania made her dress longer by adding 50% of its original length and then added 20 cm at the bottom. The final dress is 140 cm long. To find out how long the dress was originally, we need to work backwards.

First, let's say the original length of the dress was \( x \) cm. When Shania added 50% of the original length, she added \( 0.5x \) cm. Then she added 20 cm at the bottom. So the total length is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{A} \]

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's say the age of one triplet is 6 years. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the twin's age would be 6 + 7 = 13 years.

Now, we know the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. So, if we have one triplet who is 6 years old and one twin who is 13 years old, their combined age is 6 + 13 = 19 years.

Since there are two triplets and two twins, we need to add the ages of the other triplet and the other twin. So, we have 19 (from the first triplet and twin) + 6 (from the second triplet) + 13 (from the second twin) = 38 years.

But we need the total to be 44 years. So, we need to add 44 - 38 = 6 more years to our total. This means the second triplet is also 6 years old, and the second twin is 13 years old.

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step as if I'm a person with primary school level education.

We know Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. First, let's find out how much four candies cost.

If each lollipop costs $0.40, then five lollipops cost:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we need to find out how much one candy costs. Since four candies cost $1.20, one candy costs:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we want to know how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. We already know that one lollipop costs $0.40, so 10 lollipops cost:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And we found that one candy costs $0.30, so 10 candies cost:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $7.00. The correct answer is:

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves a bit more coins than Rong. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong every month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many coins they save in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

So, the total number of coins they save together in 10 years is:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill. Let's say the total bill is \( T \). So, the heartworm check costs:
\[ 0.6 \times T \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, let's move \( 0.6 \times T \) to the left side:
\[ T - 0.6 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4 \times T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the price of the crate of fruit.

First, we need to know how much each type of fruit costs:
- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as one apple, so one banana costs $0.5 * 2 = $1.0.
- One orange costs three times as much as one banana, so one orange costs $1.0 * 3 = $3.0.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate has 5 bananas, so the cost for bananas is 5 * $1.0 = $5.0.
- The crate has 12 apples, so the cost for apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.0.
- The crate has 7 oranges, so the cost for oranges is 7 * $3.0 = $21.0.

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits to get the total cost of the crate:
- Total cost = cost of bananas + cost of apples + cost of oranges
- Total cost = $5.0 + $6.0 + $21.0 = $32.0

So, the price for the crate of fruit is $32.0. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many square feet Brittany's comforter is, we need to count all the squares of different colors and then add them up.

First, we know there are 14 red squares.

Next, we find out how many blue squares there are. The problem says there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, we add 4 to the number of red squares:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]
So, there are 18 blue squares.

Now, we find out how many green squares there are. The problem says there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we add 6 to the number of blue squares:
\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \]
So, there are 24 green squares.

Finally, we find out how many white squares there are. The problem says there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, we subtract 12 from the number of green squares:
\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \]
So, there are 12 white squares.

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[ 14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \text{ squares} \]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square has an area of 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
\[ 68 \text{ square feet} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function. So, the total number of people is:
\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

The restaurant has 8 high chairs. It also has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we add the regular chairs and the high chairs to find out how many chairs are there in total:
\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

We need to find out how many more chairs are needed to have enough for all 57 people. So, we subtract the number of chairs the restaurant has from the total number of people:
\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. We have 50 deer in the field.
2. 50 percent of them are bucks. To find out how many bucks there are, we calculate 50 percent of 50:
   \[ 50\% \times 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]
   So, there are 25 bucks.
3. Now, 20 percent of these bucks are 8 points. To find out how many bucks are 8 points, we calculate 20 percent of 25:
   \[ 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]
   So, there are 5 bucks that are 8 points.

The number of 8 point bucks is 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Adam has collected 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find out how many points Betty collected, we calculate:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \]
So, Betty collected:
\[ 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points} \]

Next, Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points, so:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add up all the points collected by Adam, Betty, Marta, and Tom:
\[ 50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235 \text{ points} \]

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. To find out how many points they are missing, we subtract the points they have from the total needed:
\[ 400 - 235 = 165 \text{ points} \]

So, the class is missing \(\boxed{165}\) points to go on the trip."
"Great Grandma Jones has three children. Each of her children has three grandchildren. And each of those grandchildren has three great grand-babies. To find out how many great grand-babies there are, we need to multiply the number of children by the number of grandchildren each has, and then by the number of great grand-babies each grandchild has.

So, we do:
3 (children) × 3 (grandchildren per child) × 3 (great grand-babies per grandchild) = 27 great grand-babies.

The number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27.

The correct answer is C. 27."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. So, she puts:
\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]
into her retirement account.

After putting money into her retirement account, she has:
\[ 2400 - 1200 = 1200 \]
left.

Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. So, she uses:
\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]
for her car payment.

After paying for her car, she has:
\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]
left to spend.

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720.00.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

We know the box can hold 20 pencils, but 4 pencils are missing. So, we need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box now.

If 4 pencils are missing from 20, we can find out how many pencils are left by subtracting 4 from 20:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils there are. Since each pair has 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils left by 2:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many fireworks are in the display. The city is setting off 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks. So, we multiply 15 by 20:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300
   \]
   So, there are 300 fireworks in total.

2. Hannah can see 40% of these fireworks from her house. To find out how many fireworks she can see, we calculate 40% of 300:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.40 \times 300 = 120
   \]
   So, Hannah can see 120 fireworks from her house.

3. Hannah also sets off 3 boxes of fireworks in her backyard. Each box has 5 fireworks, so we multiply 3 by 5:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
   So, Hannah sets off 15 fireworks in her backyard.

4. To find out the total number of fireworks Hannah sees, we add the fireworks she sees from the display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:
   \[
   120 + 15 = 135

- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

So, the total number of drinks and snacks needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times (1 \text{ seat} + 2 \text{ drinks} + 3 \text{ snacks}) = 20 \times 6 = 120 \]

Each drink and each snack costs $2. So, the total cost for the drinks and snacks is:

\[ 120 \text{ items} \times 2 \text{ dollars per item} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the group has spent a total of $240 on drinks and snacks. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so we add 800 to 4,000 to find out how much Gordy's truck can carry.

\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know the total capacity of all three trucks together is 11,600 pounds. We already know Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. So, we need to find out how much Gary's truck can carry by subtracting the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity.

\[ 11600 - (4000 + 4800) = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Larry cooked dumplings for his friends. There are 8 men, and Larry is one of them. So, there are 7 other men. There are also 6 women.

Each woman ate 3 dumplings. So, the 6 women ate:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Each man ate 1 more dumpling than each woman. Since each woman ate 3 dumplings, each man ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

So, the 7 men ate:
\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \text{ dumplings} \]

Now, to find out how many dumplings Larry cooked in total, we add the dumplings eaten by the women and the men:
\[ 18 + 28 = 46 \text{ dumplings} \]

So, Larry cooked 46 dumplings. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Gerald and Julia are sharing $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

First, we need to find out how much each part is worth. We do this by dividing $100 by 5:
\[ \text{Each part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, we know how much Gerald gets:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his share:
\[ \text{Money left with Gerald} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, Gerald has $50 left. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to know how fast the turtle runs. The cat runs 15 feet in one second, and the turtle is 5 times slower than the cat. So, we divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.

The turtle's speed is:
\[ 15 \text{ feet/second} \div 5 = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The correct answer is:

"To find out what percent of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, let's break it down step by step:

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of the 40% that Colorado City uses, 80% is used for industrial purposes. So, we calculate 80% of 40%:
   - 80% of 40% is the same as 0.80 times 40%.
   - 0.80 times 40% is 32%.
3. Now, to find out what percent is used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial use from the total use:
   - 40% (total use) minus 32% (industrial use) equals 8% (non-industrial use).

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

"To find out how many quarts of ice cream are made in 48 hours, we need to calculate how much chocolate and vanilla ice cream are made separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much chocolate ice cream is made in 48 hours:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- So, in 48 hours, it makes \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) times the amount it makes in 2 hours.
- Therefore, in 48 hours, it makes \( 100 \times 24 = 2400 \) quarts of chocolate ice cream.

Next, let's find out how much vanilla ice cream is made in 48 hours:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- So, in 48 hours, it makes \( \frac{48}{4} = 12 \) times the amount it makes in 4 hours.
- Therefore, in 48 hours, it makes \( 50 \times 12 = 600 \) quarts of vanilla ice cream.

Now, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together:
- Total quarts of ice cream = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Marcus spent on each type of baked good:

1. For the croissants, he bought 5 at $3.00 each. So, \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
2. For the cinnamon rolls, he bought 4 at $2.50 each. So, \(4 \times 2.5 = 10\) dollars.
3. For the mini quiches, he bought 3 at $4.00 each. So, \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.
4. For the blueberry muffins, he bought 13 at $1.00 each. So, \(13 \times 1 = 13\) dollars.

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total cost:
\[15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50\] dollars.

Next, Marcus gets a 10% discount on his total purchase. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $50:
\[10\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5\] dollars.

So, the total bill after the discount is:
\[50 - 5 = 45\] dollars.

Therefore, the total bill Marcus has to pay is $45.00.

"The ice cream parlor has a deal where you buy 2 scoops and get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00. Let's see how many scoops she can get with that money.

First, we need to figure out how many sets of 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free) Erin can get with $6.00. Each set of 3 scoops costs $3.00 because:
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50 \text{ per scoop} = \$3.00 \]

Now, we divide the money Erin has by the cost of one set of 3 scoops:
\[ \$6.00 \div \$3.00 = 2 \]

So, Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops. To find out the total number of scoops, we multiply the number of sets by 3:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream. The correct answer is:

Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's find out how many pieces of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- In two weeks, there are 14 days.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- In two weeks, there are 14 days.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, let's see how much candy Ginger has left after two weeks:
- Ginger started with 100 pieces.
- After eating 56 pieces, Ginger has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.

And how much candy Amy has left after two weeks:
- Amy started with 100 pieces.
- After eating 42 pieces, Amy has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Now, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:

"To find out how many calories are in the omelet, we need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg has 75 calories.
- So, the total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese:
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
- So, the total calories from cheese = 2 ounces * 120 calories/ounce = 240 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham:
- John uses 2 ounces of ham.
- Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
- So, the total calories from ham = 2 ounces * 40 calories/ounce = 80 calories.

   \[
   8 - 4 = 4
   \]

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week. The correct answer is 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Helga dances in two different ways. When she's dancing with both hands at her sides, she taps her right foot 300 times a minute and her left foot 250 times a minute. So, in one minute, she taps both feet 550 times (300 + 250).

When she raises her arms, she taps her right foot 200 times a minute and her left foot 200 times a minute. So, in one minute, she taps both feet 400 times (200 + 200).

Now, Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes. She raises her arms for 2 of those minutes and dances with both hands at her sides for the other 3 minutes.

First, let's calculate how many times she taps her feet when she's dancing with both hands at her sides:
- In 3 minutes, she taps 550 times per minute.
- So, \(3 \times 550 = 1650\) times.

Next, let's calculate how many times she taps her feet when she raises her arms:
- In 2 minutes, she taps 400 times per minute.
- So, \(2 \times 400 = 800\) times.

Now, we add the two totals together to find the total number of taps:
- \(1650 + 800 = 2450\).

So, the total number of times she taps both her feet is 2450.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{D}\) (assuming D is the correct option in a multiple-choice format)."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.
2. If Ron fixes it himself, he has to pay a fine of $120 and buy 3 buckets of asphalt.
3. Each bucket of asphalt costs $25, so 3 buckets cost $25 × 3 = $75.
4. The total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195.
5. To find out how much money Ron saves, we subtract the total cost from the damage the pothole would cause: $450 (damage) - $195 (cost) = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The restaurant starts with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs.
2. Some chairs are sent to the carpenter for repair:
   - 20 normal chairs are sent.
   - 13 baby chairs are sent.
3. To find out how many normal chairs are left, we subtract the sent chairs from the total:
   - Normal chairs left = 170 - 20 = 150
4. To find out how many baby chairs are left, we subtract the sent chairs from the total:
   - Baby chairs left = 23 - 13 = 10
5. Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left:
   - Total chairs left = 150 + 10 = 160

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left. The correct answer is:

**160 chairs**"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza. So, they ordered 5 pizzas in total.
2. Each pizza has 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]
3. Bryce and two of his friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. So, they ate:
   \[
   3 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]
4. The two remaining friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. So, they ate:
   \[
   2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]
5. The total number of slices eaten is:
   \[
   24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]
6. The number of slices left is:
   \[
   60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to know how long each takes.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages but in a shorter time. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, we calculate the dog's time:

\(\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20\) minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then divide by 2 to find the average time:

\((30 + 20) \div 2 = 50 \div 2 = 25\) minutes.

So, the average time they take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Topher's shoe is 100 inches long. The problem says this length is 10 inches more than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe \( x \) inches.

So, we have the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

First, we need to get rid of the 10 on the right side. We do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, to find \( x \), we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of Bobby's shoe is 10 inches.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Hannah smashes windows in the parking lot. There are 64 cars with students and 32 cars with teachers.

Each student car has 4 windows, so:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Each teacher car has 2 windows, so:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

She also smashes three-quarters of the teachers' windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows she smashes from both types of cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \text{ windows} \]

So, the number of windows Hannah smashes is 112. The correct answer is:

"To find out what percentage of Candy's spools are blue, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, let's add up all the spools Candy has:
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   So, the total number of spools is:
   15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. Now, let's count how many of these are blue:
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   So, the total number of blue spools is:
   15 + 45 = 60

3. To find out what percentage of the total spools are blue, we use this formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = 0.4
   \]

5. Now, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:
   \[
   0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

At first, 5000 people were waiting to vote. By midday, 2 out of every 5 people voted. So, we calculate how many people that is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 people voted by midday. That means:

\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

people were still waiting to vote.

By the end of the day, 2 out of every 3 of the remaining people voted. So, we calculate how many people that is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 more people voted by the end of the day. That means:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

people did not vote by the end of the day.

So, the number of people who did not vote by 16:00 is 1000. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can do the following:

1. Parker chews 4 pieces of gum each day.
2. In 30 days, he will chew \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \) pieces of gum.
3. Each pack of gum has 15 pieces.
4. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total pieces of gum by the pieces in each pack: \( 120 \div 15 = 8 \).

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many smores are needed in total. There are 9 kids and each kid wants 2 smores, so:
   \[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]

2. There are also 6 adults and each adult wants 1 smore, so:
   \[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

3. Adding these together gives the total number of smores needed:
   \[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

4. Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores. So, to find out how many sleeves are needed, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores each sleeve makes:
   \[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

5. Each box contains 3 sleeves, so to find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of sleeves by the number of sleeves in a box:
   \[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, they will need 1 box of graham crackers. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Dora is 15 years old. We need to find out how old Dora's father and mother are.

1. Dora's father is 8 more than twice Dora's age.
   - Twice Dora's age is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
   - So, Dora's father is \(30 + 8 = 38\) years old.

2. Dora's mother is 4 years younger than Dora's father.
   - So, Dora's mother is \(38 - 4 = 34\) years old.

Now, to find the total age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
- Dora's age: 15
- Father's age: 38
- Mother's age: 34

Adding these together: \(15 + 38 + 34 = 87\).

So, the total combined age is 87 years. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Cindy has:
- 2 math books, each 2 pounds, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- 2 science books, each 2 pounds, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- 1 French book that weighs 4 pounds.
- 1 English book that weighs 3 pounds.
- 1 history book that weighs twice as much as the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Math and science books: \(4 + 4 = 8\) pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: 6 pounds.

Adding these together:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there were 100 voters in total. Candidate A got 20% of the votes. So, we calculate how many votes that is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more votes than Candidate A. So, we first find out how many more votes that is:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes} \]

So, Candidate B got:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many votes Candidate C got. We know the total number of votes is 100. So, we subtract the votes for Candidate A and Candidate B from the total:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Therefore, Candidate C got 50 votes. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so we can find out how many apples Beck has by subtracting 23 from 100. 

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck starts with 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Peter has 32 ounces of water. He wants to make different sizes of ice cubes. He can make giant cubes, medium cubes, and small cubes. Here's how much water each type of cube uses:

- Giant cubes use 4 ounces of water each.
- Medium cubes use 2 ounces of water each.
- Small cubes use 1/2 an ounce of water each.

Peter makes:
- 3 giant cubes, so he uses \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces of water.
- 7 medium cubes, so he uses \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces of water.
- 8 small cubes, so he uses \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces of water.

Now, let's add up all the water used:
- Water used for giant cubes: 12 ounces
- Water used for medium cubes: 14 ounces
- Water used for small cubes: 4 ounces

Total water used: \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Now, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial amount of water: 32 ounces
- Water left: \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left. The correct answer is:

We know Clara has 20 books. Clara has twice as many books as Steven. So, if Clara has 20 books, Steven must have half of that. 

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven. So, we add 6 to the number of books Steven has.

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books.

\[ \text{More books Clara has than Alice} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 less than a half-gallon jar. So, we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from $5.

\[
\text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to calculate how much Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

1. The cost of 10 gallon jars:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
   \[
   16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

To find the total amount Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together:
\[
50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's break it down simply.

We have a class of 50 students. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the rest of the students like to play video games or play music.

First, we need to find out how many students are left after we subtract those who like baking and playing basketball from the total number of students.

\[ 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

So, 35 students like to play video games or play music. We are told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know that 10 students like to play music and 35 students like to play video games or music. So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 35 - 10 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jeremy saw 12 birds in his backyard. He threw a stone and scared away 1 out of every 3 birds. So, he scared away 12 birds ÷ 3 = 4 birds. That means 12 birds - 4 birds = 8 birds are still there.

A few minutes later, 20 more birds came to join the backyard. So, the total number of birds now is 8 birds + 20 birds = 28 birds.

The number of birds in the backyard now is 28."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 80 students in total, and they are divided into two classes with the same number of students in each class. So, each class has:

In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the rest must be boys. So, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24. The correct answer is:

Mark bought 3 packs of magic cards for $1800 each. So, the total cost was:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars} \]

He got some cards from opening these packs. He got:
- 1 card worth $4000
- 1 card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth $50 each

First, let's find out how much all these cards are worth together:
- The $4000 card is worth $4000
- The $1000 card is worth $1000
- The 30 cards worth $50 each are worth \( 30 \times 50 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \)

Now, let's add up the value of all the cards:

First, let's calculate the cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26.
- The cost for each child is $12.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children.

Total cost for adults at the first park:
\[ 2 \times 26 = 52 \]

Total cost for children at the first park:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Total cost for the first amusement park:
\[ 52 + 24 = 76 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for the second amusement park:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

The tomato vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each and he buys 500 tomatoes a day. So, the cost per day was:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, he switched to a new vendor who sells tomatoes for $0.4 each. So, the cost per day with the new vendor is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

To find out how much money he saves each day, we subtract the new cost from the old cost:
\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much he saves in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$350/\text{week} \]

So, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

We know Sean has 56 marbles. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

So, Carl has 224 marbles.

We also know Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, if Sean has 56 marbles, Cal must have:

\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have together, we add their marbles:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined.

"To solve this, let's think about it step by step.

We have 54 students and we need to form 12 groups. First, we need to find out how many students would be in each group if we form 12 groups.

1. Divide the total number of students by the number of groups:
   \[
   \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}
   \]

Since we can't have half a student in a group, we know that 12 groups is not possible. So, we need to find out how many groups we can actually form with 54 students.

2. Now, let's find out how many groups we can form if we divide the students into 6 groups:
   \[
   \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]

This means we can form 6 groups of 9 students each.

3. To find out how many more groups we need to form 12 groups, we subtract the number of groups we can form from 12:
   \[
   12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}

"To find out how many chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented each month and then double that number.

First, let's find out how many chairs Candy rents in one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
- Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday, so in 20 weekdays, Candy rents \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.

- There are 2 weekend days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
- Candy rents 100 chairs each weekend day, so in 8 weekend days, Candy rents \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

Now, we add the chairs rented on weekdays and weekend days to find the total for one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

Since we need to find out how many chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we double the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs.

So, Candy can rent out 4000 chairs in two 4-week months. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
2. Arnold steals half of the bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]
3. Gunther adds 25 more bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after adding 25} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]
4. Arnold steals 12 more bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]
5. Gunther adds 6 more bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after adding 6} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

So, the number of bananas Gunther finds is 43.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that the total electricity bill for one month is $100.
2. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the $100 by 4 to find out how much each roommate pays each month. So, each roommate pays $100 ÷ 4 = $25 each month.
3. Now, we need to find out how much each roommate pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply $25 by 12. So, each roommate pays $25 × 12 = $300 in a year.

The correct answer is C. $300."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Jeff sent out:
- 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, so that's 96 glasses.
- 4 dozen plates, which is 4 times 12, so that's 48 plates.

When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken.

So, the number of glasses left is:
96 glasses - 10 broken glasses = 86 glasses

And the number of plates left is:
48 plates - 6 broken plates = 42 plates

Now, to find out how many items Jeff has now, we add the glasses and plates together:
86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

So, Jeff has 128 items now. The correct answer is C."
"Let's break down the problem step by step in a simpler way:

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. So, she trades 90% of 30 small stickers, which is 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 large buttons.
3. Now, she has 3 small stickers left and 40 - 27 = 13 large stickers.
4. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. So, she trades 50% of 13 large stickers, which is 6.5. Since she can't trade half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 6 large stickers (rounding down). Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, so trading 6 large stickers gives her 6 large buttons.
5. Now, she has 13 - 6 = 7 large stickers left and 3 small stickers.
6. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. So, she trades 7 large stickers. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so trading 7 large stickers gives her 7 * 3 = 21 small buttons.
7. Now, she has 3 small stickers and 21 small buttons from trading large stickers, so in total, she has 3 + 21 = 24 small buttons.
8. Adding the large buttons she got from trading small stickers and the large buttons she got from trading large stickers, she has 27 + 6 = 33 buttons in total.

So, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 33. The correct answer is:

B) 33"
"Let's count the matches Joey played each day:

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, let's add up all the matches:
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\).

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 33 people on the council. The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \). So, the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know this total is 33, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, there were 11 votes against the new regulation. The number of votes in favor is twice this number:

\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{22}

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know 11 students need extra-small (XS) shirts.
2. Twice as many students need small (S) shirts as extra-small (XS) shirts. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ students need small (S) shirts}
   \]
3. Four less than the number of small (S) shirts need medium (M) shirts. So, we calculate:
   \[
   22 - 4 = 18 \text{ students need medium (M) shirts}
   \]
4. Half as many students need large (L) shirts as medium (M) shirts. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ students need large (L) shirts}
   \]
5. Six more students need extra-large (XL) shirts than large (L) shirts. So, we calculate:
   \[
   9 + 6 = 15 \text{ students need extra-large (XL) shirts}
   \]

Now, we add up all the students:
\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. We have a bag that is marked at $140.
2. There is a 5% discount on the bag.
3. To find out how much we pay after the discount, we first need to calculate what 5% of $140 is.
4. 5% of $140 is calculated by multiplying $140 by 0.05 (since 5% is the same as 5/100 or 0.05).
5. So, \( 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \).
6. This means the discount is $7.
7. To find out how much we pay after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price: \( 140 - 7 = 133 \).

So, after the discount, we will pay $133.

The correct answer is C. $133."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John has 20 playlists, and each playlist has 300 songs. So, we need to find out how many songs are there in total.

First, we calculate the total number of songs:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Each song is 10 hours long. So, to find out the total number of hours, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000 hours. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{60000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find out how many that is, we do:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \text{ people}
   \]
   So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

2. Now, we subtract the 10 people who think horse #2 will win from the total 50 people:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people}
   \]
   So, 40 people are left.

3. Next, 60% of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find out how many that is, we do:
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24 \text{ people}
   \]
   So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

4. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many that is, we subtract the 24 people who think horse #7 will win from the 40 people left:
   \[
   40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people}
   \]
   So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is \boxed{16}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's call the total number of puppies \( P \). So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is \( \frac{2}{3}P \).

We also know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. So, the number of Pomeranian girls is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( \frac{2}{3}P \), which is \( \frac{2}{9}P \).

The problem tells us that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve this equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 9 and then dividing by 2:
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total. The correct answer is:

"Jayden had $70 from selling pictures. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the money he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85. So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles. Then the first house needs half of what the second house needs, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases. The third house needs double what the first house needs, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

So, the total number of cases is:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double what the first house needs, which is also 100 cases.

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. The correct answer is:

C. 100"

"To find out how many fruits George has, we need to add the number of bananas and pears together.

First, we know George has 200 bananas.

Next, we need to find out how many pears George has. The problem tells us that George has 45% more pears than bananas. So, we calculate 45% of 200 bananas:
\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

Now, we add this number to the number of bananas to find the number of pears:
\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 = 290 \]

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together:
\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 200 + 290 = 490 \]

So, George has 490 fruits in total. The correct answer is:

"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. We need to find out how much money Sam would spend to make 4 liters of juice.

First, we calculate how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs for 4 liters of juice:
- 1 liter of juice needs 5 kilograms of oranges.
- So, 4 liters of juice need \(4 \times 5 = 20\) kilograms of oranges.

Next, we calculate the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges:
- Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
- So, 20 kilograms of oranges cost \(20 \times 3 = 60\) dollars.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend **60 dollars** to make 4 liters of juice.

The correct answer is **C**."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, so Ezra read 300 books. Then Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so he read 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Now, to find out how many books they read altogether, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the number of books Ezra read. So, 150 (Ahmed's books) + 450 (Ezra's books) = 600 books.

Therefore, the total number of books they read together is 600.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each. So, she teaches for a total of:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

For these 20 hours, she earns:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$300 \]

Since she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 for the day:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each. So, she teaches for a total of:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

For these 4 hours, she earns:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Since she teaches only 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes, she doesn't get the extra $5 for the day.

Now, let's add up her earnings for both days:

"Jack drives to the museum and back home. He drives 150 miles to the museum and 150 miles back home. He drives at a speed of 75 miles per hour.

To find out how long it takes him to drive to the museum, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:
\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:
\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Mike has 600 movies. A third of these are in series. So, we need to find out how many movies are in series:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]
So, 200 movies are in series.

This means the rest of the movies are not in series:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]
So, 400 movies are not in series.

Out of these 400 movies, 40% are older movies. So, we calculate how many are older:
\[ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]
So, 160 movies are older.

This means the rest of the non-series movies are not older:
\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \]
So, 240 movies are not older.

Now, we need to find out the cost of replacing these movies. The cost for the series movies is $6 each, and the cost for the non-series movies is $10 each. The cost for the older movies is $5 each.

First, let's find the cost for the series movies:
\[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]
So, the cost for the series movies is $1200.

Next, let's find the cost for the non-older non-series movies:
\[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]
So, the cost for the non-older non-series movies is $2400.

Finally, let's find the cost for the older movies:
\[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \]
So, the cost for the older movies is $800.

Winston picked different fruits and we need to find out how much he spent. Here's how we can do it:

1. For peaches:
   - He picked 6 pounds.
   - The cost is $2.00 per pound.
   - So, the cost for peaches is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

2. For plums:
   - He picked 8 pounds.
   - The cost is $1.00 per pound.
   - So, the cost for plums is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) dollars.

3. For apricots:
   - He picked 6 pounds.
   - The cost is $3.00 per pound.
   - So, the cost for apricots is \(6 \times 3 = 18\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost for peaches: $12
- Cost for plums: $8
- Cost for apricots: $18

Total cost = $12 + $8 + $18 = $38

So, Winston spent $38 on fruit. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how far the vacation spot is, we need to add the distance they drove to the distance they hiked.

First, we calculate the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour.
- So, the distance they drove is 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked:
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- So, their hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the distance they hiked is 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove to the distance they hiked:
- Total distance = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

So, the vacation spot is 330 miles away. The correct answer is C."

Ava and Emma are playing a video game. They both get the same score for enemies and berries, but Ava finishes 4 seconds slower. We need to find out how much more points Ava got compared to Emma.

1. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma. So, if Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
2. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma. So, if Emma collects \( B \) berries, Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
3. Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Now, let's calculate the points for each player:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E + 8 - E) = 10 \times 8 = 80 \) points.
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B + 3 - B) = 5 \times 3 = 15 \) points.
- Points from time left: \( 30 \times (T - (T + 4)) = 30 \times (-4) = -120 \) points.

So, Ava's total score is:
\[ 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 \]

Emma's total score is:
\[ 10 \times (E - E) + 5 \times (B - B) + 30 \times (T - (T + 4)) = 0 + 0 - 120 = -120 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ -25 - (-120) = -25 + 120 = 95 \]

So, Ava got 95 more points than Emma.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. We need to find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost if they cost the same amount.

First, let's see how much the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each cost in total:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. So, the cost of the other two pizzas together is:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Chase and Rider usually ride their bikes 3 times a day. They do this for 5 days. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On two other days, they ride their bikes twice as much as usual. So, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
For 2 days, they ride:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange and 4 were white.

He went to the pet store and got 17 more fish. We need to find out how many of these were white.

Let's say he got \( w \) white fish and \( o \) orange fish. So, \( w + o = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \).

The problem states that after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. So, we have:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now, substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ w + (2w + 5) = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

The correct answer is:
\[

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week. He goes to work from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days. Each day he drives 5 miles one way, so round trip is 10 miles. Therefore, in a week, he drives:
   \[
   5 \text{ days/week} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 50 \text{ miles/week}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses for these 50 miles. His car is 10 miles per gallon, so:
   \[
   \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week}
   \]

3. Now, we know the price of gas is $3 per gallon. So, the cost for 5 gallons is:
   \[
   5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carrie's aunt gave her some money. She gave her ten twenties and 140 quarters. We need to find out how much money Carrie spent on lunch.

First, let's find out how much money is in the twenties. Each twenty is worth $20, and she has ten twenties. So, we do:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money is in the quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, and she has 140 quarters. So, we do:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find out how much 3/5 of the twenties is, we do:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie spent is:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]

The correct answer is D."
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get, we need to add the tomatoes and eggplants together.

First, we calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.

So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get is 142. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to know how many smart TVs and analog TVs were sold. We know that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. The rest are OLED TVs.

First, let's find out how many smart TVs were sold:
- One-fourth of 40 TVs is 40 divided by 4, which is 10 TVs.

Next, let's find out how many analog TVs were sold:
- One-eighth of 40 TVs is 40 divided by 8, which is 5 TVs.

Now, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold to find out how many OLED TVs were sold:
- Total TVs sold = 40
- Smart TVs sold = 10
- Analog TVs sold = 5

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
- OLED TVs sold = Total TVs sold - (Smart TVs sold + Analog TVs sold)
- OLED TVs sold = 40 - (10 + 5)
- OLED TVs sold = 40 - 15
- OLED TVs sold = 25

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25. The correct answer is C."

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Carson's house gets cold at night. During the day, it's 45 degrees. At night, it gets 33 degrees colder than during the day. So, we need to find out how cold it gets at night.

First, we calculate the night temperature:
\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes freeze if the temperature is below 32 degrees. So, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the house warm enough to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

We have 90 people going on a trip. They need to split into groups of 9 people each. So, we divide 90 by 9 to find out how many groups there are:
\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]
So, there are 10 groups.

Now, we know that 3 out of every 5 groups brought back seashells. To find out how many groups brought back seashells, we do:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]
So, 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. To find out the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by 2:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the total number of seashells they brought back is 12.

The correct answer is:

1. Jamie works 8 hours a day at $20 per hour. So, for 8 hours, she earns:
   \[
   8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so the extra hours she worked are:
   \[
   11 - 8 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. For the extra 3 hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. Her regular hourly rate is $20, so 150% of $20 is:

"Mike saw that his favorite jeans were on sale for 25% off. The original price of the jeans was $40.00. To find out how much he has to pay now, we need to calculate 25% of $40.00 and then subtract that from $40.00.

25% of $40.00 is calculated as:
\[ 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]

So, the sale price of the jeans is:
\[ 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left, we subtract the sale price from $50.00:
\[ 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

So, Mike will have $20.00 left over. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The company starts with 200 employees. Every month, they hire 20 new employees. So after three months, they will have hired:
\[ 20 \text{ new employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ new employees} \]

Adding these new employees to the initial 200 employees gives:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total salary for all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much they pay in three months:

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their earnings for 20 hours each.

First, let's find out how much Billy earns:
1. Billy's initial hourly wage is $10.
2. After 2 months, his wage increases to $10.50.
3. On his first anniversary, his wage increases to $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Billy's earnings:
- For the first 2 months, he earns $10 per hour for 20 hours each month. So, for 2 months, he earns:
  \[
  10 \times 20 \times 2 = 400 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- After the raise, he earns $11.50 per hour for 20 hours. So, for the next 2 months, he earns:
  \[
  11.50 \times 20 \times 2 = 460 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Adding these together, Billy's total earnings are:
  \[
  400 + 460 = 860 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's find out how much Sally earns:
1. Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, so it is $10.50.
2. Sally works 20 hours each month for 2 months, so her total earnings are:
  \[
  10.50 \times 20 \times 2 = 420 \text{ dollars}

"Kris wants to play a total of 30 hours to earn a video game achievement. She has already played for half an hour every day for 2 weeks and 2 hours every day for a week.

First, let's calculate how many hours she played in the first 2 weeks:
- She plays half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
- 2 weeks have 14 days.
- So, she played \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate how many hours she played in the last week:
- She plays 2 hours every day for 7 days.
- So, she played \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours in the last week.

Now, let's add the hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week:
- Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Janet is looking at the results of a test that was given to students at Herbert Hoover Elementary School. She found out how many students passed the test in each grade.

- In the third grade, 340 out of 500 students passed the test. That means 340/500 = 0.68 or 68% of the third graders passed.
- In the fourth grade, 40 out of 100 students passed the test. That means 40/100 = 0.40 or 40% of the fourth graders passed.
- In the fifth grade, twice as many students passed as in the fourth grade. So, 2 times 40 is 80. That means 80 out of 400 students passed the test. That means 80/400 = 0.20 or 20% of the fifth graders passed.

Now, let's add up all the students who passed:
- Third grade: 340 students
- Fourth grade: 40 students
- Fifth grade: 80 students

Total students who passed = 340 + 40 + 80 = 460 students

Now, let's add up all the students tested:
- Third grade: 500 students
- Fourth grade: 100 students
- Fifth grade: 400 students

Total students tested = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students tested:
Overall pass rate = 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%

So, the school's overall pass rate is 46%. The correct answer is C."
"Milo needs 12 chips to make one square inch of his mosaic. He has two bags of chips, and each bag has 72 chips. So, he has a total of:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

He wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we need to know how many square inches he can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, he can make:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

If his mosaic is 3 inches tall, then the length \( L \) of the mosaic can be found by dividing the total square inches by the height:

3. By the end of the second month (February), the number of students doubles again, so we have:
   \[
   20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ students}
   \]
4. By the end of the third month (March), the number of students doubles again, so we have:
   \[
   40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ students}
   \]
5. By the end of the fourth month (April), the number of students doubles again, so we have:
   \[
   80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ students}
   \]
6. By the end of the fifth month (May), the number of students doubles again, so we have:
   \[
   160 \times 2 = 320 \text{ students}
   \]

Now, to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we subtract the number of students at the beginning of the year from the number of students at the end of May:
\[
320 - 10 = 310 \text{ students}
\]

So, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310. The correct answer is:

\boxed{C} (Assuming the options were provided as A, B, C, D and the correct answer was C)"
"Felix made $105 by climbing branches. Each branch costs $0.25. To find out how many branches he climbed, we divide the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ 105 \div 0.25 = 420 \]

So, Felix climbed 420 branches in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total branches by 7 to find out how many branches he climbed each day:

\[ 420 \div 7 = 60 \]

Felix climbed 60 branches each day on average. The correct answer is:

**B**"
"Let's break it down step by step:

Rose picks flowers and counts the petals:

1. She picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
2. Then she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. So, \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
3. Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. So, \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. So, \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Now, let's add all these petals together:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Rose drops 1 flower of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

So, she drops \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

Now, we subtract the dropped petals from the total:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

So, the number of petals left in the vase is 79. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{79}\)"
"John and DeSean bought a bag of 35 marshmallows. They each made 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. First, we need to find out how many marshmallows they used in total.

John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the original number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows left} \]

John and DeSean each need 1 marshmallow to make 1 S'more. So, with 14 marshmallows left, they can each make:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the number of S'mores each can have is 7. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. He has 3 friends, and they play for a total of 4 hours. First, we need to find out how many minutes 4 hours is. 

4 hours = 4 × 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's see how much time each person can play:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes.
- Each of the two worse friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they each play for 20 ÷ 2 = 10 minutes.
- The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he plays for 20 × 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time they can play:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- The two worse friends together play for 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.
- The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

So, the total time they can play together is 20 + 20 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since each quarter lets them play for 20 minutes, we need to find out how many quarters they need to play for 240 minutes:
- 240 minutes ÷ 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

So, they use 12 quarters. The correct answer is:

\boxed{B} (Assuming B is the correct option in a multiple-choice format, if provided.)"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tanya makes a salt scrub with different ingredients. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the same amount of salt as sugar, twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

First, let's say the amount of salt she uses is \( S \) ounces. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, she also uses \( S \) ounces of sugar. Because she uses twice as much oil as salt, she uses \( 2S \) ounces of oil. Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, she also uses \( S \) ounces of fragrance.

Now, we know the total mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 6S = 10 \]
To find \( S \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]
So, the amount of oil she uses is \( 2S \):
\[ 2S = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]
Therefore, the amount of oil she uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces.

Now, let's look at the multiple-choice options for the amount of oil she uses:
A. 2 ounces
B. 3 ounces
C. 4 ounces

"John bought 3 goats, and each goat cost $500. So, the goats cost 3 times $500, which is 3 * $500 = $1500.

He also bought 2 cows, and each cow cost $1500. So, the cows cost 2 times $1500, which is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

To find out how much money John spent in total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together. So, $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. So, he has a total of 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes. He needs 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs, we subtract the cupcakes he already has from the total he needs:

63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step as if I'm a person with primary school level education.

1. **How many cars does Joe have initially?**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - So, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **How many cars does Joe sell?**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.
   - So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. **How many cars does Joe give to his mother?**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - So, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **How many cars does Joe have left?**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars, so he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
   - He gives away 16 cars, so he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

So, Joe has 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

The correct answer is **16**."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

The total money raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. So, the students raised the rest of the money. To find out how much the students raised, we subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we know that 20 students raised this amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

The correct answer is:
6250"
"To find out the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to add the time she spent walking each day.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is 8 hours divided by 2, equaling 4 hours.

So, the total time she walked is 8 hours on the first day plus 4 hours on the second day, which is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 12 hours into minutes. We do this by multiplying 12 hours by 60 minutes per hour:

12 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes. The correct answer is:

C. 720 minutes"

**B** (assuming B is the correct option in a multiple-choice question)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John does 30 cycles of work a day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. We need to find out how much he makes in a week if he works 7 days.

First, let's find out how much he makes in one day:
- He does 30 cycles a day.
- Each cycle has 5 tasks.
- So, he does 30 cycles/day × 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.
- Each task pays $1.20.
- So, he makes 150 tasks/day × $1.20/task = $180/day.

Now, we need to find out how much he makes in a week:
- He works 7 days a week.
- So, he makes $180/day × 7 days/week = $1260/week.

So, John makes $1260 in a week. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 points less than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Julie scored 10 points in the first game. Sasha scored 6 points less than Julie in the second game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Now, to find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we add the points from both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

So, Sasha scored 14 + 4 = 18 points in total.

The correct answer is 18 points."
"Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package has 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

She also bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package has 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \text{ tins} \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

We know the total number of cards is 341. Let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. Then Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards because Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm a primary school student.

Cindy has 5 green eggs. That's easy to remember.

Next, she has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, if she has 5 green eggs, she has:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]
blue eggs.

She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. So, if she has 10 blue eggs, she has:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \]
pink eggs.

She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, if she has 9 pink eggs, she has:
\[ \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]
yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[ 5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27 \]

So, Cindy has 27 eggs in total.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the shipping cost is. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 for each pound. So, for 4 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the shipping company also charges $0.08 for each mile. The book needs to be sent 20 miles away, so the cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost for the weight and the cost for the distance to get the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The book cost Milly $32, but she can only get back 75% of that because Amazon refunds only 75%. So, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money Milly loses, we subtract the refundable amount from the total cost:
\[ 32 + 3.00 - 24 = 11.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Milly will lose \(\boxed{11}\) dollars."
"Mulan starts with $40. Her father gives her $100, so she has $40 + $100 = $140. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 × $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total cost of the jeans and the bag is $60 + $20 = $80. Now, we subtract the total cost from the money she had: $140 - $80 = $60. So, Mulan has $60 left. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week.
2. In the second week, he produces half of what he produced in the first week, so he produces \(8,000 \div 2 = 4,000\) bars.
3. In the third week, he produces three times what he produced in the first week, so he produces \(8,000 \times 3 = 24,000\) bars.
4. To find out how many bars he produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production. The total monthly production is 50,000 bars.
5. So, the production in the fourth week is \(50,000 - (8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000) = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000\) bars.

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month.

First, we need to find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok each week. We know she records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, we calculate the time spent on videos:
\[ 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know she spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, we convert 2 hours to minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She also spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. So, we calculate the time spent on makeup:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add up all the time she spends on TikTok-related activities each week:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 282 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4 to find the total time spent in a month:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
\[ 1128 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

So, Britany spends 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Angela.

First, we know the base cost for the installation is $129.00. This cost includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Now, Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

We need to find out how many more mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures Angela needs:
- Additional mirrors needed: \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- Additional chandeliers needed: \(2 - 1 = 1\)
- Additional pictures needed: \(20 - 10 = 10\)

The cost to install each additional item is $15.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the additional items:
- Cost for additional mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
- Cost for additional chandeliers: \(1 \times 15 = 15\)
- Cost for additional pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\)

Now, we add the base cost to the cost of the additional items:
- Total cost: \(129 + 30 + 15 + 150 = 324\)

So, the total cost for Angela is $324.00.

The correct answer is:

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Next, we find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. Then, we find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. Finally, we find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we divide 480 inches by 12:
\[
480 \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet}

"Mason rides his bike at a speed of 8 miles per hour. He rides for 4 hours and then rides for another 6 hours. To find out how many miles he has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance for each part of his journey and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first part:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance for the second part:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 6 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
- Total Distance = Distance of First Part + Distance of Second Part
- Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles. The correct answer is C."
"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step.

1. We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway.
2. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, then 1 kangaroo would take 18 hours divided by 3, which is 6 hours.
3. So, each kangaroo travels the highway in 6 hours.
4. Now, we need to find out how long it will take 4 turtles to travel the same distance.
5. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if a kangaroo takes 6 hours, a turtle would take twice as long because it's traveling at half the speed.
6. Therefore, each turtle would take 6 hours times 2, which is 12 hours.
7. Since we have 4 turtles, they would still take the same time as one turtle because they are all traveling the same distance at the same time.
8. So, 4 turtles will take 12 hours to travel across the highway.

The correct answer is B."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Kora made 20 clay dishes. Rory made 20 more than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, so Jada made 2 × 40 = 80 clay dishes.

Now, to find out how many they all made together, we add up the number of dishes each of them made:
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

So, together they made 140 clay dishes.

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs, we can do the following:

1. First, we know that 3 cows produce 5 liters of milk each day. So, 3 cows produce 3 times 5 liters, which is 15 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
3. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the milk produced by 3 cows from the total milk needed: 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters.
4. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk. We do this by dividing the additional milk needed by the milk each cow produces: 10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 cows.

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The correct answer is:

B. 2"

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. So, the length left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   This means 2 millimeters are used, so the rest is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. So, the length left is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   This means 8 millimeters are used, so the rest is:
   \[
   12 - 8 = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. So, the length left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   This means 6 millimeters are used, so the rest is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}

"Gabriel wants to buy a car that costs $10000 and a phone that costs $800. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. First, we need to find out how much money Gabriel has in total. So, we add $5000 and $200 together:

\[ 5000 + 200 = 5200 \]

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ 10000 + 800 = 10800 \]

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ 10800 - 5200 = 5600 \]

So, Gabriel still needs $5600. The correct answer is:

D. $5600"
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is a total of 4 * $20 = $80. The hat she bought cost $70. To find out how much change she got, we subtract the cost of the hat from the amount she gave: $80 - $70 = $10. So, Thea got $10 in change. 

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each, so the cost is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total cost from the money he started with:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Craig has 19 dollars left. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks. So, if Jack has 60 dishes, he must have half that number in socks. That means Jack has \(60 \div 2 = 30\) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has \(30 \times 2 = 60\) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has \(60 \div 2 = 30\) dishes.
5. Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes:
   - Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so in total, Jack has \(30 + 60 = 90\) items.
   - Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so in total, Peter has \(60 + 30 = 90\) items.
   - Together, they have \(90 + 90 = 180\) items.

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180. The correct answer is:

C. 180"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 20 students in total. Out of these, 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. We need to find out how many students are good at both math and English.

First, let's add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 8 \text{ (English only)} = 13 \]

This means 13 students are either good at math only, good at English only, or good at both. Since there are 20 students in total, the rest must be good at both math and English:
\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 7 \text{ (both)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Vicki's concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. She has 10 minutes for an intermission, so that leaves 110 minutes for the groups to perform.

Each group has 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off the stage. So, the total time for one group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many groups can fit into the 110 minutes. We do this by dividing the remaining time by the time one group takes:
\[ 110 \div 10 = 11 \]

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest first. The simple interest formula is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal is $300, the rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \), and the time is 3 years.

First, we calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

Let's do the math step by step:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the simple interest earned over 3 years is $2025.

Now, we add this simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

Therefore, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, so that means:
- White shirts with collars: 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars: 40 - 20 = 20

For the floral shirts:
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars:
- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts without collars: 20

So, the difference is:
30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars. The answer is 10."
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to figure out how many trays the farmer can make with 900 eggs, and then calculate the total earnings.

Each tray holds 30 eggs. So, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ 900 \div 30 = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Now, if each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the farmer will earn $75. The correct answer is:

C. $75"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Smith has two farms. On Farm X, he has 55 goats. On Farm Y, he has 45 goats.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X. So, the number of goats left on Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. So, he sold:
2 × 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

The number of goats left on Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Now, to find out how many goats are left in total, we add the goats left on both farms:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms is 70. The correct answer is C."
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. In a year, he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, James pays $110 on average for each pair of shoes. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"To find out the total cost, we first calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately, then add them together.

1. The cost of one basket of green food is $25. So, for 3 baskets of green food, the cost is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The cost of one basket of red food is $18, but you get $2 off for each basket. So, the cost of one basket of red food after the discount is:
   \[
   18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   For 3 baskets of red food, the cost is:
   \[
   3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Now, we add the cost of the green food and the red food together to get the total cost:
   \[
   75 + 48 = 123 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total amount you have to pay is $123. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. We have 90 rooms at the motel.
2. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.
3. We need to clean half of the rooms, which is 45 rooms.
4. To find out how many minutes it takes to clean 45 rooms, we multiply 45 by 20 minutes:
   \[
   45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]
5. Now, we need to convert 900 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 by 60:
   \[
   900 \div 60 = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

The correct answer is **C**."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
In the second year, they build three times 12 homes, which is 36 homes.
So, in the first two years, they build 12 + 36 = 48 homes.
In the third year, they double the number of homes they built in the first two years, which is 2 times 48 = 96 homes.

Now, to find out how many homes they built in total over the three years, we add the homes from each year:
12 (first year) + 36 (second year) + 96 (third year) = 144 homes.

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years. The correct answer is C."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. You are three years younger than your brother, so if your brother is \( B \) years old, you are \( B - 3 \) years old.
2. You are two years older than your sister, so if your sister is \( S \) years old, you are \( S + 2 \) years old.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom is \( 3B - 1 \) years old.
4. The sum of all your ages is 87, so \( B - 3 + B + S + S + 2 + 3B - 1 = 87 \).

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + S + S + 2 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + 2S - 2 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + 2S = 89 \]

We also know that \( S = B - 3 \), so we can substitute \( S \) in the equation:
\[ 5B + 2(B - 3) = 89 \]
\[ 5B + 2B - 6 = 89 \]
\[ 7B - 6 = 89 \]
\[ 7B = 95 \]
\[ B = 13 \]

So, your brother is 13 years old. Since you are three years younger than your brother, you are:
\[ 13 - 3 = 10 \]

Therefore, you are 10 years old. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:
   \[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks he needs to buy. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks by 8:
   \[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

3. Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he wants to have some extra glue sticks left over, he needs to round up to the next whole number. So, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is 7.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

On the first day, the river has 4000 gallons of water. After a day of heavy rain, the water doubles, so we have \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons. On the third day, the water increases by 6000 gallons, so we add 6000 to 8000, which gives us \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The correct answer is C."
"Let's break it down step by step:

On the first day, 10 people are infected. Each of these 10 people infects 6 others. So, on the first day, 10 * 6 = 60 new people get infected. Now the total number of infected people is 10 (original) + 60 (new) = 70.

On the second day, each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others. So, 70 * 6 = 420 new people get infected. Now the total number of infected people is 70 (from the first day) + 420 (new) = 490.

On the third day, each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others. So, 490 * 6 = 2940 new people get infected. Now the total number of infected people is 490 (from the second day) + 2940 (new) = 3430.

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 customers. So, we multiply $20 by 40 to find out how much money Rafaela got in total.

\[ 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta got 10% less money than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800.

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta got $80 less than Rafaela. Now, we subtract $80 from $800 to find out how much Julieta got.

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money Rafaela and Julieta got together.

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total money they both got is $1520.

The correct answer is C."
"Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so that's 2 oranges × 3 daughters = 6 oranges. Her son got 3 oranges. So, in total, she gave away 6 oranges + 3 oranges = 9 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she has left, we subtract the oranges she gave away from the oranges she bought: 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

So, Jennifer has 3 oranges left. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. So in a year, which has 12 months, Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So if Claire takes 1 month, Amber takes 2 months to earn a badge. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns 3 times the number of badges Claire earns in the same time. So in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns than Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{C} \]

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Paige bakes banana bread from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That's 5 hours. In one hour, she can bake 2 loaves of banana bread. So, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf of banana bread is cut into 8 slices. So, from 10 loaves, she gets:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. So, the total money she makes is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 4000 cents to dollars:
\[ 4000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Paige raised:
\[ \boxed{40} \text{ dollars} \]

The correct answer is D."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The problem also tells us that she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let the number of silver coins be \( S \), then we can write:

\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = \text{Number of silver coins} + 30 \]

Since we know the number of gold coins is 70, we can substitute that in:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find out how many silver coins she has, we need to solve for \( S \). We do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 70 - 30 = S \]
\[ 40 = S \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total number of coins} = \text{Number of gold coins} + \text{Number of silver coins} \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 110 \]

So, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic. There were 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos. So, we need to find out how many burritos the students got in total and then subtract the burritos Mr. George ate.

First, we calculate how many burritos the students got:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we subtract the 20 burritos Mr. George ate:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the 480 burritos the students and Mr. George ate from the total 600 burritos:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 480 \text{ burritos} = 120 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the number of leftover burritos is 120.

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

We know the rink has 12 red cars. Now, we need to find out how many green and blue cars there are.

1. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, if we take the number of red cars (12), we subtract 2:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]
   So, there are 10 green cars.

2. The rink has 3 times as many blue cars as green cars. So, we take the number of green cars (10) and multiply it by 3:
   \[
   10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
   So, there are 30 blue cars.

Now, let's add up all the red, green, and blue cars:
\[
12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52
\]

The rink has a total of 75 cars. To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

"Let's solve this step by step.

We know that together Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

First, let's say Anne has \( A \) books. Then Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books, and Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Now, let's simplify this:
\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books \( A \) is. We do this by subtracting 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to find \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Now, we need to find out how many books Fawn has. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne:
\[ Fawn = A + 12 \]
\[ Fawn = 16 + 12 \]
\[ Fawn = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg wants to make. There are 30 kids, and each kid should have 4 jello cups. So, we multiply 30 by 4:

\[ 30 \times 4 = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to know how many boxes of jello we need. Each box makes 10 jello cups. So, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of jello cups each box makes:

\[ 120 \div 10 = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we know each box costs $1.25. To find out the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 12 \times 1.25 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 per month.
2. Madeline pays 60% of this amount, so we calculate how much Madeline pays:
   - 60% of $400 is $400 * 0.60 = $240.
3. The rest of the money, which is what Keenan pays, is $400 - $240 = $160.
4. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the amount Keenan pays by 4 to find out how much he spends per week:
   - $160 / 4 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question format.)"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Tobias had a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate some pieces on the first day, then ate 10 more pieces on the second day, and then ate some more pieces on the third day.

First, he ate 2/5 of the pizza on the first day. To find out how many pieces that is, we do:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after the first day, he had:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces left} \]

Then, he ate 10 pieces on the second day. So, after the second day, he had:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces left} \]

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we do:
\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after the third day, he had:
\[ 26 - 14 = 12 \text{ pieces left} \]

Now, to find out how many pieces he ate in total, we add up what he ate each day:
\[ 24 \text{ (first day)} + 10 \text{ (second day)} + 14 \text{ (third day)} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tobias ate a total of 48 pieces of pizza. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if not provided, the answer is 48 pieces.)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If seven bottles cost $21.00, then one bottle costs $21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00.

Next, we need to find out how much one bottle of water costs. If four bottles cost $8.00, then one bottle costs $8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda. So, 3 bottles of soda cost 3 × $3.00 = $9.00.

Also, David wants to buy 2 bottles of water. So, 2 bottles of water cost 2 × $2.00 = $4.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the soda and the cost of the water together: $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

So, the total cost for David is $13.00. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, we calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so:
   \[
   16 \times 0.03 = 0.48
   \]
   So, the total cost for 16 bolts is $0.48.

2. David started with $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the money he has left is:
   \[
   12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
   \]

So, David has $12.00 left. The correct answer is:

C. $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella earns for 12 hours, we first need to know how much she earns per hour. She earned $33 for 3 hours, so we divide $33 by 3 to find out how much she earns per hour.

\[
\text{Earnings per hour} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Now, to find out how much she earns in 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12.

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Ella would earn 132 dollars after 12 hours of dog walking. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{132}
\]"
"Paul originally had 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles, so he had:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Then, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the lost marbles from the total he had after his friend gave him more marbles:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Paul has 60 marbles left. The correct answer is:

60"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Amy is taking a history test. She got some questions right in different types of questions. Here's how many she got right:

- For the multiple-choice questions, she got 80% right. There are 10 questions, so she got \(80\% \times 10 = 8\) questions right.
- For the true/false questions, she got 90% right. There are 20 questions, so she got \(90\% \times 20 = 18\) questions right.
- For the long-answer questions, she got 60% right. There are 5 questions, so she got \(60\% \times 5 = 3\) questions right.

Now, let's see how many points she got for each type of question:

- Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so for 8 questions, she got \(8 \times 1 = 8\) points.
- Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so for 18 questions, she got \(18 \times 1 = 18\) points.
- Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so for 3 questions, she got \(3 \times 5 = 15\) points.

Now, let's add up all the points she got:
\[8 + 18 + 15 = 41\]

So, Amy scored 41 points. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. So, we do:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
   \]

2. Next, we know he sells each chicken for $50. So, the total money he gets from selling 180 chickens is:
   \[
   180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he spent on the chickens, we subtract the profit from the total money he got:
   \[
   9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. So, we need to find out how many glasses Micah sold.

First, we subtract the number of glasses Julie sold from the total:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

This means Micah and Mitchell together sold 18 glasses. Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The answer is 5.

The correct option is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if provided.)"
"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to add up the cost of her hair, manicure, and pedicure.

First, we know the cost of her hair is $400.

Next, the cost of her manicure is one-fourth of the cost of her hair. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, the cost of her pedicure is three-fourths of the cost of her manicure. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hair} + \text{Cost of manicure} + \text{Cost of pedicure} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]"
"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 per meter. So, she gets:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Sarah wants to use this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{40 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters} \]

Since she can only buy whole meters of the new rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[ 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money she has:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Sarah will have 1 dollar left over. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{A} \] (Assuming A is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if not provided, the correct answer is 1 dollar.)"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. So, Melanie is currently 8 years old because 18 - 10 = 8.

We need to find out in how many years Melanie's age will be three times her current age. Her current age is 8, so three times her current age is 3 times 8, which is 24.

To find out when Melanie will be 24 years old, we need to count from now. If she is 8 now, then in 24 - 8 = 16 years, she will be 24.

So, the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be three times her current age is 16.

The correct answer is:
16"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, each pack of bacon costs:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

She has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, each packet of chicken costs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
And the total cost for the chicken is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4. So, the total cost for the strawberries is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

She has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, each pack of apples costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
And the total cost for the apples is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the money left in her budget is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus an extra 15 minutes for the encore. We know the total time for the final concert is 65 minutes.

First, we need to find out how long her usual concerts are. Let's call the usual concert time \( x \) minutes.

The final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long because it's twice as long as usual. After the final concert, she does a 15-minute encore. So, the total time for the final concert including the encore is:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, we need to find out what \( x \) is. To do this, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo started with 200 toys. He gave some toys to friends. He gave 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has left, we need to add up the toys he gave away and then subtract that from the toys he started with.

First, let's add up the toys he gave away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Now, we subtract the toys he gave away from the toys he started with:
200 (initial toys) - 150 (toys given away) = 50 toys

So, Argo has 50 toys left. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many chimichangas the shop makes, we need to add up the chimichangas made each day.

- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 times 125, so that's 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the shop makes 500 chimichangas in total on those three days.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The singer has 50 microphones. He wants to pair them up, but 20% of them won't fit. First, we need to find out how many microphones won't fit. 

20% of 50 is calculated as follows:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]
So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs.

Now, we subtract these 10 microphones from the total 50 microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
So, 40 microphones can be paired.

To find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged, we divide the 40 pairable microphones by 2:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]
So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. Now, he sees 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we need to find out how many birds that is. 

First, we calculate 2/3 of 6:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]
So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we need to find out how many birds that is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]
So, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds:
\[ 6 \text{ (in the bushes)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34. 

The correct answer is:

"Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5 of them. So, she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, she wants to put these 50 cookies into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies go into each jar, we divide the cookies by the number of jars:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, each jar has 10 cookies. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies. Each orchid has 5 petals, and each daisy has 10 petals.

First, we calculate the total number of petals on the orchids:
- 5 orchids × 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the daisies:
- 4 daisies × 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

Now, we find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids:
- 40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The answer is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden. One-fourth of these plants are indoor plants. So, we calculate the number of indoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find out how many plants are left:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Now, we subtract the outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find out how many are flowering plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find out what percentage of the plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants. The correct answer is:

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to start by figuring out how fast a thingamabob spins. We know that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, and it spins at 121 meters per second. So, to find out how fast a thingamabob spins, we divide 121 meters per second by 11:

\[ 121 \div 11 = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now we know a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second. A whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob, so we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[ 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second. The correct answer is:

\[ \text{C} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ellen eats:
- 2 carrots
- 1 salad
- 1 yogurt

The salad costs $6.
The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know the total cost for all these items is $11.

So, the cost of 2 carrots plus the cost of the salad and the yogurt is:
\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot is $1.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week. Before the raise, he made $10 an hour, and now he makes $12 an hour because they raised his pay by $2. To find out how much he makes a week, we multiply the number of hours he works by his new hourly wage: 40 hours * $12/hour = $480. So, Mark makes $480 a week. The correct answer is C."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times because Joe paid her $6 for each time. 

Now, let's figure out how much she made from mowing lawns. Since she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times, and she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, that means she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. And she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

So, the total money she made from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6 \text{ (Joe's lawn)} + 3 \text{ (Kamala's lawn)} + 5 \text{ (Alba's lawn)} = 14 \text{ times} \]
Since each time she mowed a lawn, she made $6, the total from mowing lawns is:
\[ 14 \times 6 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

But we know she only made $80 in total. So, the money she made from selling lemonade is:
\[ 80 - 84 = -4 \text{ dollars} \]

It seems there might be a mistake because she can't make negative money. Let's check the numbers again. If she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times and each time she made $6, that's $36. If she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times and each time she made $6, that's $18. And if she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times and each time she made $6, that's $30. Adding these up:
\[ 36 + 18 + 30 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

But she only made $80, so the money she made from selling lemonade is:
\[ 80 - 84 = -4 \text{ dollars} \]

This still doesn't make sense. Let's assume she mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times. Then:
\[ 6 \times 1 + 6 \times 3 + 6 \times 5 = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the money she made from selling lemonade is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply without the original response.

Martin weighs 55 kg. Carl weighs more than Martin. Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin, so Carl weighs 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.

Christian weighs more than Carl. Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl, so Christian weighs 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.

Harry weighs less than Christian. Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

So, Harry weighs 74 kg. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John rents his car 10 times a month, and each time he rents it for 3 hours. So, in one month, he rents his car for:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets $25 for each hour he rents his car. So, his total earnings in one month are:
\[ 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

John's car payment is $500 a month. To find out how much profit he makes, we subtract his car payment from his earnings:
\[ 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes a profit of $250 a month. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Martha originally had some notebooks, and we don't know exactly how many. But we know that after buying 5 more notebooks, she has a total of 7 notebooks. So, if we take away the 5 notebooks she bought, we find out how many she had before. 

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Now, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. So, if Martha had 2 notebooks, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

So, the answer is that Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The correct option is:

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 more miles than Dijana. To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we need to add 1/5 of 50 miles to 50 miles.

First, we find out what 1/5 of 50 is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Susan made 100 cookies. She wanted to share them equally among her 6 nephews. But before she could do that, her husband took 4 cookies for himself. So, we need to find out how many cookies each nephew gets after the husband took some.

First, we subtract the 4 cookies the husband took from the 100 cookies:
\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, we need to share these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew gets, we divide 96 by 6:
\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each nephew gets 16 cookies. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step as if I'm a person with primary school level education.

We know that:
- Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
- Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
- Daniel didn't read any pages today.

First, let's find out how many pages Denise read today:
- Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel yesterday, so Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

Now, let's add up the pages each of them read:
- Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, so in total, Denise read \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so in total, Daniel read \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:
- Denise read 28 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.
- So, Denise read \(28 - 13 = 15\) more pages than Daniel.

The correct answer is that Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

William bought 5 notebooks and 1 ballpen. Each notebook costs $1.50 and each ballpen costs $0.50.

First, we calculate how much 5 notebooks cost:
- 5 notebooks × $1.50 per notebook = $7.50

Next, we calculate the cost of 1 ballpen:
- 1 ballpen × $0.50 per ballpen = $0.50

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material for small masks and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's see how much material Jo needs for small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she needs \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's see how much material Jo needs for large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she needs \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for small masks and large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

So, Jo needs \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to know how many tickets Deepa bought. She saw each of the 9 movies 3 times, so she bought:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa spent $216 on these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

The correct answer is:

**8**"
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to add up all the time he spends on different activities and then subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up all the time he spends:
10 hours (sleeping) + 8 hours (working) + 1 hour (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so to find out how much free time he has, we subtract the 19 hours he spends from 24 hours:
24 hours - 19 hours = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day. The correct answer is C."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so he has:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes left} \]

He also uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes. So, he uses:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]

This means he has:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes left} \]

Now, we add the blue and red shoe boxes left:
\[ 4 \text{ blue} + 6 \text{ red} = 10 \text{ shoe boxes left} \]

So, the number of shoe boxes left is 10. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice as many books as Sarah, so he had 18 books. But he lost 2 books, so now he has 18 - 2 = 16 books. The correct answer is 16."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. To find out how many marbles that is, we do:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
\]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Now, Dean has:

\[
30 - 6 = 24
\]

marbles left.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. So, we subtract those 10 marbles from the 24 he has left:

\[
24 - 10 = 14
\]

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Duncan's age now is 60 years. Eight years ago, Duncan was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \text{ years old} \]

We are told that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, four years ago, Adam was:
\[ \frac{52}{2} = 26 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 26 + 8 = 34 \text{ years old} \]

So, Adam will be 34 years old in 8 years. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. So, we first find out how big Farmer Smith's farm is.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to get Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find out how many acres both farms have together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres. The correct answer is C."
"Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, he completes 40 packages per hour. In an eight-hour workday, he completes 40 packages/hour × 8 hours = 320 packages. Since he gets $0.20 for each package, he earns 320 packages × $0.20/package = $64.

So, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is $64.

The correct answer is:
**D. $64**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John drinks one bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. Since 45 minutes is 3 half-hours, he drinks 3 bottles of water for the normal puzzle.

An extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal one. So, an extreme sudoku takes:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many half-hours are in 180 minutes:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour, in 180 minutes (which is 6 half-hours), he drinks:
\[ 6 \text{ bottles of water} \]

So, the number of bottles of water John drinks in that time is 6. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. He threw 20 red balloons, so he threw 2 pieces of bologna at each of those 20 red balloons. That means he used \(2 \times 20 = 40\) pieces of bologna on the red balloons.

If he used 58 pieces in total and 40 pieces were used on the red balloons, then the rest of the bologna was used on the yellow balloons. So, \(58 - 40 = 18\) pieces of bologna were used on the yellow balloons.

Since he threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find out how many yellow balloons he had by dividing the number of pieces used on yellow balloons by 3. So, \(18 \div 3 = 6\).

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The correct answer is:

B. 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we first calculate the total miles he drives in a month. He drives 100 miles each day and there are 30 days in the month, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we divide the total miles by 1000:

\[ 3000 \text{ miles} \div 1000 \text{ miles/tune-up} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, he works twice as many hours as Tuesday, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours:
\[5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}\]

So, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Julia and Nadine bought a cake that cost $11. They also bought balloons and ice cream.

First, they bought 12 balloons. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. So, for 12 balloons, they would need:
\[ \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \]
So, the balloons cost $3.

Next, they bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7. So, the ice cream cost:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

Julia and Nadine spent a total of $28. Since they combined their allowances, they each got half of $28:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine each got $14 from their mother.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops were sold in total. There are 30 students, and each student sold 10 lollipops. So, we multiply the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to know how much money was made from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8. So, we multiply the total number of lollipops by the price per lollypop:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to know how much money was spent to buy the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5. So, we multiply the total number of lollipops by the cost per lollypop:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

To find out how much money the class raised, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the money made from selling them:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's count Larry's pets step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She uses 15 cups to make cinnamon tea, so she has 27 - 15 = 12 cups left for chamomile and mint tea.

She divides these 12 cups equally between chamomile and mint tea, so she makes 12 / 2 = 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea.

Now, she divides these 27 cups into 3 rows equally. So, each row has 27 / 3 = 9 cups of tea.

Since she makes 6 cups of mint tea in total and she has 3 rows, she must have 6 / 3 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 2.

The correct answer is B."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know the sloth takes 4 hours to go down the tree, pick berries, and go back up.
2. In 8 hours, the sloth can make 2 trips because 8 hours divided by 4 hours per trip equals 2 trips.
3. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.
4. To find out how many berries the sloth picks up per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips. So, 24 berries divided by 2 trips equals 12 berries per trip.

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12 berries.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}

2. The tank loses water at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the tank loses:
   \[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

3. To find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the water lost from the initial amount in the tank:
   \[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is 2000 gallons. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has one-third of that, so:

\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has one-third of that, so:

\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we know how many mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins Andrew baked. He baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.

To find the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:

\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

To find the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:

\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add the calories from both types of pastries:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day, we need to add up all the Junebugs she picked and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the Junebugs picked each day:
- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 times 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 times 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add these numbers together:
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

Adding these step by step:
39 + 78 = 117
117 + 78 = 195
195 + 48 = 243
243 + 57 = 299

So, Rita picked a total of 299 Junebugs over 5 days.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
299 ÷ 5 = 59.8

The average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day is 59.8.

Now, let's look at the multiple-choice options for the average number of Junebugs picked per day:
A. 59

"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate how far each traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, the distance the bus traveled is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, the distance the car traveled is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus traveled, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know the total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

First, let's say Jean's age is \( J \) years. Then Paul's age is \( J + 10 \) years because Paul is 10 years older than Jean.

Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \) years.

Now, we know the total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So we can write the equation:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

So Jean is 20 years old. Now we can find Paul's age:
\[ J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And Peter's age:
\[ 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Peter is 50 years old. The correct answer is:
\[

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, that's 4 friends × 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
2. Maria also got 1 balloon for herself.
3. So, before her mom gave more balloons, they had 8 + 1 = 9 balloons in total.
4. Her mom then gave each of them 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so that's 5 people × 3 balloons = 15 balloons.
5. Adding the balloons before and after, they had 9 + 15 = 24 balloons in total.

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is 24. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total. They have 10 people donating 5 boxes each, and they also have 10 boxes already. So, we add these together:

\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to know how many tables they can use. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. So, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:

\[ 60 \text{ boxes} \div 2 \text{ boxes/table} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already have 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables they can use:

\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables} \]

So, they need 15 new tables. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Zoey and Sydney.

Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, we calculate:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, we calculate:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we add the distances they both spat:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet} = 820 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average distance, we divide the total distance by 2:
\[ \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question format.)"
"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month and then find the difference in the money they make from selling those widgets.

First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a day:
- Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, and it works 24 hours a day, so it makes \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets per day.
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, and it also works 24 hours a day, so it makes \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets per day.

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a month (30 days):
- Widgeteer 3000 makes \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) widgets in a month.
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes \(1080 \times 30 = 32400\) widgets in a month.

Now, let's calculate the money each machine makes from selling the widgets. Each widget sells for $6:
- Widgeteer 3000 makes \(43200 \times 6 = 259200\) dollars.
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes \(32400 \times 6 = 194400\) dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 259200 - 194400 = 64800 \]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much Cameron would save, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the hotel charges:
- 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay.
- 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

Cameron wants to stay from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. He decides to pay for 12 hours at 1000 pesos and then add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark.

Let's calculate the cost:
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- So, the total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we know the 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron saves, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option from the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

So, Cameron would save 250 pesos.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much hay each sheep gets. Each goat gets 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep gets 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat gets. So, we calculate it like this:

1. Twice the amount each goat gets: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
2. Then, 3 pounds less than that: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

So, each sheep gets 7 pounds of hay.

Next, we need to find out how much hay all the goats and sheep need together.

1. There are 15 goats, and each goat gets 5 pounds of hay. So, the total for the goats is: \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.
2. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep gets 7 pounds of hay. So, the total for the sheep is: \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Now, we add the total for the goats and the total for the sheep to find out how much hay Nate needs in total:

\(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John earns $50 per hour and works 6 hours. So, his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $50 on gas, he has:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

He wants to put $100 in the bank, so he has:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each, so the cost is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, he has:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he wants to buy pens that cost $25 each. With $100, he can buy:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the number of pens he can buy is 4. The correct answer is:
4"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Craig spelled out 20 words, and each word had 15 letters. So, we multiply 20 by 15 to find out how many letters Craig spelled out:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]
So, Craig spelled out 300 letters.

Craig's brother spelled out 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the 300 letters Craig spelled out:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]
So, Craig's brother spelled out 350 letters.

Now, to find out the total number of letters they both spelled out, we add Craig's letters to his brother's letters:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters they spelled out is 650. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of children in all the rows.

1. First, we know there are 8 children in each row.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. There are 5 different schools.

So, we need to find out how many children are in one school first:
- Number of children in one school = Number of children in one row × Number of rows for one school
- Number of children in one school = 8 × 7 = 56

Now, we need to find out the total number of children for all the schools:
- Total number of children = Number of children in one school × Number of schools
- Total number of children = 56 × 5 = 280

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280.

The correct answer is:
280"
"The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be used to get 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the teacher can get 900 bottles of apple juice in total.

There are 29 students in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the teacher gives away 29 students × 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles of apple juice.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the bottles given to the students from the total bottles the teacher got:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles.

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself. The correct answer is:

\boxed{842}"
"To find out how much Patty charged, we need to add up all the costs.

First, we have a fixed visit fee of $40.
Then, we calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the cost is $35 per hour. So, we multiply 2.25 by 35:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]
This is the labor cost.

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged $178.75. The correct answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. James gets 10 CDs, and each CD costs $15.
2. The total cost of the CDs before any discount is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars.
3. He gets a 40% discount, so the discount amount is \(40\% \times 150 = 0.40 \times 150 = 60\) dollars.
4. After the discount, the total cost is \(150 - 60 = 90\) dollars.
5. James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40.
6. The cost of these 5 CDs is \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
7. The money he gets from selling these CDs is $40.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jen has different types of root crops to sell:
- Yams: 6 yams at $1.5 each.
- Sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes at $2 each.
- Carrots: 4 carrots at $1.25 each.

First, we calculate how much money Jen gets from selling the yams:
- 6 yams * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we calculate how much money Jen gets from selling the sweet potatoes:
- 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20.

Then, we calculate how much money Jen gets from selling the carrots:
- 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we add up all the money she gets from selling each type of root crop:
- $9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34.

So, if Jen sells everything, she will earn $34. The correct answer is C."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long it took James to swim across the lake.

1. James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake. So, he swims:
   \[
   0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]
   It takes him:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. After swimming 12 miles, he rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. The remaining distance to swim is:
   \[
   20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]
   At half the speed, his speed is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]
   So, it takes him:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming, resting, and swimming the remaining distance:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had. So, we need to find out how many loaves seven times 70 is, and then subtract 40 from that number.

First, we calculate seven times 70:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from 490:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Cayley sells newspapers and gets a commission on each one. He gets 10% on the New York Times and 8% on the Wall Street Journal. Each New York Times costs $5 and each Wall Street Journal costs $15. He sells 6 New York Times and 10 Wall Street Journal.

First, let's find out how much commission Cayley gets from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- He gets 10% commission on each New York Times.
- So, the commission per New York Times is 10% of $5, which is 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
- He sells 6 New York Times, so the total commission from New York Times is 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's find out how much commission Cayley gets from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He gets 8% commission on each Wall Street Journal.
- So, the commission per Wall Street Journal is 8% of $15, which is 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
- He sells 10 Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from Wall Street Journal is 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Now, let's add the two amounts to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal = $3 + $12 = $15.

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo must be twice Marcus's age. That means Leo is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.

So, Leo is 42 years old. The correct answer is C."
"Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar. We need to find out how many points Azibo scored.

Let's say Azibo scored \( A \) points. Then Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points, and Dinar scored \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

The total points scored by all three is 45. So we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to think about how thick the book is and how many pages fit into that thickness.

We know that:
- 1 inch of paper has 100 pages.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.

So, if 1 inch has 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will have:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the book has 150 pages. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to figure out how many 15-minute periods there are in the time he was working.

He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 16 hours. We convert 16 hours into minutes:
16 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 960 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute periods are in 960 minutes, we divide 960 by 15:
960 minutes / 15 minutes/period = 64 periods.

Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute period, we multiply the number of periods by 30:
64 periods * 30 reports/period = 1920 reports.

So, Vince stapled 1920 reports in total. The correct answer is C."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
2. 8 hours is the same as 480 minutes.
3. One day, she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes.
4. She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

Now, let's calculate how much time she was awake:
- From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
- 7 hours is 420 minutes.
- 55 minutes is 55 minutes.
- So, 7 hours and 55 minutes is 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
- Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
- Time woke up early: 5 minutes
- Total time not sleeping: 23 + 5 = 28 minutes

Now, we subtract the time not sleeping from the total sleep time:
- Total sleep time: 480 minutes
- Time not sleeping: 28 minutes
- Actual sleep time: 480 - 28 = 452 minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24
   \]
   So, Jonathan has 24 measuring cups.

2. Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16
   \]
   So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

3. Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
   \[
   16 - 6 = 10
   \]

4. Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils:
   \[
   24 + 10 = 34
   \]

So, Jonathan has 34 utensils remaining. The correct answer is:
\[

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The hospital has 1000 beds.
2. At first, 1/5 of the beds are occupied. So, 1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds are occupied.
3. This means 1000 - 200 = 800 beds are empty.
4. Now, 50 new patients are admitted each day. In 2 weeks, there are 14 days.
5. So, 50 patients/day × 14 days = 700 patients are admitted in 2 weeks.
6. Now, the total number of occupied beds is 200 (initially) + 700 (new patients) = 900 beds.
7. Therefore, the number of empty beds is 1000 (total beds) - 900 (occupied beds) = 100 beds.

So, the number of empty beds after 2 weeks is 100. The correct answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the rest are:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]
emails that are not work emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we subtract the emails sent to her family from the total non-work emails:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. Kelly said Courtney was 20% too high. To find out how many people were really there, we need to figure out what 20% of 48 is and then subtract that from 48.

First, let's find 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Now, we subtract this from 48 to find the actual number of people:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round this to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round down because you can't have a part of a person at a concert.

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.

Now, let's look at the multiple-choice options:
A. 30
B. 35
C. 38
D. 40

2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. That means Jeffrey carried \(2 \div 2 = 1\) ball.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.
4. Now, we add up all the balls they carried:
   - Jeffrey carried 1 ball.
   - Jason carried 2 balls.
   - Jordan carried 4 balls.
   - Total = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.

So, the total number of balls the coach brought is 7.

"Let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
2. On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
3. On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes. So, the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

By the end of the third day, the total number of holes they had dug is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Now, the problem says that by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes. So, four times 10 is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

This means that by the end of the third day, the island had 40 holes. Since they had 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is 11. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. That's 70 + 70 = 140 corn chips for them together.

Collins got 15 more than Amora and Lainey. So, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, to find out the total number of corn chips, we add the chips Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:
140 (Amora and Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.

So, the total number of corn chips is 225.

"The cost of the supplies is $400. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find out how much the travel tickets cost, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and then add that to $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600.

The correct answer is:
B. $600"
"Let's solve this step by step.

We know that:
1. Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's use A for the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught, S for the number of Pokemon Stan has caught, and X for the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the third equation:

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. To find out how many Stan has caught, we use \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We know each episode is 20 minutes long. The problem says there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is half of 20, which is 10 episodes.

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode. So, we do:

\[ 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes per episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

"To find the total distance the bird flew, we need to add up the distances of each part of her journey.

1. The bird flew 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. So, the distance is:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Then, the bird flew 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. So, the distance is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flew 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. So, the distance is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, we add all these distances together to find the total distance:
\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles. The correct answer is:

"Let's count the brownies step by step.

1. Greta made 1 dozen brownies for herself. A dozen is 12, so she had 12 brownies.
2. At her office, she got 1/2 dozen brownies. Half of 12 is 6, so she got 6 more brownies.
3. At her friends' party, she got 4 dozen brownies. Four dozens is 4 times 12, which is 48 brownies.
4. During the party, they ate 1 1/2 dozen brownies. Half of 12 is 6, so 1 1/2 dozen is 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies:
- Brownies from Greta: 12
- Brownies from the office: 6
- Brownies from friends: 48
- Brownies eaten: 18

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over. The correct answer is:

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

So, the total age of all three family members is 30 years. The correct answer is:

"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to add up the time for each type of racquet.

First, let's calculate the time for the synthetic gut racquets:
- Andy has 3 synthetic gut racquets.
- It takes him 15 minutes to string each synthetic gut racquet.
- So, the total time for synthetic gut racquets is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the polyester string racquets:
- Andy has 5 polyester string racquets.
- It takes him 22 minutes to string each polyester string racquet.
- So, the total time for polyester string racquets is \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes.

Then, let's calculate the time for the hybrid sets:
- Andy has 4 hybrid sets.
- It takes him 18 minutes to string each hybrid set.
- So, the total time for hybrid sets is \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Total time = time for synthetic gut + time for polyester string + time for hybrid sets
- Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes
- Total time = 227 minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John wants to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. That makes 4 people in total. The first two phones are full price, and each of the other two phones is half price.

1. The first phone costs $600.
2. The second phone also costs $600.
3. The third phone costs half of $600, which is $600 / 2 = $300.
4. The fourth phone also costs $300, which is half of $600.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600
- Third phone: $300

"To find out how many players are in both teams combined, we start with the number of players in Carlton's team, which is 13. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so we add 7 to 13 to find out how many players are in Zeke's team.

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players. Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Carlton's team to the number of players in Zeke's team.

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to know the total length of the fence. The fence is a rectangle that is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. The total length of the fence is the perimeter of the rectangle.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

So, the perimeter is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. So, the total number of wooden slats needed is:
\[ \text{Total slats} = 2 \times \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 4 boxes in total. That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes. She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept 8 boxes. The rest she sold. To find out how many boxes she sold, we subtract the boxes she kept from the total boxes: 12 - 8 = 4 boxes. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the number of oranges she sold is 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges. 

The correct answer is B. 80 oranges."
"Let's break this down step by step.

We know that the USA has 50 states. The problem says India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we need to find out how many states India has first.

Half of the number of states in the USA is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, India has 4 more than this number:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]

So, India has 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. He earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we first need to know how much more money he needs. 

The total cost of the books is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39. Tyler has $14 saved, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing $25 by $5, which gives us $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books. The correct answer is:

C. 5"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I have a primary school education.

Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries. Robert has 30 cherries, and he has 10 more than Richard. So, Richard must have \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the cherries Richard and Robert have from the total cherries:
\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \]
So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step again, but this time in a simpler way.

Sunny sells gingerbread and apple pie. We need to find out how much money he made in two days.

**Saturday:**
- He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

**Sunday:**
- He sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's find out how many boxes he sold in total:
- Total gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the money he made:
- Each box of gingerbread costs $6, so for 25 boxes, he made 25 * $6 = $150.
- Each box of apple pie costs $15, so for 21 boxes, he made 21 * $15 = $315.

Now, we add the money he made from both days:
- Total money made: $150 (gingerbread) + $315 (apple pie) = $465

So, Sunny made $465 in two days. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She plans to be outside for 4 hours each day for 8 days. So, we need to find out how many ounces of sunscreen she will use in total and then how many bottles she needs.

First, let's find out how many hours she will be outside in total:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour, she will use:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces each bottle contains:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, so it costs 60% of $100.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.60 \times 100 = \$60 \]

So, the red car costs $60. To find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the blue car and the red car together.

\[ \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Emil is now 19 years old. We need to find out how old his dad and his brother are now.

When Emil turns 24, which is 5 years from now, his dad will be half of Emil's age. So, if Emil is 24, his dad will be:
\[ 24 \div 2 = 12 \]
So, in 5 years, Emil's dad will be 12 years old. That means Emil's dad is now:
\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, Emil's dad is now 7 years old.

Also, when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, if Emil is 24, his brother will be:
\[ 24 \div 2 = 12 \]
So, in 5 years, Emil's brother will be 12 years old. That means Emil's brother is now:
\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is now 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \]

So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 14. The correct answer is:

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, so:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up all the crawfish he caught:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Each serving of crawfish is 3 pounds. To find out how many servings he has, we divide the total amount by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know there are 30 students in Mr. Roper's class. Out of these, 20% are football players. To find out how many students that is, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the rest of the students are:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find out how many that is, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is 12. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Pat wants to fill her flower bed with flowers. Each flower takes up 1 foot of space, and there's 1.5 feet of space between each flower. Pat already has 17 flowers.

First, we need to figure out how many flowers Pat needs in total to fill the 111 feet of her flower bed.

If Pat has 17 flowers, the space they take up is:
\[ 17 \text{ flowers} \times 1 \text{ foot/flower} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The space left for the new flowers is:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} - 17 \text{ feet} = 94 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to add the space for the spaces between the new flowers. If we add 17 flowers, there will be 16 spaces between them. Each space is 1.5 feet, so:
\[ 16 \text{ spaces} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/space} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total space for the new flowers and the spaces between them is:
\[ 94 \text{ feet} + 24 \text{ feet} = 118 \text{ feet} \]

Since 118 feet is more than the 111 feet Pat has, we need to adjust. We know that 17 flowers take up 17 feet, and we need to fit the rest in the remaining space. Let's see how many more flowers we can fit.

If we take out the 17 feet of the 17 flowers, we have:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} - 17 \text{ feet} = 94 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to fit the new flowers in the 94 feet. Each new flower takes 1 foot, and each space between them takes 1.5 feet. So, if we have \( n \) new flowers, the total space they take up is:
\[ n \text{ flowers} \times 1 \text{ foot/flower} + (n-1) \text{ spaces} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/space} = 94 \text{ feet} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ n + 1.5(n-1) = 94 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 94 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 94 \]
\[ 2.5n = 95.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{95.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 38.2 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, Pat needs 38 more flowers.

Now, Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
\[ 38 - 17 = 21 \text{ flowers} \]

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost is:
\[ 21 \text{ flowers} \times 6 \text{ dollars/flower} = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Pat will spend:
\[ \boxed{126} \text{ dollars} \]

The correct answer is D."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. So, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

First, we find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in one day:
- Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.
- Edgar's brother eats half as many as Edgar, so he eats \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) pretzels a day.

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in one day by 7:
- Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day.
- In a week, he eats \( 9 \times 7 = 63 \) pretzels.

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week. The correct answer is:

**63**"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Katherine has 5 baskets, and in each basket, she wants to put 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to put 3 petunias in one basket. Each petunia costs $3.00, so:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to put 2 sweet potato vines in one basket. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total cost for one basket:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the total cost for one basket by 5:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

So, Katherine will spend \$70.00 to fill all 5 baskets.

The correct answer is:

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, they use:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with 30 pounds of soil. After using 27 pounds, they have:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is 3. The correct answer is:

"Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month. She saves 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how much she saves each month for shoes:
- 25% of $2,000.00 is $500.00.

Now, let's find out how much she saves in a year:
- $500.00 per month times 12 months equals $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so to find out how many pairs she can buy, we divide the total amount she saves by the cost of one pair of shoes:
- $6,000.00 divided by $1,000.00 equals 6 pairs.

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The correct answer is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute, so we divide 90 by 6:

\[ 90 \div 6 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so we need to find out how long it takes to sauté 90 shrimp. We can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ shrimp}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{90 \times 10}{30} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to sauté:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take her 45 minutes to peel and sauté 90 shrimp. The correct answer is:

"Let's think through this step by step:

1. The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees every hour on low.
2. It ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.
3. Then it was set to high, which cools the room by 3 degrees every hour.
4. It ran on high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.
5. After that, it was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up by 2 degrees every hour during this time.
6. So, the room warmed up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's add up all the cooling and warming:
- Cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Warming: \(4\) degrees.

So, the net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

The room is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature. But the question asks how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is. So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw it. So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet the second time.
3. Since the comet comes around every 75 years, Bill saw it the second time 75 years after he saw it the first time.
4. So, if Bill was 90 years old the second time, he must have been \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time. The correct answer is:

"Buford writes checks for different things every month. Let's count them one by one:

- He writes a check for the electric bill once a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks.
- He writes a check for the gas bill once a month. So, he writes 12 gas bill checks.
- He writes a check to the church twice a month. So, he writes 2 checks each month. Over 12 months, that's 2 times 12, which is 24 church checks.
- He writes a check for the pest and lawn service every 3 months. So, in a year, he writes 4 of these checks.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total checks = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. So, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane. That means the first plane makes:

\[ 44 \times 2 = 88 \text{ trips in a day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these trips are to France. The problem tells us that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the rest are split equally between France and Germany. So, the rest of the flights are:

\[ 88 - \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \text{ trips} \]

These 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of trips to France is:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

But we need to check the answer again because the problem states the first plane's trips are split equally between France and Germany, and the rest go to Greece. So, the correct split is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \text{ trips to France} \]

Therefore, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is 22. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know:
- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
- Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the total time they howl:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total time = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 120 seconds to minutes:
- 120 seconds ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The correct answer is B."

4. This means the total age of Helene and Wilfred is \(20 - 7 = 13\) years.
5. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
6. The average age of the group is \(20 \div 4 = 5\) years.
7. So, Helene is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) years old.

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the church got:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50. The correct answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's think about how we can divide the watermelon fairly among the family.

We have 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult should get a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice. Let's say each kid gets a slice of watermelon that is \( x \) units. Then, each adult gets \( 2x \) units.

Now, we need to find out how much of the watermelon each adult gets in total. If each kid gets \( x \) units, then 4 kids together get \( 4x \) units. Each adult gets \( 2x \) units, so 2 adults together get \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) units.

So, the total amount of watermelon is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total watermelon is \( 8x \) units. Each adult gets \( 4x \) units, which is half of the total watermelon.

To find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} \times 100 = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find out when she should start, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The correct answer is:
**B. 2:00 pm**"
"Lisa and Peter sold chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. We need to find out how many chocolate bars are in one box.

First, let's add the number of boxes they sold together:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \]

This means they sold 8 boxes of chocolate bars in total. Since they sold 64 chocolate bars, we can find out how many are in one box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"To find out how much the dance studio earns in a month, we need to calculate the cost for each session and then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

First, let's find out the cost for one session:
- The cost to rent the studio is $25.
- The cost for 10 students is $1.50 each, so for 10 students it's \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- So, the total cost for one session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Now, we know the studio rents the studio 3 days a week. So, in one week, the cost is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

If a month has 4 weeks, then the total cost for the month is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480.

The correct answer is C. $480."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. So, if we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes, we get the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter.

\[ 4p = 64 \]

To find \( p \), we divide 64 by 4:

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. So, if we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes, we get the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha.

\[ 7m = 56 \]

To find \( m \), we divide 56 by 7:

\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{B}\) (assuming B is the correct option for 8 in a multiple-choice format)."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. We start with 50 porcupines in the park.
2. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]
   So, there are 30 female porcupines.
3. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   30 \times 4 = 120
   \]
4. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]
5. Now, we add the babies born in a year to the original number of porcupines:
   \[
   50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

So, after a year, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park. The correct answer is:

\boxed{1490}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how many gallons of water the pool needs. The pool company told us to measure the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.

The pool is 25 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 4 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to find out how many gallons this is. The pool company said to multiply the volume by 5.9:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's do this multiplication:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon. So, we multiply the number of gallons by $0.10:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's do this multiplication:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

The correct answer is **D**."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Two friends are playing with sticks. They have 9 red sticks. They also have 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, they have 9 (red) + 5 = 14 blue sticks. Now, they have 3 less yellow sticks than blue sticks, so they have 14 (blue) - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find out how many sticks they have in total, we add the red, blue, and yellow sticks together:
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34 sticks.

So, they have 34 sticks in total. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate how far each of them traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, the distance Matteo traveled is:
\[ 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. So, the distance Shandy traveled is:
\[ 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"To find out how many female students are at the school, we can follow these steps:

1. The school has 3000 students in total.
2. Half of these students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 is:
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male. So, the number of male students over 16 is:
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]
4. The rest are female students over 16. So, the number of female students over 16 is:
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]
5. The other half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 is:
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]
6. Half of the students under 16 are male. So, the number of male students under 16 is:
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]
7. The rest are female students under 16. So, the number of female students under 16 is:
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]
8. To find the total number of female students, we add the female students over 16 and under 16:
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

So, the total number of female students at the school is 1875. The correct answer is C."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so the difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

The correct answer is:
5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a tank that can hold 18000 gallons of water. Wanda and Ms. B are working to fill the tank in two days.

On the first day:
- Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B fills 3/4 as much as Wanda.
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- So, the total water filled on the first day is:
  \[
  4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

On the second day:
- Wanda fills 2/3 of what she filled on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B fills 1/3 of what she filled on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- So, the total water filled on the second day is:
  \[
  3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Now, let's add the water filled over the two days:
\[
7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

The tank's total capacity is 18000 gallons. So, the remaining water needed to fill the tank is:
\[
18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons. The correct answer is:

\boxed{6000}"
"Let's solve this step by step.

Maria's power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank has:
\[ 100\% - 9\% = 91\% \]
of its original charge left. So, after 5 hours, the power bank has:
\[ 91\% \times C = 0.91C \]
where \( C \) is the original charge.

Then, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after another 3 hours, the power bank has:
\[ 91\% \times 0.93 = 0.91 \times 0.93 \]
of its original charge left. We know that after these 8 hours, the power bank has 28% of its original charge left. So:
\[ 0.91 \times 0.93 = 0.28 \]
Let's calculate \( 0.91 \times 0.93 \):
\[ 0.91 \times 0.93 = 0.8503 \]
So, we have:
\[ 0.8503C = 0.28 \]
To find \( C \), we divide both sides by 0.8503:
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.8503} \approx 0.329 \]
So, the original charge of the power bank was about 32.9%.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the correct option for 32.9%)"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for the car, we first need to know how much she earns each week. She earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Janet wants to save 20% of $10,000 for the car. So, we calculate 20% of $10,000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The correct answer is:

"Jamaar has $10 to spend. He has already bought some fruits, and we need to find out how much money he has left to buy plums.

First, let's see how much he spent on each type of fruit:
- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the money he has left is:
Money left = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The correct answer is:
3"
"Anne bought a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself. So, the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

She has 10 friends, and she wants to give the 13 packs equally to her friends. So, we divide the 13 packs by 10 friends:

13 packs ÷ 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate how many pieces each friend gets:

1.3 packs × 60 pieces per pack = 78 pieces per friend

So, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets. The correct answer is:

\boxed{78}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We start with the price of carrots being $120. Every year, the price increases by 5%. We need to find out how much the price will be after 3 years.

First, let's find out what 5% of $120 is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{5}{100} \times 120 = 0.05 \times 120 = 6 \]

So, the price increases by $6 each year.

Now, let's calculate the price after each year:

1. After the first year:
\[ 120 + 6 = 126 \]

2. After the second year:
\[ 126 + 6 = 132 \]

3. After the third year:
\[ 132 + 6 = 138 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years is $138.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook. She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. We know that 3 of the albums are for selfies and 2 are for portraits. We need to find out how many selfies and portraits she has.

First, let's see how many pictures are in each album. Since she has 72 pictures and 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:
\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]
So, each album has 9 pictures.

Now, we know 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. So, we can find out how many selfies and portraits there are by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures in each album.

For selfies:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

For portraits:
\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Now, to find out the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

So, Olivia has 45 selfies and portraits combined. But the question asks for the number of selfies and portraits separately, not the total. So, the number of selfies is 27 and the number of portraits is 18.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{27 \text{ selfies and } 18 \text{ portraits}} \]

Since the question asks for the total number of selfies and portraits, the correct option would be:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the option for 45)"

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early. So, we subtract 24 from 100:

4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, we add 30 to 61:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a person with primary school level education.

We have a quiz with 60 questions. Here's how we can figure out how many questions Aries is sure to get right.

1. First, we need to find out how many questions are easy. The problem says 40% of the questions are easy.
   - 40% of 60 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of } 60 = \frac{40}{100} \times 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
     \]
   So, there are 24 easy questions.

2. Aries is sure to get 75% of these easy questions right. So, we calculate 75% of 24:
   - 75% of 24 is:
     \[
     75\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{75}{100} \times 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18
     \]
   So, Aries is sure to get 18 easy questions right.

3. Now, we need to find out how many questions are average and difficult. Since the rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, we first find out how many questions are not easy:
   - Total questions - Easy questions = Average and difficult questions
   - 60 - 24 = 36
   So, there are 36 questions that are either average or difficult.

4. Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, we divide 36 by 2:
   - Average questions = Difficult questions = \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\)

5. Aries is sure to get half of these average and difficult questions right. So, we calculate half of 18:
   - Half of 18 is:
     \[
     \frac{18}{2} = 9
     \]
   So, Aries is sure to get 9 average questions and 9 difficult questions right.

6. Now, we add up all the questions Aries is sure to get right:
   - Easy questions right + Average questions right + Difficult questions right
   - 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

So, Aries is sure to get 36 questions right. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Today, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned a total of $120.

First, let's find out how much money Teresa made from selling large stuffed animals. If she sold twice as many small ones as large ones, and the total earnings are $120, we can figure out how much she made from the large ones.

Let's say she sold \( x \) large stuffed animals. Then she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it's \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

The total money from large stuffed animals is \( x \times 12 \).

The total money from small stuffed animals is \( 2x \times 4 = 8x \).

So, the total money she made is:
\[ x \times 12 + 8x = 120 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, she sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals she sold is \( 12 \).

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, we need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of sandwiches they eat in one day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day × 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Suzanne sold cookies and cupcakes and then gave some money to her sisters. We need to find out how much money she has left.

First, let's see how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes:
- She sold 80 cookies at $1 each. So, she made \(80 \times 1 = \$80\).
- She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each. So, she made \(60 \times 4 = \$240\).

Now, let's add these amounts to find out her total earnings:
- Total earnings = $80 (from cookies) + $240 (from cupcakes) = $320.

Next, Suzanne gave $10 to each of her two sisters. So, she gave away \(2 \times 10 = \$20\).

Now, let's find out how much money she has left:
- Money left = Total earnings - Money given to sisters = $320 - $20 = $300.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. First, we need to know how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. The problem tells us that with an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than that. So, we need to find 50% of 12 pounds and add it to 12 pounds.

   50% of 12 pounds is calculated as:
   \[
   0.5 \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   Adding this to 12 pounds gives:
   \[
   12 + 6 = 18 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 18 pounds of ore per day.

2. Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. Since each dwarf can mine 18 pounds per day, 40 dwarves can mine:
   \[
   40 \times 18 = 720 \text{ pounds}

"To find out how much the package with 8 sandwiches costs, we need to know how much each sandwich costs first. We know that:

- 2 sandwiches cost $3, so each sandwich costs $3 ÷ 2 = $1.5.
- 4 sandwiches cost $6, so each sandwich still costs $6 ÷ 4 = $1.5.

Since the price is proportional, we can use the price per sandwich to find the cost of 8 sandwiches. If each sandwich costs $1.5, then 8 sandwiches will cost 8 × $1.5 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

The correct answer is C. $12."

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{10}{100} \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The correct answer is:

C. $200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
2. A gust of wind bursts 40% of the red balloons. So, 40% of 25 red balloons burst:
   \[
   0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst}
   \]
   This means the number of red balloons left is:
   \[
   25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons}
   \]
3. Sally then accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons. So, half of 12 yellow balloons are released:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released}
   \]
   This means the number of yellow balloons left is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons}
   \]
4. Sally finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her collection. So, 75% of 8 blue balloons are added:
   \[
   0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added}
   \]
   This means the total number of balloons Sally carries into the school is:
   \[
   15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 34 \text{ balloons}
   \]

So, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is 34. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}
\]"
"To find out the chance that Marcus has to turn in his homework, we need to look at all the different ways he might have to do it.

1. If there's a substitute teacher, there's a 50% chance he'll have to turn in his homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension, so that's 60% chance he won't get an extension and has to turn it in.
3. If he doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance he can convince the teacher his dog ate his homework, so that's 80% chance he still has to turn it in.

Now, let's add up all the chances he has to turn it in:
- 50% chance with a substitute teacher
- 60% chance with the normal teacher (since 100% - 40% = 60%)
- 80% chance with the normal teacher (since 100% - 20% = 80%)

So, the total chance is 50% + 60% + 80% = 190%.

Since probabilities can't be more than 100%, we need to adjust this. The 50% chance with the substitute teacher and the 60% chance with the normal teacher add up to 110%, which means we need to adjust the 80% chance with the normal teacher to fit within the 100% limit. 

So, the correct chance is 50% + 60% = 110% - 20% = 100%.

Therefore, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100%.

The correct answer is:
**A. 100%**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people. There are 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty. So, we need to find out how many seats are left for the graduates and their friends and family.

First, we add the seats for graduates and faculty:
\[ 950 + 300 = 1250 \]

Now, we subtract these seats from the total capacity to find out how many seats are left:
\[ 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \]

There are 950 graduates, and we need to split the remaining 4750 seats equally among them. To find out how many tickets each graduate gets, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
\[ 4750 \div 950 = 5 \]

So, each graduate gets 5 tickets. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"To find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know that 75 large jelly beans can fill Grandpa up.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large ones. So, he can eat \(2 \times 75 = 150\) medium-sized jelly beans.
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. So, to find out how many small jelly beans he can eat, we need to multiply the number of medium-sized jelly beans by 3. That means \(150 \times 3 = 450\) small jelly beans.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}
\]

(Note: In a multiple-choice format, the correct answer would be represented by the letter corresponding to the correct option, which is not provided in the question. Here, I've represented it as \(\boxed{D}\) as an example, but in a real scenario, you would need to replace \(D\) with the actual correct letter option.)"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Melissa makes. She gets paid $15 each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she spends on parking. She pays $3 each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after paying for parking, we subtract the parking cost from her earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much she makes per hour, we divide her net earnings by the total hours she worked:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes 2 dollars per hour after expenses. The correct answer is:

2"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Ted starts with $200. He buys 3 books, and each book costs $16. So, the total cost for the books is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, he buys 3 pencils, and each pencil costs $6. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much Ted spent in total, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Ted spent a total of $66. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"Richard wants to make a video of a science experiment where he drops a specific branded candy into a bottle of diet soda every 3 feet along his driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, so he needs to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. This means he needs 8 bottles of soda because 24 divided by 3 is 8.

After starting at the first bottle, Richard needs to go from one bottle to the next. It takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy. Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

So, the total time it will take him is 7 intervals times 5 seconds per interval, which is 35 seconds.

The total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \boxed{35} seconds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Uncle Franky has two boxes of apples. Each box has 40 apples. So, if we add the apples from both boxes, we get:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} + 40 \text{ apples/box} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Now, Uncle Franky wants to pack these apples into packs of 8 apples each. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese, and it costs $11 per pound. So, for 2 pounds, it will cost:
\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese, and it costs $6 per pound. So, for 3 pounds, it will cost:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
\[ 22 + 18 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the amount she started with:
\[ 50 - 40 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Amor will have 10 dollars left to buy meat. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jim borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years. So, the total amount borrowed is:
   \[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

2. Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 a year. After college, his job pays triple that, so:
   \[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

3. If Jim worked for 4 years in college and 4 years after college, he would have earned:
   \[ 75,000 \times 8 = 600,000 \]

4. But he also borrowed $200,000 during his college years, so he needs to earn back this amount plus the money he didn't earn while in school:
   \[ 600,000 - 200,000 = 400,000 \]

5. To find out how long it will take him to earn $400,000 at his new job pay of $75,000 a year, we divide:
   \[ \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{400}{75} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

Since Jim can't work a fraction of a year, he needs to work 6 years to earn enough money.

The answer is:
**6 years**"
"Jim's bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs fabric that is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the fabric for each piece will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

To find out how much fabric he needs for one piece, we multiply the length by the width:
\[ 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since he needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \, \text{square feet} \times 2 = 160 \, \text{square feet} \]

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.
2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters. To find one-fifth of Monday's letters:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
   \]
   Then add 17:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, they delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.
3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice Tuesday's letters. First, find twice Tuesday's letters:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then add 5:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, they delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up all the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[
425 + 102 + 209 = 736
\]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

The correct answer is:

"To find out how much Molly will pay, we need to add up the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad.
- Each person's chicken salad costs $6.50.
- So, the total cost for chicken salad is \(10 \times 6.50 = 65\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad.
- Each person's pasta salad costs $6.
- So, the total cost for pasta salad is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of chicken salad + Cost of pasta salad
- Total cost = 65 + 36 = 101 dollars.

So, the total amount Molly will pay is 101 dollars. The correct answer is C."
"Let's solve this step by step as if you're a primary school student.

1. In the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice what he lost in the first race. So, twice what he lost is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Adding $1 to that gives \(10 + 1 = 11\). So, he won $11 in the second race.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times what he won in the second race. So, \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\). He lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's add up all the money lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won, so no money lost)
- Third race: $16.5

Total money lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find out how much he lost on average, we divide the total money lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average money lost per race: \(21.5 \div 3 = 7.1667\)

So, the average amount lost per race is $7.1667. 

If we had to choose the closest option from the choices given, it would be $7.17 (which is the closest to $7.1667).

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}

"To find out how many people live in South America, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities. So, we need to find out how many cities there are in total.

1. Calculate the total number of cities:
   - Number of countries = 26
   - Cities per country = 5
   - Total cities = 26 countries × 5 cities per country = 130 cities

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people living in it. So, to find the total number of people in all the cities, we multiply the total number of cities by the number of people in each city.

2. Calculate the total number of people:
   - Total cities = 130
   - People per city = 1000
   - Total people = 130 cities × 1000 people per city = 130,000 people

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to know their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference in their heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{A} \] (Assuming A is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if provided.)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have three people dividing $1920. Let's say the first person gets \( x \) dollars. The second person gets $80 more than the first person, so they get \( x + 80 \) dollars. The third person gets twice what the second person gets, so they get \( 2(x + 80) \) dollars.

The total amount they get together is $1920. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now, let's simplify this equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, we need to find out what \( x \) is. We do this by subtracting 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person gets $420. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{A}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked. They worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days. So, for 3 weeks, they worked:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. So, for 21 days, the total number of days they worked is:
\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours they worked in total. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours they worked is:
\[ 7.875 \times 24 = 190.5 \text{ hours} \]

There are 4 painters, so each painter worked:
\[ \frac{190.5}{4} = 47.625 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in 47.625 hours of work. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]

(Note: The correct answer in the multiple-choice format is represented by the letter D, but since the actual numerical answer is 47.625, the letter D is used to indicate the format of the multiple-choice question.)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. Let's say he retrieved \( x \) balls in the second set. According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls from all three sets:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, let's combine the terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To make it easier, let's convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[ 2x = \frac{4x}{2} \]
\[ \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]
\[ \frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

Now, let's subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 15 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, let's find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007. The car loses 21% of its value each year. We need to find out how much the car is worth in 2010.

First, let's see how much the car loses in one year:
- The car loses 21% of $20,000.
- 21% of $20,000 is calculated as \( 20,000 \times 0.21 = 4,200 \).
- So, the car is worth \( 20,000 - 4,200 = 15,800 \) in 2008.

Next, let's see how much it loses in the next year (from 2008 to 2009):
- The car loses 21% of $15,800.
- 21% of $15,800 is calculated as \( 15,800 \times 0.21 = 3,318 \).
- So, the car is worth \( 15,800 - 3,318 = 12,482 \) in 2009.

Finally, let's see how much it loses in the next year (from 2009 to 2010):
- The car loses 21% of $12,482.
- 21% of $12,482 is calculated as \( 12,482 \times 0.21 = 2,621.22 \).
- So, the car is worth \( 12,482 - 2,621.22 = 9,860.78 \) in 2010.

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78.

The correct answer is C. $9,860.78."
"To find out how many Spanish books there are, we first need to know how many books are in English and how many are in German.

There are 50 books in total.

Half of them are in English, so:
\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

10% of them are in German, so:
\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find out how many are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

The correct answer is:

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.
2. In 30 days, she drinks \(8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups}\).
3. We know that 16 cups make up 1 gallon.
4. So, to find out how many gallons 240 cups make, we divide 240 by 16: \(240 \div 16 = 15\).

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The correct answer is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people get off the train. Twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) people, get on the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people get off the train.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Alison bought different things for her running team:

1. A tank top for $10.
2. Running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top. So, the shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. Tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. So, the shoes cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. Athletic socks that were $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off. So, the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear. The correct answer is:

\boxed{D} (assuming D is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format)"
"To find out how much it will cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to figure out how many tiles we need and then multiply that by the cost of each tile.

The kitchen floor is 200 square feet big, and each tile is 1 square foot. So, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400.

The correct answer is C. $2400."
"To find out how much James pays for insurance in a year, we first need to know how much more the insurance cost because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it's 60% more than normal.

First, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{60}{100} \times 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the cost because of the accident is $72 more than the normal $120. Now, we add this to the normal cost to get the total cost per month:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

This means James pays $192 a month for insurance. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Greg needs to wash sheets for:
- 4 twin beds
- 1 king size bed

Each load of laundry can wash:
- 2 twin sets of sheets
- 1 king set of sheets

First, we calculate how many loads Greg needs for the twin beds:
- He has 4 twin beds.
- Each load washes 2 twin sets.
- So, he needs \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads for the twin beds.

Next, we calculate how many loads he needs for the king size bed:
- He has 1 king size bed.
- Each load washes 1 king set.
- So, he needs \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load for the king size bed.

Now, we add the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Loads for twin beds: 2
- Loads for king size bed: 1
- Total loads: \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) loads per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly loads by 52:
- Total loads per year: \( 3 \times 52 = 156 \) loads.

So, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{156}

"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step:

1. They watch 4 movies on Saturday.
2. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, so they watch \(4 \div 2 = 2\) movies on Sunday.
3. In one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch \(4 + 2 = 6\) movies.
4. Since there are 4 weekends in 4 weeks, they watch \(6 \times 4 = 24\) movies in 4 weeks.

So, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers. So, before last year, he had 100 stickers, and after collecting 50 more, he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers he collected last year. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so this year he collected 2 × 50 = 100 stickers.
4. Now, we add the stickers he had before last year and the stickers he collected this year: 150 (from last year) + 100 (this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to know how much cat food the cats eat in total each day.

Each cat eats 60 grams twice a day, so each cat eats:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since there are 3 cats, the total amount of cat food eaten by all cats in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the amount eaten in one day:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{B} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Becky ate 10 slices. Jake ate 3 slices less than Becky, so:
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we add up all the slices they ate:
\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Donovan's part took some time, and Betsy's part took 18 minutes more than Donovan's part. The total time for both parts is 98 minutes.

If we let the time Donovan's part took be \( D \) minutes, then Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time is:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up all the costs mentioned:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300 for 30 minutes, which is half of $300, so it's $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4 each is $4 times 30, which is $120.
4. The cost of parking for 2 hours at $6 per hour is $6 times 2, which is $12.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[ 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

James gets 80 emails a day. Out of these, 20% don't need a response. So, we need to find out how many emails do need a response.

First, we calculate 20% of 80 emails:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails} \]

So, 16 emails don't need a response. That means the rest of the emails do need a response:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

James responds to these 64 emails each day. Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320 \text{ emails} \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\] (Assuming the multiple-choice options were provided as A, B, C, D, and the correct answer was C.)"
"To find out how many classes visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so that's 2 times 32, which is 64 classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so that's 3 times 32, which is 96 classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday)

First, add 32 and 64:
32 + 64 = 96

Next, add 96 to 96:
96 + 96 = 192

Then, add 192 and 30:
192 + 30 = 222

Finally, add 222 and 25:
222 + 25 = 247

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

The correct answer is:

John's scores are:
- First 3 tests: 100, 100, 100
- 4th test: 80

First, let's add up all the scores:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

John took 4 tests in total. To find the average, we divide the total score by the number of tests:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, they ate:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]
This means they have:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
They ate 80% of their pizzas, so they ate:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]
This means they have:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Now, to find out how many pizzas are left in total, we add the pizzas left from both groups:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas left} \]

So, the number of pizzas left is 14. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Anthony wants to send out coupons. He wants to send 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. So, he will send 1400 big coupons.

Now, each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he has 700 small coupons. So, the cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he has 1400 big coupons. So, the cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Anthony spends 245 dollars on postage. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]

2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's subs, so Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 subs left.
3. Then Sidney ordered 3 more subs, so she had 3 + 3 = 6 subs in total.
4. Each sub has 4 meatballs, so 6 subs would have 6 × 4 = 24 meatballs.

So, the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 24.

Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck carried 20 tons of fertilizer. But two hours after the trucks left, 5 trucks had problems and couldn't deliver the fertilizer. So, the number of trucks that could deliver the fertilizer is:

20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertilizer. So, the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers is:

15 trucks × 20 tons per truck = 300 tons

So, the total number of tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons. The correct answer is C."

Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants. The store has a promotion where you get 1 pound of butter for half off if you buy 1 pound. The regular price for butter is $4.00 per pound.

First, let's see how many sets of 2 pounds Dennis can get with the promotion:
- For every 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound.
- So, for 2 pounds, he pays $4.00.
- For 4 pounds, he pays $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.
- For 6 pounds, he pays $4.00 + $4.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

So, Dennis will pay $12.00 for 6 pounds of butter.

The correct answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of:
   - 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people invited.

2. But 4 people couldn't come, so the number of people who will come is:
   - 45 - 4 = 41 people.

3. The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 people. For the 41 people, we need to add the cost for the extra 21 people. Each extra person costs $6, so:
   - 21 extra people * $6 per person = $126.

4. Now, we add the base fee to the extra cost:
   - $125 (base fee) + $126 (extra cost) = $251.

So, the total cost for the party is $251. The correct answer is:

\boxed{B} (assuming B is the correct option in a multiple-choice format)"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Maggie had $60 and she spent a quarter of it. A quarter of $60 is $15. So, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza also had $60 and she spent one-third of it. One-third of $60 is $20. So, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Now, to find out how much money they have left together, we add what Maggie has left to what Riza has left:
$45 + $40 = $85

So, the total amount of money they have left is $85.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas. He needs these bananas to feed his three monkeys for a week. We know that one monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week, one monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we add the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles has is 315. So, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the third monkey eats these bananas over 7 days, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day. The correct answer is:

Now, if we add the pieces from both puzzles together, Teddy put 250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces in total.

So, the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 750. The correct answer is C."
"Jenny wants to buy 15 roses, and each rose costs $2. So, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny has five $5 bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Jenny needs $5 more to buy the roses because:

\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

The florist gives change in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters Jenny gets is:

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, she has saved 120 toothpicks. She needs 200 toothpicks in total. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ 80 \div 10 = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. First, we need to find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was originally $2000, and he bought it at 75% of the price. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]
   Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

2. Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of what he paid. So, we calculate:
   \[
   1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]
   Mr. Rogers sold the watch for $1800.

3. Now, we need to find out how much discount Mr. Rogers' friend got. The original price was $2000, and he bought it for $1800. So, the discount is:
   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]
   The discount is $200.

4. To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount amount}}{\text{Original price}} \right) \times 100

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that one spring makes one jellyfish every second.
2. In one hour, there are 3600 seconds (60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour).
3. So, in one hour, one spring makes 3600 jellyfish.
4. Now, we need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs can make in 4 hours.
5. First, let's find out how many jellyfish 5 springs can make in one hour. Since one spring makes 3600 jellyfish in one hour, 5 springs will make \(5 \times 3600 = 18000\) jellyfish in one hour.
6. Now, we need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs can make in 4 hours. Since 5 springs make 18000 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours they will make \(18000 \times 4 = 72000\) jellyfish.

So, the number of jellyfish 5 springs can make in 4 hours is 72000. The correct answer is:

"James decided to walk to the store. When he got halfway there, he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back. The store is 4 miles away from his home.

First, he walked half the distance to the store, which is:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Then, he walked back home, which is another 2 miles.

So, the total distance he walked is:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the store and walk back home.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, we multiply the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost if she bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80. So, we multiply the total number of bananas by the cost per banana:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much it would cost if she bought the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, and she bought 10 bunches. So, we multiply the number of bunches by the cost per bunch:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming the correct answer is given as a multiple-choice option B)"

This simplifies to:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount left over for Sam is:

The correct answer is the one that matches 20 feet. If this were a multiple-choice question, the correct answer would be the option that says 20 feet."
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to know how much it grows in one year. If the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can find out how much it grows in one year by dividing 8 inches by 4 years:

\[ \text{Growth per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches each year, we can find out how much it grows in 13 years by multiplying 2 inches per year by 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marcel sells three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. He sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 150 Trekking bikes. 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so he sold 15% of 300, which is 45 BMX bikes. The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes. So, he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's find out how much money he made from each type of bike:
- Each Trekking bike costs $450, so he made 150 * $450 = $67,500 from Trekking bikes.
- Each BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB bike, which is $500 / 2 = $250, so he made 45 * $250 = $11,250 from BMX bikes.
- Each MTB bike costs $500, so he made 105 * $500 = $52,500 from MTB bikes.

Now, let's add up all the money he made:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

So, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month. The correct answer is C."

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the farmer makes:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the truck picks up:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, to find out how many bales are left, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12.

John has to go to 8 classes each day because he has 2 extra classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. So, if he goes to class 5 days a week, we need to find out how many minutes he spends in class each week and then add the extra time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find out how many minutes he spends in class each day:
- He has 8 classes each day.
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
- So, he spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

Next, let's find out how many minutes he spends in class each week:
- He goes to class 5 days a week.
- So, he spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

Now, let's find out how much extra time he spends on Saturday and Sunday:
- He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
- So, he spends \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now, let's add the time he spends in class each week to the extra time he spends on the weekend:
- He spends 1600 minutes in class each week.
- He spends 100 minutes on the weekend.
- So, he spends \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes learning each week.

Finally, let's convert the minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, he spends \(\frac{1700}{60} = 28.33\) hours learning each week.

The correct answer is 28.33 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony. Each story is 24 feet high, so the ball starts at 72 feet (3 stories * 24 feet/story).

When the ball bounces, it goes up to 2/3 of its starting height. So, we calculate 2/3 of 72 feet:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, the ball bounces again, and it goes up to 2/3 of 48 feet:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the ball goes up to 32 feet on its second bounce. The correct answer is:

C. 32 feet"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:
   \[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:
   \[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to figure out how many bags of apples they sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

1. First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples.
2. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples.
3. To find out how many bags they sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]
4. The price for each bag is $5.
5. To find out the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the orchard earned $1000. The correct answer is C."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the triceratops, so it left half of the triceratops.
2. The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, so they left half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms.

We know that after the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms left. Before the Allosaurus ate, there were twice 270 kilograms because the Allosaurus ate the last part. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms.

Now, before the velociraptors ate, there were twice 540 kilograms because the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

Before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate, there were twice 1080 kilograms because the Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of what was left. So, before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate, there were \(1080 \times 2 = 2160\) kilograms.

Therefore, the triceratops had 2160 kilograms of meat before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate.

The correct answer is A. 2160."
"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total area of all the walls. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, the east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the areas of all the walls together to get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we need to find out how many gallons of paint are needed:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to paint the room is $144. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ellen starts with 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them and leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken. Then her brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend has to choose 1 soda from the 4 sodas left. There are 2 shaken sodas and 2 unshaken sodas.

To find out the chance that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda, we need to see how many of the 4 sodas are shaken. There are 2 shaken sodas out of 4 sodas.

So, the chance is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To express this as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 50%.

The correct answer is:
**B** (This is a multiple-choice question, and the correct letter is B.)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two trains traveling in opposite directions. One train is going 60 miles per hour, and the other is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

After 3 hours, the first train will have traveled:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train will have traveled:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, the trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours. The correct answer is:

C. 270 miles"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

First, we need to find out how many days are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days. So, we add these together:

\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \text{ days} \]

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works 80% of the days. To find out how many days he works, we calculate 80% of 50 days:

\[ 50 \times 0.80 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy works 3 hours each day. So, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of hours he works each day:

\[ 40 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Billy can help 2 people each hour. So, we multiply the number of hours he works by the number of people he helps each hour:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ people/hour} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, Billy helps 240 people with their taxes. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.

So, we multiply 12 by 35:
\[ 12 \times 35 = 12 \times (30 + 5) = (12 \times 30) + (12 \times 5) = 360 + 60 = 420 \]
So, there are 420 people in the buses.

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.

So, we multiply 20 by 3:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]
So, there are 60 people in the cars.

Now, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 + 60 = 480 \]

So, the total number of people inside the church is 480.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we subtract 4 from Mike's age:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20
   \]
   So, Martha is 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to Martha's age:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30
   \]
   So, Jeff is 30 years old.

The correct answer is that Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest slide:
- The biggest slide is 300 feet long.
- People slide down at 60 feet per minute.

To find the time, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:
\[
\text{Time for the biggest slide} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest slide:
- The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.
- People slide down at 80 feet per minute.

To find the time, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:
\[
\text{Time for the second biggest slide} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The correct answer is:

\boxed{B} (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, which is not provided in the original question but is included here for the sake of following the multiple-choice format requirement.)"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Bobby has a lunch break that is 30 minutes long and two 15-minute breaks. So, his total break time per day is:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Two breaks: 15 minutes each, so 15 + 15 = 30 minutes

Adding these together, his total break time per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes his breaks add up to in 5 days:
- 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
- 300 minutes ÷ 60 = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours. The correct answer is:

5"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we calculate:

\[ 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance they all ran together is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles Amber and Micah ran from the total:

\[ 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sheila started with $85.00 on her card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00. So, we subtract $15.00 from $85.00:
   \[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]
   Now, Sheila's card balance is $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the sale price, we calculate 20% of $20.00 and subtract it from $20.00:
   \[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]
   So, the sale price of the frying pan is:
   \[ 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the sale price, we calculate 10% of $30.00 and subtract it from $30.00:
   \[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]
   So, the sale price of the towels is:
   \[ 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]
5. Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance on the card:
   \[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her card is $113.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct option in a multiple-choice format, as the original response did not specify the format.)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light. We also know that 6 jellyfish change color when the UV light is turned on. 

First, let's find out how many large jellyfish there are. If a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and 6 of them change color, then:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ of the large jellyfish} = 6 \]
So, the total number of large jellyfish is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since the large jellyfish make up a fifth of the total jellyfish, we can find the total number of jellyfish by:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \text{ of the total jellyfish} = 18 \]
So, the total number of jellyfish is:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\] (Assuming A is the correct answer option in a multiple-choice question, if such a question was provided.)"
"Okay, let me explain it simply without using big words.

Chris is 4 years old. Ben is older than Chris, and he is twice as old as Chris. So, Ben is 4 times 2, which is 8 years old.

Now, Caroline is older than Ben, and she is three times as old as Ben. So, Caroline is 8 times 3, which is 24 years old.

So, Caroline is 24 years old. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to figure out how much money she needs to save for her retirement and how much she saves each year.

Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary in retirement. Her current salary is $100,000, so her annual living expenses in retirement will be:
\[ 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000 \]

She plans to save for 20 years, so the total amount she needs to save is:
\[ \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000 \]

Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary. Her annual salary is $100,000, so her annual savings are:
\[ 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000 \]

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings:
\[ \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years} \]

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

The correct answer is:
**40 years**"
"To find out how long each final cut will be, let's break it down step by step:

1. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon.
2. He cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   100 \div 4 = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each part is 25 centimeters long.
3. Now, each of these 25 centimeter parts is cut into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each final part, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each final part is 5 centimeters long.

Therefore, the length of each final cut will be 5 centimeters. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
(Note: In a multiple-choice format, B would be the correct letter option, but since the actual numerical answer is 5 cm, the boxed answer is 5 cm.)"
"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to know the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the students are boys and there are 240 boys. So, if 40% of the total students is 240, we can find the total number of students by dividing 240 by 0.40.

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

Now that we know there are 600 students in total, we can find out how many of them are girls. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 \times 0.60 = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simple way.

My mom bought two things:
1. A set of pots for $19.
2. A sack of garden soil for $26.

So, the total cost of these two things is:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Then, she used a coupon that gave her $7 off. So, we subtract $7 from $45:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

Therefore, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.

The correct answer is:

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up the heights of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

We have:
- 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Now, we add these together to get the total height of all the heels:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

There are a total of \(3 + 3 = 6\) women, so we divide the total height by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the average height of the heels is 3 inches.

The correct answer is:
C. 3 inches"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simple way.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. She plans to hike 125 miles each time she goes out, and she plans to go out twice a day. So, each day she plans to hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, to finish her hike in 30 days, she needs to hike:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, she needs to hike:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ more miles/day} \]

So, the number of more miles per day Soledad must hike is 60 miles.

"To find out how much the store will have received after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total money made from selling each color of ball and then add them all together.

First, let's calculate the money made from selling the red balls:
- There are 3 red balls.
- Each red ball costs $9.
- So, the money from red balls is \(3 \times 9 = 27\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the money made from selling the blue balls:
- There are 11 blue balls.
- Each blue ball costs $5.
- So, the money from blue balls is \(11 \times 5 = 55\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the money made from selling the green balls:
- There are 25 green balls.
- Each green ball costs $3.
- So, the money from green balls is \(25 \times 3 = 75\) dollars.

Now, we add up the money from all the balls:
- Money from red balls: $27
- Money from blue balls: $55
- Money from green balls: $75

Total money made = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

So, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. We need to find out how much apples each of them wants and then see how much is left for James.

Pierre wants a quarter of the apples:

Paul wants one-third of the apples:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, let's add the apples Pierre and Paul want:
\[
3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

The total amount of apples they bought is 12 kg. So, the apples left for James are:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Amalia mowed the lawn and it took her 4 hours. Megan had to walk the dog, and that took her 2 hours more than Amalia. So, Megan's time was 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours. Dior did laundry, and that took her more than 4 hours. We can say Dior took 12 hours because it's more than 4 hours plus 4 hours, which is 8 hours.

Now, we add up all the hours:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 12 hours

So, the total time they all took is 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 22 hours."

   140 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 280 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, John drives 280 miles each month when visiting his parents. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

The problem says that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if we let \( B \) be the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we can write:
\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have 400 toys to make.
2. We have 5 workers.
3. 2 workers make 6 toys each hour.
4. Another 2 workers make 4 toys each hour.
5. They all work for 10 hours.
6. At the end of the 10 hours, they still need 20 toys to finish the order.

First, let's see how many toys the first 4 workers make in 10 hours:

- The first 2 workers make 6 toys each hour, so together they make \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next 2 workers make 4 toys each hour, so together they make \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Together, the first 4 workers make \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.
- In 10 hours, they make \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

Now, we know they need 400 toys in total and they have 20 toys left to make, so they need to make \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since they made 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have made \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, we divide 180 by 10:

\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

So, the fifth worker makes \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the weights of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add Kory's dog to Elijah's dogs:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So if Seth had \( S \) stickers, Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris got \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
4. So, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \). To find \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"John has 3 large bags of M&Ms, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. So, the total weight of M&Ms is 30 ounces. If 1 ounce of M&Ms has 30 M&Ms, then 30 ounces will have:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, John can make 90 small bags. The correct answer is:

**90**"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out what half of the Earth's circumference is. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

2. Now, we know Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth. The correct answer is:
\[

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we calculate the speed of the second fastest car:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

We know that two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then we can write the equation:
\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. Now, we need to find out how old Vince is now. Since two years have passed, we add 2 to Vince's age two years ago:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together they painted a total of 22 eggs because Sarah and Camden together painted 30 eggs and there are 56 eggs in total.

So, if Arnold and Madeline together painted 22 eggs, and they painted the same number, then each of them painted:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs. Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs. Together they painted:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted:
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. We know Arnold painted 11 eggs, and Camden painted 21 eggs. So, the difference is:
\[ 21 - 11 = 10 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 10 more eggs than Arnold. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, but since the actual multiple-choice options are not provided, the numerical answer is 10.)"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them into groups of 8 crayons each. So, we need to find out how many groups he can make:

\[ 200 \div 8 = 25 \]

This means he can make 25 groups. Each group will go into one box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. So, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ 400 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds. The correct answer is:

**C**"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. John has a 80-foot tree. He can make logs from 80% of it. So, he can make logs from:
   \[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

2. He cuts these 64 feet into 4-foot logs. To find out how many 4-foot logs he gets:
   \[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

3. From each of these 16 logs, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he gets is:
   \[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

4. He sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total money he makes is:
   \[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes $96. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Valerie earns $5000 a month. Her brother earns twice that amount because Valerie earns half of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add Valerie's and her brother's salaries together:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:

\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, to find out the total amount of money they all have together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Grandma walks 3 miles a day. She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. We need to find out how long it takes her to walk the entire 3 miles.

First, we know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. So, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the speed she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Since her speed on the sidewalk is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles per minute, it will take her:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time for her to walk the entire 3 miles is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

The correct answer is:

"Jane has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks. So, she has saved $32 so far. She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract $32 from $60:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Jane needs to save $28 more. Since she saves $4 each week, we divide $28 by $4 to find out how many more weeks it will take her:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The correct answer is:

**B. 7**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We have:
- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each.
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each.
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees with 7 birds each:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 birds each:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Then, we add the blue birds in the last tree with 3 birds:
\[ 3 \]

Now, we add all these together to find the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds is 32. The correct answer is:

"Bob starts with some marbles and if he gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. So, we need to find out how many marbles he has at first. If he gets 24 more, he has 60, so we subtract 24 from 60 to find out how many he had before:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob had 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, Bob will have 26 marbles left. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is an unknown temperature. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug. He can now drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees.

Let's think about it step by step:

1. The 33-degree mug has 4 ounces poured out, so it has 29 degrees left.
2. He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug, which we'll call \( T \) degrees.
3. The total water in his bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug).
4. The average temperature of the water in his bottle is \(\frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5}\) because he's mixing 29 degrees from the 33-degree mug and \( T - 1 \) degrees from the other mug.
5. For Donny to be able to drink the water, this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. So, we need to solve the inequality:
   \[
   \frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5} \geq 40
   \]
6. Simplify the inequality:
   \[
   29 + T - 1 \geq 200
   \]
   \[
   28 + T \geq 200
   \]
   \[
   T \geq 172

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Every day, 20 more cows and 10 more chickens come to the farm. We need to find out how many animals there will be after 21 days (which is three weeks).

First, let's see how many cows come in 21 days:
- 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

Now, let's see how many chickens come in 21 days:
- 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

The farm already has:
- 50 cows + 20 chickens = 70 animals

After 21 days, the farm will have:
- 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows
- 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

So, the total number of animals will be:
- 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700. So, the correct answer is C."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Russell orders 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00.
2. So, the total cost for 4 packs is:
   \[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]
3. If he gets a 10% discount, the discount amount is:
   \[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
4. So, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]
5. Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have:
   \[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]
6. To find out how much each single bagel costs, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
   \[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, each single bagel costs 1 dollar. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. The problem says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So, we do:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 2 scoops

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a simple ratio:

2 scoops : 3 potatoes
18 scoops : ? potatoes

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can use a simple calculation:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how many eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- So, \(3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}\).

Next, we calculate how many eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- So, \(5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}\).

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs:
- Total eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- \(240 \, \text{eggs} \div 12 = 20 \, \text{dozen}\).

So, Chester will need 20 dozen eggs for 60 days. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{B}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jess wants to know how many blue jellybeans are in a jar. She can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. So, if there are 17 green jellybeans, then there are 17 times 2 = 34 red jellybeans. Now, if we add the green and red jellybeans together, we get 17 green + 34 red = 51 jellybeans. Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, we subtract the 51 jellybeans that are green and red from the total. So, 60 total - 51 green and red = 9 blue jellybeans.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9. The correct answer is:

"Tim grows 5 trees, and each year he gets 6 lemons from each tree. To find out how many lemons he gets in a decade, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, let's find out how many lemons he gets from all his trees in one year:
- He has 5 trees.
- Each tree gives him 6 lemons.
- So, in one year, he gets \(5 \times 6 = 30\) lemons.

Now, a decade is 10 years. So, to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in one year by 10:
- He gets 30 lemons in one year.
- In 10 years, he gets \(30 \times 10 = 300\) lemons.

So, the number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is 300. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

If the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many passengers each part represents. We do this by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 84 \div 14 = 6 \]
So, each part of the ratio represents 6 passengers.

Now, to find out how many women are on the bus, we multiply the number of parts for women (9) by the number of passengers each part represents (6):
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]
So, there are 54 women on the bus initially.

Next, we are told that 20 women alight from the bus. To find out how many women remain, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the initial number of women:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Faraday sells sunflowers and bouquets. Each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8. From the sunflowers, Faraday earns $26 per day. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and earns Faraday $8 per day. From the bouquets, Faraday earns $56 per day. So, the number of bouquets sold per day is:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

\[ \text{Sunflowers in bouquets} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \]

Now, the total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold from sunflowers and the sunflowers sold from bouquets:

\[ \text{Total sunflowers per day} = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Faraday sells sunflowers for 3 days, so the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:

\[ \text{Total sunflowers after 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291. The correct answer is:

3. He sells 60% of his rocks. So, he sells:
   \[
   20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]
4. Each rock is sold for $7, so he gets:
   \[
   12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the days for each type of picture scene and then add them up.

First, let's see how many days it takes to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
- To find out how many days it takes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:
  \[
  \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, let's see how many days it takes to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
- To find out how many days it takes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
  \]

Then, let's see how many days it takes to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
- To find out how many days it takes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:
  \[
  \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
  \]

Now, we add up all the days:
- Days for large-sized scenes: 9 days
- Days for medium-sized scenes: 6 days
- Days for small-sized scenes: 7 days
- Total days: \(9 + 6 + 7 = 22\) days

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to draw all the picture scenes. The correct answer is:

"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. So, the total distance is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles. The total time is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, so:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour. The correct answer is:

\[ \text{C} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Mark has two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. So, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning.

To find out the chance that both tickets are winners, we multiply the chances together. 

First ticket: 20% = 0.20
Second ticket: 60% = 0.60

Now, we multiply these two chances:
0.20 × 0.60 = 0.12

To change this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 × 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The correct answer is:
A. 12%"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Carlos, Jim, and Carrey collected seashells at the beach. Jim collected 27 seashells. We know Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, if we take away 5 from 27, we find out how many seashells Carlos collected. 

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, we know Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If Carlos collected 22 seashells, then Carrey collected half of that.

\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \]

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we add up all the seashells they collected:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided these seashells equally among themselves. To find out how many seashells each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3.

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

So, each person got 20 seashells.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to add up the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on weekends.

First, let's count the carrots he eats on weekdays:
- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday).
- So, the total carrots he eats on weekdays = 4 carrots/day × 5 days = 20 carrots.

Next, let's count the carrots he eats on weekends:
- Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday.
- There are 2 days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
- So, the total carrots he eats on the weekend = 5 carrots/day × 2 days = 10 carrots.

Now, we add the carrots from weekdays and weekends together:
- Total carrots = Carrots on weekdays + Carrots on weekends = 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week. The correct answer is C."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to add the time of the first song to the time of the second song.

The first song is 5 minutes long.
The second song is 60% longer than the first song, so we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

First, we find 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add this to the original 5 minutes:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 8 minutes long.

Next, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Linus bought mobile devices and sold them. Here's what we know:
- He bought each mobile device for $20.
- He sold each mobile device for twice the price he bought it for, so he sold each for $40.
- Last Monday, he bought 2 mobile devices.
- Last Tuesday, he bought 4 mobile devices.

First, let's find out how much he spent on all the mobile devices:
- For the 2 mobile devices he bought on Monday, he spent 2 times $20, which is $40.
- For the 4 mobile devices he bought on Tuesday, he spent 4 times $20, which is $80.
- So, the total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

Next, let's find out how much he made from selling all the mobile devices:
- He sold each of the 6 mobile devices for $40.
- So, the total money he made is 6 times $40, which is $240.

Now, to find out how much profit he made, we subtract the total cost from the total money he made:
- Profit = Total money made - Total cost
- Profit = $240 - $120 = $120.

So, the profit Linus made is $120. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so we calculate Ned's height:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so we calculate Carl's height:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Carl's cane is half as long as Carl is tall. So, we find the length of the cane:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet. The correct answer is:

C. 3"
"To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many bottles are needed to cover the energy needs of 2300 people. Since each person needs 5 bottles (because 20% of a bottle covers 20% of their daily energy need, so 5 bottles cover 100% of their daily energy need), we multiply 2300 by 5:
   \[
   2300 \times 5 = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number of bottles Hortex can produce from the number of bottles needed:
   \[
   11500 - 4200 = 7300 \text{ bottles}
   \]

So, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles of juice to satisfy the energy needs of 2300 people.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{7300}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carla has 8 babies. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.

First, we find out how many babies are dressed in purple:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \]
So, 6 babies are dressed in purple.

Next, we find out how many babies are dressed in blue:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]
So, 2 babies are dressed in blue.

Now, we know that all the babies dressed in blue also wear bows. So, 2 babies wear bows.

Also, 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple wear bows:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
So, 2 babies dressed in purple also wear bows.

Now, we have a total of 3 babies wearing bows (2 in blue and 1 in purple).

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the number of purple-wearers wearing bows and the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100 = 66.67\% \]

So, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 66.67%.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{66.67\%} \]

The multiple-choice options are:
A. 25%
B. 50%
C. 66.67%
D. 100%

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C. 66.67\%} \]"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday from the total reports received last week.

First, let's add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday:
\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Now, we subtract this total from the overall reports received last week:
\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it first. Half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 square meters for $50. That means he got $50 for 40 square meters, so the price per square meter was $50 divided by 40, which is $1.25 per square meter.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land. 1/4 of 80 is 20, so he sold 20 square meters for $30. That means he got $30 for 20 square meters, so the price per square meter was $30 divided by 20, which is $1.50 per square meter.

Now, he has 20 square meters left, and he sold these for $3 per square meter. So, 20 square meters at $3 per square meter is 20 times 3, which is $60.

To find out how much money he earned in total, we add up all the money he got from selling the land:
- $50 from the first sale
- $30 from the second sale
- $60 from the remaining land

So, $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The total money Abraham earned is $140. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Haley is 26 years old. Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age. So, we first find half of Haley's age:

Half of 26 is 13.

Now, we take 10 less than 13:

13 - 10 = 3

So, Geb is 3 years old.

The correct answer is:
3"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days.

First, let's see how many face masks he uses in one day:
- He goes out 3 times a day.
- Each time he goes out, he changes his mask 2 times.
- So, in one day, he uses \(3 \times 2 = 6\) face masks.

Now, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days:
- If he uses 6 face masks in one day, then in 2 days, he will use \(6 \times 2 = 12\) face masks.

So, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is 12. The correct answer is:

\boxed{12}"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Lamar found 5 eggs.
Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs they found from the total number of eggs Cole hid:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we have two apartment complexes with 200 apartments each. So, together they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex has 60% more apartments than the first two combined. To find out how many more apartments that is, we calculate 60% of 400:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]

So, the third complex has:
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, John collects garbage 3 times a week from each of the three complexes. So, the total number of collections in a week is:
\[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 for each collection. So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct option for 1248 in a multiple-choice format)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times 50 fruits, which is 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times 50 fruits, which is 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times 50 fruits, which is 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times 50 fruits, which is 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced each year:
50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + 800 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old) = 2350 fruits.

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. So if the blue rope is 5 centimeters, the red rope would be 4 times 5, which is 20 centimeters.

We also know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. So if the blue rope is 5 centimeters, the yellow rope would be 5 plus 7, which is 12 centimeters.

Now, we add up the lengths of all three ropes:
Red rope: 20 centimeters
Blue rope: 5 centimeters
Yellow rope: 12 centimeters

20 + 5 + 12 = 37 centimeters

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The correct answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step.

We know the total paint used is 12 pints. The mural has four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. The problem tells us that red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts, and half the mural is yellow.

First, let's figure out how much yellow paint there is. Since half the mural is yellow, and the total is 12 pints, we can calculate:
\[ \text{Yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Now, we know that red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts. Let's say each of these colors is \( R \) pints. So, we have:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( R \), we solve:
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to add up the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
- One bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet.
- So, the area of one bedroom is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
- \(4 \times 240 = 960\) square feet.

Next, we calculate the area of the living room:
- The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
- So, the area of the living room is \(5 \times 240 = 1200\) square feet.

Now, we know the rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
- Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
- Total area = \(960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160\) square feet.

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet. The correct answer is C."
"Let's break it down day by day to find out how many puffs of clouds Alice sees each day and then add them all up.

- On Monday, Alice sees 3 puffs of clouds.
- On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so that's \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so that's \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, let's add up all the puffs of clouds she sees from Monday to Friday:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48\]

Adding these step by step:
\[3 + 6 = 9\]
\[9 + 12 = 21\]
\[21 + 24 = 45\]
\[45 + 48 = 93\]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know the original box has 100 pods and costs $12.
2. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. So, we need to find out how many pods are in the new box.
3. 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
4. So, the new box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.
5. The new box costs $12, and it has 120 pods.
6. If we use 1 pod per cycle, we need to find out how many cycles we can do with $1.
7. Since each pod costs $0.10 (because $12 for 120 pods means $0.10 per pod), with $1, we can buy \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.
8. So, with $1, we can run 10 cycles.

The number of dishwashing cycles with the new box that can be run for $1 is 10.

The correct answer is **B**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. He loses 10 bills on the way home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   So, he has:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills left}
   \]

4. He then triples his money. Since each bill is $20, his total money is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Finally, he converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills. The correct answer is:
\boxed{240}"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

In the first half:
- Team A scored 4 goals.
- Team B scored 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scored 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scored 4 times 2, which is 8 goals.
- Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals Team B scored in the second half, so Team A scored 1/4 of 8, which is 2 goals.

Now, let's add up all the goals:
- Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so in total, Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals.
- Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so in total, Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.

The correct answer is 16."
"Let's break down the problem again, but this time in a simpler way.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk. So, we need to find out how much chalk he used and how much is left.

1. Calculate how much chalk he used on Monday:
   \[
   45\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, he used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday.

2. Now, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday:
   \[
   5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, he has 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

3. The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

4. Let's calculate the chalk left each day:
   - **Tuesday**: 
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 2.75 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he uses 0.55 inches on Tuesday, and the chalk left is:
     \[
     2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Wednesday**:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 2.20 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 2.20 = 0.44 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he uses 0.44 inches on Wednesday, and the chalk left is:
     \[
     2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Thursday**:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 1.76 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 1.76 = 0.352 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he uses 0.352 inches on Thursday, and the chalk left is:
     \[
     1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Friday**:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 1.408 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 1.408 = 0.2816 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he uses 0.2816 inches on Friday, and the chalk left is:
     \[
     1.408 - 0.2816 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Saturday**:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 1.1264 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 1.1264 = 0.22528 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he uses 0.22528 inches on Saturday, and the chalk left is:
     \[
     1.1264 - 0.22528 = 0.90112 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Sunday**:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 0.90112 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 0.90112 = 0.180224 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he uses 0.180224 inches on Sunday, and the chalk left is:
     \[
     0.90112 - 0.180224 = 0.720896 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. We see that on Sunday, the chalk left is 0.720896 inches, which is still more than 2 inches. So, we need to continue this process until the chalk is less than 2 inches.

6. Let's check the next day:
   - **Monday of the next week**:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 0.720896 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 0.720896 = 0.1441792 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he uses 0.1441792 inches on Monday, and the chalk left is:
     \[
     0.720896 - 0.1441792 = 0.5767168 \text{ inches}
     \]

7. We see that on Monday of the next week, the chalk left is 0.5767168 inches, which is still more than 2 inches. So, we need to continue this process.

8. Let's check the next day:
   - **Tuesday of the next week**:
     \[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. We need to find out how many students are not on varsity.

First, we find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

Next, we find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Now, we calculate how many girls and boys are not on varsity.

For the girls:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

For the boys:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

To find the total number of students not on varsity, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply:

Mike bought 5 face masks. Johnny bought 2 more than three times what Mike bought. So, we first find out how many face masks three times what Mike bought is. Three times 5 is 15. Then we add 2 to 15, which gives us 17. So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"Okay, let's break it down simply.

James has 30 teeth. His dentist does two things:
1. Drills 4 teeth.
2. Caps 7 more teeth than he drills.

So, the dentist caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

Now, the dentist fixes \(4 + 11 = 15\) teeth in total.

To find out what percentage of his teeth the dentist fixes, we use this formula:
\[
\text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]
Plugging in the numbers:
\[
\text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
(Note: In a multiple-choice format, B would be the correct letter option for 50%)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk. Each gallon cost $3.5. So, the total cost was:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

He returned 2/5 of the milk because it was not good. So, the amount of milk he returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The cost of 1600 gallons of milk is:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 back. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. So, if Colin is \( C \) years old now, in seven years he will be \( C + 7 \) years old. Wendy's age now is \( W \), and we know:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, in 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old, and Wendy will be \( W + 25 \) years old. We can write:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation. We know \( W = 5(C + 7) \), so we substitute \( 5(C + 7) \) for \( W \) in the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

To get rid of the fraction, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we move the terms with \( C \) to one side and the numbers to the other side:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is 20 years old now. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Bob has $27,000 to spend on books. He can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we divide $27,000 by $500:

\[ 27000 \div 500 = 54 \]

So, he can buy 54 sets of 100 books. That means he can buy:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, he wants to divide these 5400 books equally among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[ 5400 \div 3 = 1800 \]

So, each school gets 1800 books. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's count the apples step by step:

1. First, two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. Newton picked up these two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 (remaining apple)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 (pocketed apple) + 1 (thrown apple) = 2

3. Newton picked up the remaining apple, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 0 (all apples thrown)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 2 (pocketed apples) + 1 (thrown apple) = 3

4. Another 6 apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 3 (pocketed apples) + 6 (picked up apples) = 9

So, Newton brought home 9 apples. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much Ali's order of coal costs, we need to figure out how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal and then multiply that by the cost of each bag.

First, we divide the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Now, we know there are 17 bags, and each bag costs $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is $306. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cheese pizza slices are eaten by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices, so we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to find out how many cheese pizzas are needed for 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizza slices are eaten by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices, so we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed for 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. In total, she needs to buy:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is 6. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, the total miles are:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, the total miles are:

"To find out how long it will take Jay to make 60 snowballs, we need to figure out how many snowballs he can make in a given time, considering that some melt.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Let's see how many snowballs he makes in 15 minutes:
- In 15 minutes, he makes 20 snowballs.
- But 2 snowballs melt, so he actually makes:
  \[
  20 - 2 = 18 \text{ snowballs in 15 minutes}
  \]

Now, let's see how many snowballs he makes in an hour:
- In an hour (which is 4 times 15 minutes), he makes:
  \[
  18 \times 4 = 72 \text{ snowballs}
  \]

Since he makes 72 snowballs in an hour, but we only need 60 snowballs, we can see that in just under an hour, he will have 60 snowballs. So, it will take him:
\[
\boxed{1 \text{ hour}}
\]
This is the correct answer because after 1 hour, he will have made 72 snowballs, which is more than 60, and he will have already made 60 before the hour is complete."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

When the show came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John is 28 years old now, we need to find out how old Jim was then.

If John was 28 when the show came out, that means Jim was half of that age. So, Jim was 14 years old when the show came out.

Since no time has passed and the show is now 20 years old, Jim is still 14 years old now.

So, the answer is 14."

Doxa cut an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 piece. Her sister ate 1 more piece than Doxa, so her sister ate 2 pieces. Her brother ate 1 more piece than her sister, so her brother ate 3 pieces.

Now, let's add up how many pieces they ate together:
- Doxa ate 1 piece
- Her sister ate 2 pieces
- Her brother ate 3 pieces

So, the total number of pieces they ate is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 pieces.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 12 bandages left after using 38.
2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 28 bandages. After using 28 bandages, they had 34 bandages left.
3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. After using 25 bandages, they had 61 bandages left (34 + 100 - 25).
4. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used 61 - 78 = 17 bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Now, let's see how many bandages they started with on the first day. They had 12 bandages left after the first day, so they must have started with 12 + 38 = 50 bandages on the first day.

The number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the hair color is $40.
2. May's hair was originally 10 inches long and ended up at 8 inches long. So, she had 2 inches of hair cut off.
3. The cost of cutting the hair is $30 for each inch. So, for 2 inches, the cost is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.
4. Now, we add the cost of the hair color and the cost of cutting the hair: \(40 + 60 = 100\) dollars.

So, the total cost for May's haircut and color is $100.

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.

So, her weekly earnings are:
\[ 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 67.50 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total earnings for the month are:
\[ 67.50 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

Jen also gets an extra $10 for each week she has complete attendance. Since she didn't have any absences in April, she gets this bonus for 4 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add her total earnings for the month and her total attendance bonus:
\[ 270 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 310 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jen will receive:
\[
\boxed{310}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jason gets money for doing different chores. Here's how much he gets for each:

- Doing laundry: $3.00
- Cleaning his room: $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 each time
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 each time

Now, let's see how much he got for each chore he did:

- He did laundry once, so that's $3.00.
- He cleaned his room once, so that's $1.50.
- He took the trash out twice, so that's $0.75 times 2, which is $1.50.
- He emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so that's $0.50 times 6, which is $3.00.

Now, let's add all these amounts together:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in two weeks. The correct answer is:

Mr. Maxim works at a restaurant. On a particular day, 50 people came in the morning. At 10:00, 40 more people came in and ate. After that, twice as many people as those who came in the morning came in. By evening, 3 times as many people as those who came in the morning also came in.

To find out how many people came in total, we need to add all these numbers together.

1. Morning: 50 people
2. At 10:00: 40 people
3. Twice the morning: \(2 \times 50 = 100\) people
4. Evening: \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people

Now, let's add them all up:
\[ 50 + 40 + 100 + 150 = 340 \]

So, the total number of people who came in the restaurant on that day is 340. 

The correct answer is C."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and 10 packs of black pens because she bought twice as many black pens as red pens. Each pack has 5 pens.

So, the number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

And the number of black pens is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens, we add the red pens and black pens together:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, Alain has 75 pens in total. The correct answer is:
**75**"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. So, each bottle of scotch costs $60.

Now, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. So, he buys 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. So, each bottle of cognac costs $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, to find out how much he spends on the cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle: 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

To find out the total amount he spends, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

So, John spends $2400 in total.

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Julius planted trees over two days. Here's how many he planted each day:

- On the first day, he planted 20 White Oak trees and 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, so that's 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted:

- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 trees
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 trees

So, the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted is 50 White Oak trees + 90 Lodgepole Pine trees = 140 trees.

The total number of trees Mr. Julius planted in the two days is 140."
"Let's calculate how much root beer is left for the party step by step.

1. Fred starts with 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drink 4 gallons, so:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. Barbie spills 7 gallons, so:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. Ronnie drinks 5 gallons, so:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have the equation: \(4x + 8 = 40\).

First, we need to get rid of the 8. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8\]
\[4x = 32\]

Next, we need to find out what \(x\) is. We do this by dividing both sides by 4:
\[4x ÷ 4 = 32 ÷ 4\]
\[x = 8\]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The correct answer is:
**B**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 66 fish in the tank.
2. One-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we calculate one-third of 66:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   So, 22 fish have red stripes.
3. Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after we count the red-striped fish:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]
   So, 44 fish are left.
4. Out of these 44 fish, 5/11 have blue stripes. We calculate 5/11 of 44:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 fish have blue stripes.
5. To find out how many fish have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of red-striped fish and blue-striped fish:
   \[
   22 + 20 = 42
   \]

So, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is 42. The correct answer is:

\boxed{42}"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Amy starts with two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors. So, she has \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors from the palettes.
2. She also has three makeup sets, each with 6 colors. So, she has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors from the makeup sets.
3. In total, Amy has \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Now, her sister takes one of the palettes, which has 4 colors. So, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\] colors left.

Next, Amy uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is:
\[6 \div 2 = 3\] colors.

So, after using up half of the colors from one makeup set, Amy has:
\[22 - 3 = 19\] colors left.

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 19. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times as tall as he is. So, we calculate the height of the house:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The house has two floors, so we divide the total height by 2 to find the height of each floor:

\[ \frac{420}{2} = 210 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison is:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the second floor is:

\[ 210 - 180 = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 30 inches. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.
   - 40% of 700 is calculated as \( 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \) shells.
   - So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

2. Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found theirs. We subtract the 280 shells from the total 700 shells.
   - 700 - 280 = 420 shells are left.

3. Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
   - 60% of 420 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \) shells.
   - So, team The finders found 252 shells.

4. Now, we need to find out how many shells team Gogetters found. We subtract the 252 shells found by The finders from the 420 shells that were left.
   - 420 - 252 = 168 shells.
   - So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

Therefore, the number of shells team Gogetters found is 168. The correct answer is C."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to figure out the total miles all the dogs need to walk and then subtract the miles the other dogs need to walk.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.
Let's add these up: \(1 + 4 + 3 = 8\) miles.

The average distance all four dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. If we multiply the average by the number of dogs, we get the total miles all dogs need to walk: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) miles.

Now, we subtract the miles the first, second, and third dogs need to walk from the total miles: \(12 - 8 = 4\) miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

The correct answer is:
4"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan that is 40% of that. So, we need to find 40% of $250,000.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 250,000 = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

So, John gets a loan of $100,000. He uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. So, we need to find 60% of $100,000.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 100,000 = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Now, to find out how much money John has leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount.

\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, John has $40,000 leftover. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we need to add up the weights of the tunas he caught and then multiply that total by the price per kilogram.

First, let's add up the weights:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Adding these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, we know that each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. So, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars per kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Deandre will earn 64 dollars. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Trinity bought the magazines for $72. She sells them at 11/8 of that price. First, we need to find out how much she sells each magazine for.

To find out the selling price, we do:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Now, let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, Trinity sells each magazine for $99.

Now, to find out her profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Brian bought a dehumidifier to make his basement drier. The dehumidifier has three speeds: low, medium, and high. Here's how much water it removes each day:

- On the low setting, it removes 1 liter of water each day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, so that's 2 liters of water each day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, so that's 4 liters of water each day.

Brian used the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, 3 days on the medium setting, and 5 days on the high setting. We need to find out how much water it removed in total.

First, let's see how much water it removed on each setting:
- On the low setting for 3 days: 1 liter/day × 3 days = 3 liters.
- On the medium setting for 3 days: 2 liters/day × 3 days = 6 liters.
- On the high setting for 5 days: 4 liters/day × 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, let's add up all the water removed:
3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.

So, the dehumidifier removed a total of 29 liters of water from the air in Brian's basement.

The correct answer is B."
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we start by calculating the total number of balloons they had at the beginning. They filled 10 packs, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, we multiply 10 by 30:

\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \]

This means they had 300 balloons in total. By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 - 12 = 288 \]

So, they threw 288 balloons. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we first need to know how much medicine is in one dose. 

For one dose, Saanvi uses 14 mL of the first medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the second medicine is:

\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL} \]

Now, we add the amounts of both medicines to get the total amount in one dose:

\[ 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL} \]

So, one dose has 56 mL of medicine. To find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ali's class can have 120 students. John has two classes, and each of John's classes can have \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class. So, we need to find out how many students are in each of John's classes.

First, we calculate the number of students in one of John's classes:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, we multiply the number of students in one class by 2:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the number of students in Ali's class to the number of students in John's classes to get the total number of students in both schools:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister. He promised to give her back $300 plus 2% more. First, we need to find out how much 2% is on $300.

2% of $300 is:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, Stephen has to give back:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Now, Stephen will pay $25 each month for 11 months. So, the total he will pay in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much he will pay in the last month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he has to pay:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the last month. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many jelly beans can fit in the jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches on the bottom and 15 inches tall. Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches of space.

1. Calculate the volume of the jar:
   - The jar is a square box, so its volume is \(6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540\) cubic inches.

2. Calculate the effective volume for the jelly beans:
   - Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we use \(540 \times 0.80 = 432\) cubic inches.

3. Calculate how many jelly beans can fit in the jar:
   - Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so the number of jelly beans is \(432 \div 0.15 = 2880\).

4. Calculate how many of these jelly beans are red:
   - Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, so \(2880 \times 0.30 = 864\) jelly beans are red.

5. The true number of red jelly beans is 900. So, how many are off:
   - The difference is \(900 - 864 = 36\).

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The bus starts with 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 more people get on the bus. So, the bus now has \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop get on again. So, \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) more people get on the bus. Now, the bus has \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. So, \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people are on the bus now.
5. The bus can hold a total of 200 people. So, the number of people needed to fill the remaining spaces is \(200 - 180 = 20\).

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
2. The cost of one visit is $2.
3. In the first 5 years, the cost doesn't change, so she visits 3 times a year for 5 years.
   - Number of visits in the first 5 years = 3 visits/year × 5 years = 15 visits.
   - Total cost for the first 5 years = 15 visits × $2/visit = $30.
4. After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%, so the new cost is:
   - New cost = $2 + ($2 × 1.5) = $2 + $3 = $5.
5. For the next 3 years, she visits 3 times a year.
   - Number of visits in the next 3 years = 3 visits/year × 3 years = 9 visits.
   - Total cost for the next 3 years = 9 visits × $5/visit = $45.
6. Total cost for all visits = $30 (first 5 years) + $45 (next 3 years) = $75.

So, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum.

Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4, 5, and 6. There are 10 students in each grade, so we have:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find out how many groups we need, we divide the total number of students by the number of students that can try at once:
\[ 30 \div 8 = 3.75 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the next whole number. So, we need 4 groups.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. To find out the total time, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes:
\[ 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have a board that is 40 feet long. Ian wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.

Let's say the shorter piece is \( x \) feet long. Then the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet long.

The total length of the board is the sum of the shorter piece and the longer piece, which is 40 feet. So we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece, so:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The longer piece is 32 feet long. The correct answer is:

"To find out how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he needs, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many pounds of meat Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. We know that 16 meatballs are made from 1 pound of meat. So, we divide the number of meatballs he wants by the number of meatballs he gets from 1 pound of meat:
   \[
   \text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. So, we multiply the number of pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find out how much seasoning he needs:
   \[
   \text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}

"To find out how much a 36-minute call costs, we need to break it into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the rest of the call.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes. Each minute costs $0.25, so:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the remaining 20 minutes. After the first 16 minutes, the cost drops to $0.2 per minute, so:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the costs of both parts together:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. There are 5 people in her class, and each person gets 2 treats. We need to find out how many cupcakes Carly made.

First, we know that the total number of treats is 5 people times 2 treats each, which is 10 treats in total.

Let's say Carly made \( C \) cupcakes. Then she made \( 3C - 2 \) brownies because she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.

The total number of treats is the cupcakes plus the brownies, so:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's check if this is right:
- If Carly made 3 cupcakes, then she made \( 3 \times 3 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \) brownies.
- The total number of treats is \( 3 + 7 = 10 \), which matches the number of treats needed.

Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is 3. The correct answer is:

The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

So, the discount amount is $15. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

This means the cost for both services with the discount is $60.

Next, Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total, and each nail art service costs $3. So, the total cost for the nail art is:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Now, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost of the manicure and pedicure:

\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, the total amount Karen would pay is $90.

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{D} \] (Assuming D is the correct option in a multiple-choice format, if provided.)"
"Susan gets magazines from three different sources. Each of the three magazines sends her 12 issues a year, and she also gets a magazine that sends her 6 issues a year. The last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which means it sends her \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues a year.

So, the total number of magazines she gets every year is:
\[3 \text{ magazines} + 1 \text{ magazine} + 1 \text{ magazine} = 5 \text{ magazines}\]

The correct answer is:
\[5\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Samantha has 27 paintings. According to the problem, Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to the number of paintings Samantha has, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has.

So, we do:
\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]
Shelley has 39 paintings.

Next, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has, we can find out how many paintings Kim has.

So, we do:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]
Kim has 31 paintings.

Therefore, the number of paintings Kim has is 31. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

In November, the toy costs $40. In December, the price goes up by 80%. To find out how much that is, we calculate 80% of $40:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \]
So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]
In January, the price goes down by 50%. To find out how much that is, we calculate 50% of $72:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 72 = 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \]
So, the price in January is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]
Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Charlie teaches tennis lessons. He charges $80 for each lesson. Today, he has 4 lessons at the regular price and 2 lessons for veterans. For veterans, he charges 25% less than the regular price.

First, let's find out how much he charges for the veteran lessons. If the regular price is $80, then 25% less is:
\[ 80 - (80 \times 0.25) = 80 - 20 = 60 \]
So, he charges $60 for each veteran lesson.

Now, let's calculate how much he makes from the regular lessons:
\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 = \$320 \]

Next, let's calculate how much he makes from the veteran lessons:
\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 = \$120 \]

To find the total money he makes, we add the money from the regular lessons and the veteran lessons:
\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie makes for the day is $440. The correct answer is C."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of scores she got.

First, let's add up all her scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Adding them up:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

So, the total sum of her scores is 630.

Now, we count how many scores she got. She got 9 scores in total.

To find the mean, we divide the total sum by the number of scores:
Mean = 630 ÷ 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70.

The correct answer is:
\boxed{B} (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, which is not provided in the original question but is included here for the sake of following the instruction.)"
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she has 1/4 of the pomelos she started with. So, she has 1/4 * 20 = 5 pomelos left.

To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number she has left from the original number:
20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The correct answer is:
15"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many he ate, we do:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, he ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left after he ate:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find out how many that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, he gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left after he gave some to his sister:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Walter received 81 dollars. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{81}
\]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Regina wrote 9 novels last year. The problem says that 9 is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. We need to find out how many novels she wrote this year.

If 9 is 3 quarters, we can think of it like this: if we have 4 quarters of something, it makes a whole. So, if 3 quarters are 9, then 1 quarter would be 9 divided by 3. That means 1 quarter is 3 novels.

Now, since 1 quarter is 3 novels, 4 quarters (which is the whole) would be 4 times 3. So, 4 times 3 is 12.

Therefore, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The correct answer is:
12"
"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate how much distance he travels in 3 days and then find out what part that distance is of the total distance.

Michael travels at a speed of 50 km/hr. In 3 days, there are 3 times 24 hours, which is 72 hours. So, the distance he travels in 72 hours is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage 3600 km is of 6000 km, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{A. } 60\% \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie needs 12 grapes. So, for 4 pies, she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. To find out how many grapes were there at the beginning, we add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used for the pies: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning. The correct answer is:

\boxed{84}"
"To find out how many teachers were at school, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

So, we do the math:
82 (total teachers) - 13 (sick teachers) = 69
69 (after subtracting sick teachers) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 78

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is 78.

The correct answer is C. 78."
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to add up the cost of the ingredients he uses each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's add up the cost of the ingredients he uses each week:
- The pasta costs $1.00.
- The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it costs $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, we add these costs together:
- $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

So, Bud spends $10.00 each week on making macaroni and cheese.

Next, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the weekly cost by 52:
- $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year. The correct answer is C."
"To find out what percentage of their day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to do the following steps:

1. Calculate the total time needed to clean all classrooms:
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom.
   - So, the total time is \(80 \times 15 = 1200\) minutes.

2. Convert the total cleaning time into hours:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, \(1200 \div 60 = 20\) hours.

3. Calculate the percentage of the workday spent cleaning:
   - The custodian works 8 hours a day.
   - The time spent cleaning is 20 hours.
   - But remember, this is more than one full workday, so we need to find out what percentage of 8 hours is 20 hours.
   - The percentage is \(\frac{20}{8} \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\%\).

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. This means they work more than one full day just to clean the classrooms.

The correct answer is:

"Let's figure out how many bookcases Elly needs for her books.

First, we know the middle shelves can each hold 10 books. Since there are 2 middle shelves, they can hold:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ books} \]

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books} \]

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books} \]

Now, let's add up the total number of books all the shelves can hold:
\[ 20 \text{ (middle shelves)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the total capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Rose bought five dozens of eggs. A dozen is 12 eggs, so five dozens is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The eggs cost $2.40 for each dozen. Since she bought five dozens, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total selling price is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much profit Rose makes, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{D} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Skyler has 100 hats. Half of them are red, so that means he has 50 red hats.

After taking out the red hats, he has 50 hats left. Out of these 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. To find out how many blue hats he has, we do:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

So, Skyler has 30 blue hats.

Now, to find out how many white hats he has, we take the remaining hats after taking out the red and blue hats. He had 50 hats left after taking out the red ones, and now we know 30 of those are blue. So, the number of white hats is:

\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that a bag of beef jerky costs $18.00 and it has 30 sticks in it. So, if we divide the price by the number of sticks, we can find out how much each stick costs.

\[ \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{18.00}{30} = 0.60 \]

So, each stick costs $0.60. Now, we need to convert this to cents. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, we multiply $0.60 by 100.

\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs 60 cents. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. So, we calculate:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
This means Audrey got 42 questions right on the first test.

Now, we know that to pass, she needs to get 70% of the total questions right. The total number of questions on both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
This means she needs to get 77 questions right in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]
So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to pass.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"

But one of the marbles he found was not a marble, it was a bead, so he got rid of that. So he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7."
"To find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer to come to the dealership. To sell 15 cars, he needs 8 customers because 15 cars divided by 2 cars per customer equals 7.5, and we round up to 8 customers.

Now, we need to find out how many telephone calls he needs to make to get 8 customers. Since 25 telephone calls get him 1 customer, we can calculate the number of telephone calls needed for 8 customers by multiplying 25 by 8.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 25 \text{ calls/customer} \times 8 \text{ customers} = 200 \text{ calls} \]

Therefore, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Brianna and her family have 8 rooms in their house. They have 4 people, including Brianna, so they need 4 flashlights. They also have 2 flashlights for each room, so that's 8 rooms times 2 flashlights per room, which equals 16 flashlights. But they only need 4, so that's 4 flashlights.

Now, they have candles too. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, for the 4 rooms with 4 small candles each, they have 4 rooms times 4 candles, which is 16 candles. For the 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each, they have 4 rooms times 5 candles, which is 20 candles. So, in total, they have 16 small candles plus 20 medium candles, which is 36 candles.

Now, if we add the flashlights and the candles together, they have 4 flashlights plus 36 candles, which is 40 things in total.

So, the correct answer is:

"To find out how long it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time he spends on each side.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
- The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
- The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(0.5 \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes.
- The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(0.5 \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:

- 4 plants need half a cup of water each day.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each day.
- The rest need a quarter of a cup of water each day.

First, we find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know there are 20 plants in total, and 4 need half a cup and 8 need 1 cup. So, the rest are:
\[ 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \]
plants.

Now, let's calculate the total water needed for each group:
- For the 4 plants that need half a cup each, the total is:
\[ 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \text{ cups} \]
- For the 8 plants that need 1 cup each, the total is:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups} \]
- For the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup each, the total is:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ cups} \]

"To find out how long it takes Phineas to get home, we need to add the time he spends hopping and the time he spends swimming.

First, we calculate the time he spends hopping. He hops 100 yards and his speed is 20 yards per minute. So, the time spent hopping is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time he spends swimming. He swims 100 yards and his speed is 10 yards per minute. So, the time spent swimming is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the main phone costs $20. The problem says the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. So, if the main phone costs $20, each additional phone must cost half of that. 

Half of $20 is $10. So, each additional phone costs $10.

There are five phones in total, and one of them is the main phone. That means there are four additional phones.

If each additional phone costs $10 and there are four of them, then the total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

So, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \] (Assuming B is the correct answer in a multiple-choice format, if provided.)"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to know how many doughnuts he makes each day and then multiply that by the number of days in June and the price per doughnut.

First, let's find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes each day. He makes 10 dozen doughnuts each day. Since one dozen is 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts he makes each day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts he makes in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total money he makes is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts. The correct answer is C."
"Jade took 210 photos in total. She uploads 6 batches of 7 photos each day. To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day.

First, we calculate how many photos she uploads each day:
\[ 6 \text{ batches/day} \times 7 \text{ photos/batch} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Now, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded each day:
\[ 210 \text{ photos} \div 42 \text{ photos/day} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Here's how we do it:

- For blouses: 5 blouses at $5.00 each, so \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.
- For pants: 2 pairs at $8.00 each, so \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- For skirt: 1 skirt at $6.00, so \(1 \times 6 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add these amounts to find the total cost for one week:
\[25 + 16 + 6 = 47\] dollars.

So, Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in one week. To find out how much she spends in 5 weeks, we multiply $47.00 by 5:
\[47 \times 5 = 235\] dollars.

Therefore, Alicia spends \(\boxed{235}\) dollars on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

John's normal speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:
\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Each page has 450 words, and John needs to speak 10 pages. So, the total number of words is:
\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500}{375} \]

Let's do the division:
\[ \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it takes John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
2. On the second day, he saw 20 more people than the first day. So, he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. On the third day, he saw twice as many people as on the second day. So, he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.
4. For the rest of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days), he saw an average of 60 people each day. So, for these three days, he saw \(60 \times 3 = 180\) people.

Now, let's add up all the people he saw:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 180 = 440\]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 440.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the total number of kernels that popped is:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tim needs to make lemonade for a party. His recipe says he needs 1 cup of lemon juice for 1 gallon of lemonade. He wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade plus an extra gallon that is twice as tart.

First, let's find out how much lemon juice he needs for the regular lemonade:
- 4 gallons of lemonade need 4 cups of lemon juice.
- 1 gallon of lemonade needs 1 cup of lemon juice.

Now, for the extra tart lemonade, it's twice as tart as the regular lemonade. So, it also needs 1 cup of lemon juice.

So, in total, he needs:
- 4 cups for the regular lemonade.
- 1 cup for the extra tart lemonade.

That's 4 + 1 = 5 cups of lemon juice in total.

Now, we know that 6 lemons make 1 cup of lemon juice. So, for 5 cups, he needs:
- 5 cups × 6 lemons per cup = 30 lemons.

So, Tim will need 30 lemons. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food a day, and each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food a day.

First, let's find out how much dog food the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- 3 German Shepherds × 5 kg/German Shepherd = 15 kg

Next, let's find out how much dog food the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- 2 Bulldogs × 3 kg/Bulldog = 6 kg

Now, let's add the dog food eaten by the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs in a day:
- 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

This is the total amount of dog food they eat in one day. To find out how much they eat in a week, we multiply this by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
- 21 kg/day × 7 days/week = 147 kg

So, they will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week. The correct answer is:

\boxed{147}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have 10 animals that are 2-legged. So, the total number of legs from these animals is:
   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. We also have 15 animals that are 4-legged. So, the total number of legs from these animals is:
   \[
   15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. Now, we add the legs from both types of animals:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs}
   \]

4. Since we need to know the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs}
   \]

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the tower has:
- 4 blue blocks
- Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so 8 yellow blocks
- An unknown number of red blocks

The total number of blocks is 32.

First, let's add the blue and yellow blocks together:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} = 12 \text{ blocks} \]

Now, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks to find out how many red blocks there are:
\[ 32 \text{ (total blocks)} - 12 \text{ (blue and yellow blocks)} = 20 \text{ red blocks} \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

The correct answer is:

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in both directions and then see how far he is from his starting point.

Elvis drove west for 5 hours at a speed of 18 mph. So, the distance he traveled west is:
\[ 18 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Then, Elvis drove east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 mph. So, the distance he traveled east is:
\[ 18 \text{ mph} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 144 \text{ miles} \]

Since he drove west first and then east, the net distance from his house is the difference between the distance he traveled east and the distance he traveled west:
\[ 144 \text{ miles} - 90 \text{ miles} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The correct answer is:
C. 54 miles"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Gary bought a boat for $9000.
2. In the first year, the boat loses 30% of its value. So, we calculate 30% of $9000:
   \[
   9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   After the first year, the boat is worth:
   \[
   9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]
3. In the second year, the boat loses another 30% of its value. So, we calculate 30% of $6300:
   \[
   6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   After the second year, the boat is worth:
   \[
   6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]
4. In the third year, the boat loses 20% of its value. So, we calculate 20% of $4410:
   \[
   4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   After the third year, the boat is worth:
   \[
   4410 - 882 = 3528

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the bag has 232 pieces of Starbursts candy. We also know:
- 54 pieces are red.
- Twice as many are orange as red, so that's 2 times 54, which is 108 pieces.
- Half as many are yellow as red, so that's 54 divided by 2, which is 27 pieces.

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
- Red: 54
- Orange: 108
- Yellow: 27

Total of red, orange, and yellow candies:
54 + 108 + 27 = 189

The rest of the candies are pink. So, we subtract the total of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Helen stayed in a hotel for 3 nights. Each night costs $80. So, for 3 nights, the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]
This means the hotel cost is $240.

Next, Helen rode the bus 7 times. Each bus ride costs 10% of the hotel cost. So, the cost of one bus ride is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]
This means each bus ride costs $8. For 7 rides, the total cost is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]
This means the bus cost is $56.

Now, to find the total cost for the trip, we add the hotel cost and the bus cost:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

So, Helen paid a total of $296 for the hotel and bus travels. The correct answer is:

Dexter has 5 pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. So, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, for 5 pigs:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

In a week (7 days), the total feed consumed by all pigs is:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. So, the amount of feed left after a week is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Charisma does meditation in the morning and at night. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, so that's 30 minutes a day. She does this 5 days a week. So, in one week, she does 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes. Over 4 weeks, she does 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes on meditation.

She also does yoga. She does 1 hour of yoga each day, and 1 hour is 60 minutes. She does this 5 days a week, so in one week, she does 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes. Over 4 weeks, she does 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes on yoga.

Now, to find out how much time she spends on both meditation and yoga, we add the time she spends on meditation and the time she spends on yoga. So, 600 minutes + 1200 minutes = 1800 minutes.

To change 1800 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 because 60 minutes make 1 hour. So, 1800 minutes ÷ 60 = 30 hours.

The correct answer is 30 hours."
"To find out how many square feet the quilt is, we need to add up the square feet from all the t-shirts Octavia is using.

First, we calculate the square feet from the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
- So, the total square feet from small t-shirts is \(11 \times 3 = 33\) square feet.

Next, we calculate the square feet from the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, the total square feet from medium t-shirts is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.

Then, we calculate the square feet from the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
- So, the total square feet from large t-shirts is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

Now, we add up all the square feet:
- Total square feet = square feet from small t-shirts + square feet from medium t-shirts + square feet from large t-shirts
- Total square feet = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

So, the quilt is 101 square feet. The correct answer is C."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt costs $8 and the second T-shirt costs $8 * 0.5 = $4. So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. So, the discount on the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $16. Therefore, the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends. The total amount spent is $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36. The correct answer is C."

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the money he has by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ 13 \div 6.5 = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The correct answer is:
2"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Ellen bought two things:
- Leggings for $100
- A photo frame for $5

So, Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought:
- Sunglasses for $30
- Two bathrobes, each costing $100

So, Lani spent $30 + $100 + $100 = $230.

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add what Ellen spent and what Lani spent:
$105 + $230 = $335.

So, they spent a total of $335. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tim makes a mix that needs:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit
- 2 pounds of honey

The cost of each ingredient is:
- Passion fruit costs $6 per pound
- Jackfruit costs $8 per pound
- Honey costs $10 per pound

First, we calculate the cost for one jar:
- Passion fruit cost: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit cost: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey cost: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Now, we add up the costs of all the ingredients for one jar:
$12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Tim sells each jar for $50. So, for 10 jars, the total revenue is:
$50/jar * 10 jars = $500

The cost for 10 jars is $440. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
$500 - $440 = $60

So, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60. The correct answer is:

C"
"To find the total amount of money in the jar, we need to add up the value of all the coins Justin has. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents, which is the same as $0.25.
   - So, the total value of the quarters is \(32 \times 0.25 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth 10 cents, which is the same as $0.10.
   - So, the total value of the dimes is \(95 \times 0.10 = 9.50\) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth 5 cents, which is the same as $0.05.
   - So, the total value of the nickels is \(120 \times 0.05 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Pennies:**
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth 1 cent, which is the same as $0.01.
   - So, the total value of the pennies is \(750 \times 0.01 = 7.50\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these values to get the total amount of money in the jar:
\[8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31\]

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\).

The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Janet spent money on three things:
1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets: $7.50 each for two people, so that's $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add up all the money she spent:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the $40:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has $13.00 left. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"
"Josh works 5 days a week because he doesn't work on Sunday and Wednesday. If he services 3 cars each day, then in one week he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

He gets paid $4 for each car he services. So, in one week, he makes:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks. So, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The correct answer is 120 dollars."
"Let's count the cookies step by step:

1. Randy starts with:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. He eats 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 sugar cookie for an early snack:
   - Oatmeal cookies left: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
   - Chocolate chip cookies left: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
   - Sugar cookies left: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal cookies left: \(8 - 2 = 6\)

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar cookies left: \(4 - 2 = 2\)

5. He bakes 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies for dinner:
   - Oatmeal cookies now: \(6 + 4 = 10\)
   - Chocolate chip cookies now: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
   - Sugar cookies now: \(2 + 4 = 6\)

Now, let's add up all the cookies he has now:
- Oatmeal cookies: 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 7
- Sugar cookies: 6

Total cookies: \(10 + 7 + 6 = 23\)

So, the total number of cookies Randy has now is 23. The correct answer is:

"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell them to a buyer who will pay $5 for half of the soldiers and $7 for the other half. Let's break it down:

First, we find out how many soldiers are in each half:
- Half of 12 is 6 soldiers.

Now, we calculate how much money Matthew will get from selling the first half:
- 6 soldiers at $5 each is \(6 \times 5 = 30\) dollars.

Next, we calculate how much money Matthew will get from selling the other half:
- 6 soldiers at $7 each is \(6 \times 7 = 42\) dollars.

To find the total money Matthew will earn, we add the money from both halves:
- \(30 + 42 = 72\) dollars.

So, Matthew will earn 72 dollars. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate is on vacation for 14 days. So, the dog digs:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate comes back, the dog digs 6 holes a day, but Nate fills 9 holes a day. So, the net change in holes per day is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes. Since the dog digs 3 holes more than Nate fills each day, we can calculate the number of days it takes to fill the holes by dividing the total number of holes by the net change per day:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it takes. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Norman High School has 4000 students on average each year. Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman High School.

First, we need to find out how many students Butler High School has. We do this by multiplying 4000 by 3/4:

\[ 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 4000 \times 0.75 = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School has 3000 students on average each year.

Now, we need to find out how much greater the number of students at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School:

\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School.

The correct answer is:
**A. 1000**"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

First, let's add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:

"Let's break it down step by step again, but in a simpler way.

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Igor got:
- Half as many test tubes as asked, so he got 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Two more Petri dishes than asked, so he got 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- The same number of beakers as asked, so he got 7 beakers.

Now, let's see how many items Igor got in total:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Total items Igor got: 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 items.

Dr. Grumpus asked for:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Total items Dr. Grumpus asked for: 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 items.

So, Igor lost some items. The total number of items Igor lost is: 37 - 31 = 6 items.

Igor lost 1 beaker because he got 7 beakers and lost 6 items, and the only way to lose 6 items and still have 7 beakers is to lose 1 beaker.

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"James is making 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. So, for 4 tables, he needs:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs} \]

Each leg needs 2 screws, so for 16 legs, he needs:
\[ 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the screws he needs from the screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, James will have 8 screws left over. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

We have 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so we need to find out how many eggs are in the second basket.

If the first basket has 10 eggs, then the second basket has:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, to find out how many eggs are in both baskets together, we add the eggs from both baskets:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know how much each person raised:
- Alexandra raised $430.
- Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raised $300.
- Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up all the money they raised:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

So, the total is $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180.

The total amount of money they raised is $2180."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Vanessa runs a mile in a certain time, Aaron runs the same mile in half that time.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since Aaron runs twice as fast, he would run 8 miles in the same time Vanessa runs 4 miles.
3. We know Aaron took 16 minutes to run 8 miles. So, we can find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles by comparing the distances they ran.

If Aaron ran 8 miles in 16 minutes, then to find out how long it took him to run 1 mile, we divide 16 minutes by 8:
\[ \text{Time for 1 mile} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{8} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Vanessa runs at half the speed of Aaron, it will take her twice as long to run 1 mile. So, to run 1 mile, it will take her:
\[ \text{Time for 1 mile} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find out how long it took her to run 4 miles, we multiply the time it takes her to run 1 mile by 4:
\[ \text{Time for 4 miles} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The correct answer is:
**B**"
"The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock. So, for 200 feet of dock, he needs 200 times 3 feet of line, which is 600 feet of line. He already has 6 feet, so he needs 600 - 6 = 594 feet more. The correct answer is C."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simple way.

1. Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations each night.
2. Each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
3. So, the cost for one reservation is:
   - 2 meals at $5 each = $5
   - 1 bottle of wine = $5
   - Total cost per reservation = $5 + $5 = $10
4. Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, so they get 6 reservations each night for 2 nights, which is:
   - 6 reservations/night × 2 nights/week = 12 reservations/week
5. The total cost for 12 reservations in a week is:
   - 12 reservations/week × $10/reservation = $120/week

So, Tom's restaurant makes $120 a week. The correct answer is C."
"The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He made a profit of 25% on the cost price. To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to know the total selling price.

The profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = 25\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know James is 18 years old now.
2. James is twice as old as his sister Dora. So, Dora is 18 / 2 = 9 years old.
3. Dora will be 12 years old in 3 years, so she is 9 years old now.
4. John was 19 when James was born, so John is 18 years older than James. That means John is 18 + 18 = 36 years old now.
5. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 36 - 32 = 4 years old now.
6. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 4 + 3 = 7 years old.

So, the youngest son will be 7 years old in 3 years. The correct answer is not listed among the options, but if we had to choose, it would be:

B (if B is 7)"
"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to figure out how many oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's see how many oranges Ana can peel in one minute. Since it takes Ana 3 minutes to peel one orange, in one minute she can peel \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.

Next, let's see how many oranges Jane can peel in one minute. Since it takes Jane 4 minutes to peel one orange, in one minute she can peel \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (which is an hour).

For Ana:
- In 60 minutes, she can peel \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.

For Jane:
- In 60 minutes, she can peel \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, the new radiator costs $400, but Mark gets it at 80% off. So, he only pays 20% of $400.

20% of $400 is:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs $80.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. It takes 3 hours and the mechanic charges $50 per hour.

The cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator to the cost of the mechanic:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, Mark paid $230 in total.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and all of them are either chickens or cows. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 70.

First, let's think about how many legs we would have if all 20 animals were cows. Since cows have 4 legs each, 20 cows would have:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

But we know the total number of legs is 70, which is less than 80. This means not all animals are cows. So, some of the animals must be chickens, which have 2 legs each.

If we have chickens, the number of legs from the chickens will be less than 80. Let's say we have \( C \) chickens. Then the number of legs from the chickens is \( 2C \).

The number of cows will be \( 20 - C \) because the total number of animals is 20.

The total number of legs from the cows is:
\[ (20 - C) \times 4 \]

So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70 \]
\[ 2C + 80 - 4C = 70 \]
\[ -2C + 80 = 70 \]
\[ -2C = 70 - 80 \]
\[ -2C = -10 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens. The number of cows is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

To check, if we have 5 chickens and 15 cows:
- Chickens have \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs.
- Cows have \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.
- Total legs are \( 10 + 60 = 70 \), which matches the given total.

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. They have 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, we first find out how many slices there are in total:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to share these 56 slices equally among the 4 people. To find out how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person, including Henry, gets 14 slices. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
