Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in the second house.
   - Flutist: House 2

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent, and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the carnations and the bouquet of lilies must be adjacent, and the person with the carnations must be to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.
   - Since the flutist lives in house number 2, the pianist must live in either house number 3 or house number 4.

Let's consider the possible positions for the pianist:

### Case 1: Pianist lives in house number 3
- If the pianist lives in house number 3, then the guitarist must live in house number 2 (since the flutist is already in house number 2), which contradicts the fact that the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips. Therefore, the pianist cannot live in house number 3.

### Case 2: Pianist lives in house number 4
- If the pianist lives in house number 4, then the guitarist must live in house number 3 (since the flutist is in house number 2 and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips).

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- The person with the bouquet of lilies must be to the left of the person with the carnations arrangement.
- The person with the vase of tulips must be to the left of the guitarist (house number 3).

Let's place the remaining flowers and instruments:

- The person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house number 1 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).
- The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 4 (since house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist and house number 4 is occupied by the pianist).

This leaves house number 1 for the person with the bouquet of lilies and house number 4 for the person with the carnations arrangement. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 2 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).

Thus, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints and the logical analysis, let's re-evaluate the clues step by step to determine the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

### Clue Analysis

1. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
2. **The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.**
3. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.**
4. **There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.**
5. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
6. **The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
7. **The percussionist does not live in the second house.**
8. **The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.**

### Initial Setup

- **House 1:** The person who is eating kiwis.
- **House 2:** The person who likes green.
- **House 3:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy (they live next to each other).

### Clue 8
- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
  - House 1: Eating kiwis.

### Clue 5
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
  - House 1: Green (this is consistent with Clue 8).

### Clue 6
- The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
  - This means the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

### Clue 7
- The percussionist does not live in the second house.
  - This means the percussionist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

### Clue 3
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
  - This means the person who only drinks water must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

### Clue 2
- The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
  - This means the person who has a television must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

### Clue 1
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
  - This means the root beer lover must be to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

### Combining Clues

Given Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3.

### Final Arrangement

- **House 1:** Green (person who likes green)
- **House 2:** Blue (person who likes blue) and Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)
- **House 3:** Root beer (person who drinks root beer) and Kiwis (person who eats kiwis)

Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3, and the person who drinks root beer must be to the left of the person who drinks root beer, the only possible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** Green
- **House 2:** Blue, Gameboy
- **House 3:** Root beer, Kiwis

Thus, the cellist must live in house 3.

"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's reorganize the information step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house (House 3).
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
12. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 2**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - This directly tells us that the grilled cheese eater lives in house number 5.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in one of the houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the root beer lover and the person who had stew are neighbors, with the root beer lover being to the left of the person who had stew.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house number 5.

5. **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who ate spaghetti are neighbors, with the coffee drinker being to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors.

From Clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives in house number 5. From Clue 1, we know the grilled cheese eater also lives in house number 5. This means the grilled cheese eater and the person who only drinks water are in the same house, which is house number 5.

From Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 3. From Clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the coffee drinker must live in house number 2. This means the person who ate spaghetti (in house 3) and the coffee drinker (in house 2) are neighbors.

From Clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew. Since the person who ate spaghetti (in house 3) and the coffee drinker (in house 2) are neighbors, the person who had stew must be in house 4. The root beer lover must be in house 3, but since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes milk.

Summarizing the arrangement:
- House 1: Person who likes milk
- House 2: Person who drinks coffee
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who only drinks water (and also the grilled cheese eater)

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the soccer player and the person eating oranges cannot be in houses 1 and 3, but they must be in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges.

From Clue 1, the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 4, the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges, which means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 and the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person with daffodils is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos must be in house 1 (as the swimmer is in house 1 and the person with daffodils is in house 2), the person with tulips must be in house 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person with daffodils
- House 3: Person with tulips

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. **Violinist in House 1**
   - Violinist: House 1

2. **History book buff in House 3**
   - History book buff: House 3

3. **Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone are next to each other**
   - This means they must be in Houses 2 and 3 in some order.

4. **Person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist**
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (where the violinist lives) and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2.

5. **Person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 1 or House 3.

6. **Person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist**
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 3 (where the person who ate fried rice lives).

7. **There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives**
   - This means the person with a radio must be in House 2 (since the history book buff is in House 3).

8. **Person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist**
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (where the violinist lives) and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2.

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining elements:

- **Radio in House 2**
- **History book buff in House 3**

Now, we need to place the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone. Since they must be next to each other and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist, we can deduce:

- If the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in House 1, then the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone must be in Houses 2 and 3. But since the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone are next to each other, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in House 1, the only possible arrangement is:
  - Person with a vase of tulips in House 2
  - Person with a phone in House 3

This leaves House 1 for the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's re-evaluate the placement of each person and their attributes:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the person who lives in the second house (Clue 2). This person is the mystery book reader.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Next, we use Clue 3 and Clue 6 to place the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast. The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the history book buff. The history book buff must be directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in House 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 5 to place the percussionist. The percussionist must be directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the computer must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the person who has a gameboy. The person who has a gameboy must be directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Finally, we use Clue 8 to place the cellist. The cellist cannot be in House 3. Since the cellist is not in House 3, the cellist must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy is in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the rose bouquet is in House 3, the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person wearing boots lives in house 2.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person driving a convertible must live in house 1 (since the convertible driver must be directly left of the history book buff, and the history book buff cannot be in house 1).

Therefore, the person driving a truck must live in house 2 (since the person driving a truck is the only other car type left).

Now, let's assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is not wearing boots, so they must be wearing sandals.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is not wearing boots, so they must be wearing boots.
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is not a history book buff, so they must be a mystery book reader.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is a history book buff.

Thus, the person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Given the constraints and the domain expertise of an expert in logic grid puzzles, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From Clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

Now, let's use the other clues to determine the remaining houses:

- **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.
- **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in either the first or third house.
- **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. This means the history book buff cannot live in the first house, and the person who is wearing loafers cannot live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the remaining people:

1. The third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
2. The person wearing high heels cannot be in the second house, so they must be in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
3. The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (second house) must be to the right of each other. This means the person wearing loafers must be in the fourth house.
4. The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the first and fourth houses are occupied, the only remaining houses are the second and third. The person wearing sandals must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing high heels
- Second house: Person wearing sandals
- Third house: Mystery book reader
- Fourth house: Person wearing loafers

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as positions 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 3** tells us that the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in either house 1 or house 3.

#### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

#### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the coffee drinker lives.

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's summarize the information we have so far:
- The third house is occupied by the root beer lover.
- The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
- The tea drinker is not in the second house.

Let's try to place the people based on the clues:

1. The root beer lover is in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker is not in the second house.

If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers:

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (House 1).**
2. **Fish enthusiast does not live in the first house (House 1).**
   - Therefore, the fish enthusiast must live in House 2.
3. **Person who had pizza does not live in the first house (House 1).**
   - Therefore, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.
4. **Person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - Since the fish enthusiast (who likes green) lives in House 2, the person who has a radio must live in House 1.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in House 2) and the person who likes green (in House 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in House 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in House 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in House 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in House 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in House 2).

Thus, the person who is a cat lover lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Dog owner** lives in the second house.
2. **Stew** does not live in the third, fourth, or fifth house.
3. **Milk** and **blue** are directly left and right of each other. Since **dog owner** is in the second house, **milk** and **blue** cannot be in the first or second house. Therefore, **milk** must be in the first house and **blue** in the third house.
4. **Bird keeper** and **history book buff** are directly left and right of each other. Since **bird keeper** cannot be in the first house and **history book buff** cannot be in the third house, **bird keeper** must be in the first house and **history book buff** in the second house.
5. **Spaghetti** lives somewhere to the left of **red**. Since **red** cannot be in the first or second house, **spaghetti** must be in the first house and **red** in the fourth house.
6. **Fried rice** lives somewhere to the left of **horses**. Since **horses** cannot be in the first or second house, **fried rice** must be in the first house and **horses** in the third house.
7. **Bird keeper** (first house) and **fish enthusiast** are one house apart. Since **fish enthusiast** cannot be in the first or second house, **fish enthusiast** must be in the third house.
8. **Root beer** lives directly left of the **romance book lover**. Since **romance book lover** cannot be in the first or second house, **root beer** must be in the first house and **romance book lover** in the second house.
9. **Stew** does not live in the third, fourth, or fifth house.
10. **Coffee** lives somewhere to the right of the **dog owner**. Since **dog owner** is in the second house, **coffee** must be in the fifth house.
11. **Pizza** and **fantasy book enthusiast** live directly next to each other. Since **fantasy book enthusiast** cannot be in the first or second house, **fantasy book enthusiast** must be in the fourth house and **pizza** in the third house.
12. **Science fiction book fanatic** does not live in the second house. Since **science fiction book fanatic** cannot be in the first, second, or fifth house, **science fiction book fanatic** must be in the third house.
13. **Yellow** lives somewhere to the left of the **romance book lover**. Since **romance book lover** is in the second house, **yellow** must be in the first house.
14. **Tea** lives directly left of the **white**. Since **tea** is already in the first house, **white** must be in the second house.

From the final arrangement:
- **House 1**: Yellow, Tea, Stew
- **House 2**: White, Romance book lover, Root beer
- **House 3**: Science fiction book fanatic, Pizza, Fish enthusiast
- **House 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast, Horses, Spaghetti
- **House 5**: Coffee, Dog owner, Milk

The person who only drinks water lives in the **first house**.

Thus, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and clues, let's deduce the correct house where the person who is eating kiwis lives step by step:

1. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Person eating kiwis

2. **Clue 10:** The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.

3. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

4. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must live in house 2, 3, or 4.

   - Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2 or 4.

7. **Clue 13:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - Since the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts Clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible placements:

- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2 or 4.

Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 13, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis

- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the constraints and the domain expertise of an expert in logic grid puzzles, let's reanalyze the clues with a focus on the logical deductions:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner lives in house \(X\), the tulip owner lives in house \(X-1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the daffodils owner cannot live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the carnations owner lives in house \(X+1\) or \(X-1\).

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the lilies owner lives in house \(X+1\) or higher.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover lives in house 1.

Given the cat lover lives in house 1, we can start filling in the houses:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Daffodils (from Clue 2)
- House 3: Horse (from Clue 4, since the lilies owner must be to the right of the horse owner)
- House 4: Dog (from Clue 1, since the tulip owner must be to the left of the dog owner)
- House 5: Fish (remaining pet)

Now, let's verify the remaining clues:

- **Clue 1:** The tulip owner lives in house 4, and the dog owner lives in house 5.
- **Clue 2:** The daffodils owner lives in house 2.
- **Clue 3:** The horse owner lives in house 3, and the carnations owner lives in house 4 (which is consistent with the dog owner living in house 5).
- **Clue 4:** The lilies owner lives in house 4 (which is consistent with the dog owner living in house 5).
- **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in house 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast must live in house 5.

The number of the house where the fish enthusiast lives is \(\boxed{5}\).

However, since the options provided are (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 1, (D) 4, and house 5 is not an option, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the options. Based on the given clues and logical deductions, the correct answer should be house 5."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the characteristics of each person and their house numbers.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

Let's summarize what we know so far:
- House 1: Has a phone (Clue 1)
- House 2: Does not wear boots (Clue 2)
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio (Clue 3)

Since the person in house 1 has a phone, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots (since the person in house 2 does not wear boots). Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Now, let's determine the pets and devices:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 cannot have a phone (because the person in house 1 has a phone), the person in house 1 must own horses. The person in house 2 must have a radio.

So, the characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

### Clues Recap:
1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Identify the baseball player
From clue 3, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

#### Step 2: Identify the basketball player
From clue 1, the basketball player does not live in the first house. From clue 2, the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Therefore, the basketball player must be in either House 1 or House 2. Since the baseball player is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

#### Step 3: Identify the swimmer
From clue 2, the basketball player (House 1) lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the basketball player is in House 1, the swimmer must be in House 2 or House 3. But since the baseball player is already in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 3. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

#### Step 4: Identify the tennis player and cat lover
From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the baseball player is in House 2 and the swimmer is in House 3, the tennis player must be in House 3 and the cat lover must be in House 4. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

#### Step 5: Identify the fish enthusiast and bird keeper
From clue 4, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 4, the dog owner must be in House 3. So, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4. This leaves the bird keeper to be in House 1. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

### Conclusion:
The bird keeper lives in House 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

### Clue Analysis

1. **White and Computer:**
   - The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - This means the computer owner cannot be in the first house, and the white lover cannot be in the first house either.

2. **Baseball Player and Blue:**
   - There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - This means the baseball player must be in house 2, and the person who likes blue must be in house 3.

3. **Sedan and SUV:**
   - The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the sedan owner and the SUV owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Sedan and Gameboy:**
   - The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - This means the sedan owner and the gameboy owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

5. **Violinist and First House:**
   - The violinist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the violinist must live in either house 2 or 3.

6. **Guitarist and White:**
   - The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the guitarist must live in a house to the right of the white lover.

### Deduction

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

From clue 1, we know:
- The computer owner cannot be in house 1, and the white lover cannot be in house 1.

From clue 3, we know:
- The sedan and SUV owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 4, we know:
- The sedan and gameboy owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 5, we know:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1.

From clue 6, we know:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover.

### Combining Clues

Let's start by placing the known elements:

- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

Now, let's place the sedan and SUV:
- If the sedan is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (but house 2 is already taken by the baseball player).
- Therefore, the sedan must be in house 2, and the SUV must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

Now, we need to place the violinist and the white lover:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.
- The white lover must be in house 1 or 3.

Since the white lover cannot be in house 1 (because the computer owner is there), the white lover must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 2 for the sedan owner.

Now, we need to place the guitarist and the gameboy:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover (house 3), so the guitarist must be in house 3.
- The gameboy must be next to the sedan owner (house 2).

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

### Final Arrangement

- House 1: Computer owner
- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Person who likes blue

The remaining characteristics:
- The white lover is in house 3.
- The guitar is in house 3.
- The gameboy is in house 2.
- The violinist is in house 2.
- The baseball player is in house 2.
- The soccer player is in house 1.

Thus, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house (Clue 11).
- The person who had fried rice lives in the second house (Clue 5).

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live next to each other. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in the second and fourth houses. Given that the person who had pizza does not live in the third house (Clue 4), the person who had pizza must be in the second house, and the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who owns horses must be in the first or second house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who has a phone is in the fourth house, the person who owns horses must be in the first house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. The bird keeper must be in the second or third house, but since the cat lover is in the third house, the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the person who has a television must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who has a phone is in the fourth house, the person who has a television must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third or fourth house. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the fourth house, the person who had stew must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had stew is in the fifth house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house, but we already know the person who had fried rice is in the second house. This indicates a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating the positions:
- First house: Person who has a phone (Clue 1)
- Second house: Person who had pizza (Clue 1)
- Third house: Cat lover (Clue 2)
- Fourth house: Person who has a television (Clue 7)
- Fifth house: Person who had stew (Clue 9)

Since the person who had fried rice must be in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the second house, this is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating again:
- First house: Person who has a phone (Clue 1)
- Second house: Person who had pizza (Clue 1)
- Third house: Cat lover (Clue 2)
- Fourth house: Person who had fried rice (Clue 10)
- Fifth house: Person who had stew (Clue 9)

Since the person who had fried rice is in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza is in the second house, the person who has a television must be in the third house, the person who has a gameboy must be in the fifth house, the person who owns horses must be in the first house, and the person who had stew must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other, and the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other, and the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

- **House 3**: Person wearing running shoes (Rsh)
- **House 2**: Percussionist (Perc)

Finally, we need to place the person with a television directly left of the person eating oranges.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

- **House 3**: Person wearing running shoes (Rsh)
- **House 2**: Percussionist (Perc)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- **Pianist (P) is in house 1**.
- **Person wearing high heels (H) is in house 2**.
- **Pianist (P) and person wearing high heels (H) are next to each other**.
- **Person eating oranges (O) is in house 4**.
- **Person eating kiwis (K) is in house 5**.
- **Person eating kiwis (K) is to the left of person wearing boots (B)**.
- **Person wearing high heels (H) and person with a radio (R) are next to each other**.
- **Person eating oranges (O) is directly left of person with a television (T)**.

Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."

"Given the constraints and the refined persona of an expert in logic grid puzzles, let's reanalyze the clues with a focus on the logical deductions:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - This means the history book buff lives in house number 1.

2. There is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives.
   - Since the history book buff lives in house number 1, the person who had stew must live in either house number 2 or 3.
   - Given that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house, the person who had stew cannot live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the person who had stew must live in house number 3.

3. There is one house between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who had stew lives.
   - The person who had stew lives in house number 3.
   - There must be one house between the person who had pizza and the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had pizza must live in house number 2.

4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.
   - This confirms that the person who had pizza lives in house number 2.

Based on these deductions, the history book buff lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the constraints and the logical analysis, let's re-evaluate the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - This directly tells us that the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who owns a sedan can live in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the minivan driver and the high heels wearer must be adjacent to each other.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the sandals wearer and the convertible driver must be adjacent to each other.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - This means the running shoes wearer and the boots wearer must be adjacent to each other.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 4.

Let's place the person who owns an SUV in house 4:
- House 4: SUV

Since the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4, the person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 1) must live in house 1.

Now, we need to place the remaining people (sandals, high heels, convertible, sedan) in houses 2, 3, and 5, keeping in mind Clue 2 and Clue 4.

- **Clue 2:** The person who owns a sedan does not live in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.

Let's try to place the remaining people:

- If the person wearing sandals lives in house 3, then the person who drives a convertible must live in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by the person who owns an SUV).
- Therefore, the person wearing sandals must live in house 3, and the person who drives a convertible must live in house 5.

Now, we need to place the person who drives a minivan and the person who is wearing high heels:

- The person who drives a minivan must live in house 3 (since the person wearing sandals lives in house 3).
- The person who is wearing high heels must live in house 5 (since the person who drives a minivan lives in house 3 and they must be adjacent).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Minivan, Sandals
- House 4: SUV
- House 5: High heels, Convertible

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the constraints and the logical analysis, let's re-evaluate the placement of the individuals based on the clues:

1. **Cricketer lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Cricketer

2. **The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means the sedan owner and the cat lover are not in adjacent houses.

3. **The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means the sedan owner and the horse owner are adjacent.

4. **The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.**
   - This means the truck driver and the basketball player are not in adjacent houses.

Let's place the people in the houses:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: (S, C, H, T)
- House 3: (S, C, H, T)

Since the cricketer is in house 1, the sedan owner (S) and the horse owner (H) must be in houses 2 and 3. Also, the cat lover (C) must be in a house adjacent to the sedan owner (S) or the horse owner (H).

Let's try placing the sedan owner (S) and the horse owner (H) in houses 2 and 3:

- House 2: S (sedan owner)
- House 3: H (horse owner)

This leaves the cat lover (C) and the truck driver (T) to be placed in houses 2 and 3. Since the cat lover (C) must be adjacent to the sedan owner (S), and the horse owner (H) is already in house 3, the cat lover (C) must be in house 2. This leaves the truck driver (T) to be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Cat lover (C)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)

Since the truck driver (T) lives in house 3, the basketball player (B) must live in house 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

   - This means the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Now, let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.
- From Clue 5, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's reanalyze the information:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement step by step to determine the house where the person who owns an SUV lives.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

Let's verify if this fits with the other clues:

2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - If the SUV owner is in house 3, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 must be the person who drives a convertible.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. But house 1 is already taken by the person who drives a convertible, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - The person who drives a convertible is in house 1, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - The person who drives a minivan must be in house 2 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible), and the dog owner must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
   - The person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, and house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV). The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 4. Since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The bird keeper is in house 4, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

8. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - The person who drives a minivan is in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, the history book buff must be in house 1.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos), and the romance book lover must be in house 4.

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
    - The person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

Given all these clues, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Person who drives a convertible
- House 2: Person who is eating mangos
- House 3: Person who owns an SUV
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's reorganize the information step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person with a rose bouquet lives in house 2.
   - House 2: Rose bouquet.

2. **Clue 1**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the television and the tea drinker must be in adjacent houses. Since the rose bouquet is in house 2, the television must be in house 1 and the tea drinker must be in house 3.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker must be in a house with a lower number than the person eating kiwis. Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 or 2. Given the television is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 already has the rose bouquet), so the coffee drinker must be in house 1. Therefore, the person eating kiwis must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - Since the television is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2. But house 2 already has the rose bouquet, so the guitarist must be in house 3.

5. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means if the flutist lives in house 1, the person eating a banana must live in house 3.
   - If the flutist lives in house 2, the person eating a banana must live in house 1.
   - If the flutist lives in house 3, the person eating a banana must live in house 2.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means if the person with a vase of tulips is in house 3, the person with a radio must be in house 1.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2, the person with a radio must be in house 1.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 1, the person with a radio must be in house 1.

7. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This is already satisfied as the tea drinker is in house 3.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Radio, banana, tulips.
- House 2: Rose bouquet, guitarist.
- House 3: Television, kiwis, coffee.

The root beer lover must live in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 1"
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

1. **Clue 7**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - So, the third house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast.

2. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
   - This means the person eating apples and the person wearing boots must be in houses 2 and 4 or 1 and 3.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 2**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in either the fourth house or the fifth house (but since there are only 4 houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house).

7. **Clue 1**: The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the second house.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person eating a banana must live in either the fourth or the fifth house. But since there are only 4 houses, the person eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Second house: History book buff
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic (from Clue 2 and Clue 6)
- First house: Person eating mangos (from Clue 5 and Clue 3)
- Fourth house: Person eating a banana (from Clue 8)
- Fifth house: Person eating apples (from Clue 4 and Clue 3)

Since the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house, and the fourth house is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person eating apples must live in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: History book buff
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's summarize the information:

1. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house (number 1). Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house (number 2).
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house (number 2). Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house (number 1).
3. The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the flutist lives in the first house (number 1), the person who likes white must live in the second house (number 2).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house (number 2), the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house (number 1).

From these deductions:
- First house (number 1): Flutist, wearing loafers, owns an SUV
- Second house (number 2): Person who likes white, wearing sandals, owns an SUV

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2).

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the violinist lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other.

From Clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house (house 3).

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (Clue 3), the person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who drives a minivan must live in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the sedan owner cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), the sedan owner must be in house 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3. But house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the sedan owner must be in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who is eating apples must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the sedan owner and the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 1, and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From Clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

From Clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1 or 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.

12. **Clue 12:** The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
    - House 2: High heels

17. **Clue 17:** The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
    - House 4: Blue

18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
    - House 3: Not boots

19. **Clue 19:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
    - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes white must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew
- House 4: Blue, loafers, not white
- House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew
- House 6: Not white, not red, not stew

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The correct answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person living in the first house (house 1) has a television. Since the person in the first house has a television, the person in the second house (house 2) must have the computer (since there is only one computer and one television).

From clue 1, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house (house 2).

Now we know:
- The person in the first house (house 1) has a television.
- The person in the second house (house 2) has a computer.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints and the logical analysis, let's re-evaluate the arrangement step by step:

### Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
- This means the science fiction book fanatic (SFF) and the golfer (Golfer) must be in different houses, and Golfer must be to the left of SFF.
- Possible positions: Golfer in House 1, SFF in House 2.

### Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
- This means the pizza-eater (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) must be in adjacent houses.
- Possible positions: PE in House 1, HBB in House 2 or PE in House 2, HBB in House 1.

### Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- This means the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D.
- Possible positions: G in House 2, D in House 1 or G in House 1, D in House 2.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1, Golfer is in House 1 and SFF is in House 2.
- From Clue 2, PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since Golfer is in House 1, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.
- From Clue 3, G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 1, G and D must be in House 2.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 1, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 1 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 1.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.
   - House 1: Lilies

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in house 1.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This implies that the person eating apples must be in house 1 (since house 2 is for the basketball player).

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person eating apples (house 1) is to the right of the person eating apples, the person eating apples must be the one who is eating apples.
   - Therefore, the person who has a radio must be in house 2, and the violinist must be in house 2.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the violinist lives in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct house for the cricketer:

1. **Tennis player lives in the 3rd house.**
2. **Grilled cheese lives in the 5th house.**
3. **Golfer lives in the 4th house.**
4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**

Let's start by placing the known individuals:

- **Tennis player:** 3rd house
- **Grilled cheese:** 5th house
- **Golfer:** 4th house

This leaves the following houses for the remaining individuals (1st, 2nd, and 5th houses are occupied):

- **Stew:** 1st house (since it must be directly left of spaghetti)
- **Spaghetti:** 3rd house (since it must be directly right of stew)
- **Pizza:** 2nd house (since it must be to the left of the cricketer)
- **Cricketer:** 2nd house (since pizza is to the left of the cricketer)

Thus, the cricketer lives in the 2nd house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (house 2).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who likes white must live in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

From the above deductions:
- **House 1:** 
  - Person who only drinks water
  - Person who likes white
  - Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2)
  
- **House 2:** 
  - Person who only drinks water (lives in house 1)
  - Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2)
  - Person who likes red (lives in house 2)
  - Person who plays baseball (lives in house 1)
  - Person who wears loafers (lives in house 2)

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(A) 2**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct placement of each person and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to the houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively. We will use the clues to deduce the positions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

**Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's reanalyze the information:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Now, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Boots wearer
- House 3: Fried rice eater

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person eating grapes does not live in the first house (Clue 1).
2. The baseball player lives in the second house (Clue 2).
3. The person driving a convertible lives in the second house (Clue 3).

From Clue 2, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible also lives in the second house. Since the baseball player and the person driving a convertible must be different individuals (as they have different characteristics), the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

Therefore, the person eating mangos must live in the first house.

The number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the positions of the people and their characteristics.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes blue is in house number 2.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 3. But since the person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person who is eating apples is in house 1 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3. But we already know the person who likes blue is in house 2, so the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since the person who likes blue is in house 2 and the person who likes white must be in house 3).
   - Therefore, the person who likes white must be in house 3.

So, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 3 (but there is no house 3, so this is not possible).

2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses, with the soccer player in house 1 and the mystery book reader in house 2, or vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the person with the gameboy must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person with the gameboy is in house 1.
- The mystery book reader is in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player is in house 1 (since the mystery book reader is in house 2).

From Clue 1, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 (since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct placement of each person and their respective pets and cars.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.

### Deductions:
- **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses.
- **Clue 2:** There are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
- **Clue 3:** The truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses.
- **Clue 1:** The minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Position of the Dog Owner and Truck:**
   - Since the truck and the sedan must be adjacent, and there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner, the truck and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
   - The fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be adjacent, so they cannot be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the fish enthusiast and the dog owner.

2. **Position of the Fish Enthusiast and Dog Owner:**
   - The fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in houses 1 and 4.
   - Since the truck and the sedan must be adjacent, and the truck cannot be in house 1 (because the fish enthusiast is there), the truck must be in house 2 and the sedan in house 3.

3. **Position of the Minivan:**
   - The minivan must be to the right of the fish enthusiast, so it must be in house 4.

4. **Position of the Cat Lover:**
   - The cat lover cannot be in house 2 (truck) or house 4 (minivan).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1.

### Final Configuration:
- **House 1:** Cat Lover (minivan)
- **House 2:** Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- **House 3:** Dog Owner (sedan)
- **House 4:** Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

2. **Clue 4**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."

- **House 3:** Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes, Person wearing loafers.

### Deduction

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - Since the cricketer is in house 3, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 2.
   - Given that house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue, the person eating oranges must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - The baseball player must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the person eating oranges).
   - The cat lover must be in house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - The basketball player must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the baseball player).

6. **Clue 7:** The person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.
   - The person wearing loafers must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cat lover and the person who likes green).

### Conclusion

The person who likes white (the only color left) must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (as house 1 is taken by the dog owner and baseball player), the bird keeper must be in house 3.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

Let's analyze the possible positions:

- If the cellist is in house 1, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 2 (since the cellist is to the left of the gameboy owner).
- If the cellist is in house 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 1 (but this contradicts the first clue since the cellist would then be to the right of the gameboy owner).

Therefore, the only consistent arrangement is:
- Cellist in house 1
- Gameboy owner in house 2

This leaves house 1 for the dog owner.

Thus, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who owns an SUV lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person with a phone and the person with an SUV must be adjacent, and the phone must be to the left of the SUV.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

Given the constraints:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, we can deduce the following:
- The person with a phone must be in house 2 (since house 1 is occupied by the minivan and house 3 is occupied by the gameboy).
- The person with an SUV must be in house 4 (since house 4 is occupied by the radio and the phone must be to the left of the SUV).

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."

2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tulips

3. **Clue 7**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement must be in adjacent houses. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Since the computer is in house 2, the adjacent houses for the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement are houses 1 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since house 3 already has tulips, the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 3. But since house 2 already has a computer, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 4.

   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 4: Carnations arrangement

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the daffodils and radio must be in houses 4 and 5, or 3 and 4, or 2 and 3, or 1 and 2, or 1 and 3. Since house 1 already has a rose bouquet and house 3 has tulips, the only possible pair is houses 2 and 5.

   - House 2: Computer
   - House 5: Daffodils

5. **Clue 1**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the lilies and phone must be in houses 3 and 4, 4 and 5, or 2 and 3, or 1 and 2, or 1 and 3. Since house 3 already has tulips and house 4 has daffodils, the only possible pair is houses 2 and 3.

   - House 2: Computer
   - House 3: Tulips
   - House 4: Daffodils
   - House 5: Lilies

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television.
   - This means the phone and television must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. Since house 2 already has a computer, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 3.

   - House 1: Phone
   - House 3: Tulips
   - House 2: Computer
   - House 4: Daffodils
   - House 5: Lilies

7. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives in the second house. This contradicts Clue 1, so the fish enthusiast must be in a different house. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in the second house.
4. **Clue 6:** The bird keeper lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other. This means the cricketer and the person with loafers must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
6. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person with sandals must live in the third or fifth house.
7. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 10:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
9. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
10. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

Let's start with the bird keeper in the first house:
- **House 1:** Bird Keeper

The cricketer must be in the second house:
- **House 2:** Cricketer, Loafers

The fish enthusiast cannot be in the second house, so the fish enthusiast must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house. Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the fish enthusiast must be in the third house:
- **House 3:** Fish Enthusiast

The person with sandals must be in the third or fifth house. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person with sandals must be in the fifth house:
- **House 5:** Sandals, Baseball Player

The golfer is in the fourth house:
- **House 4:** Golfer

The person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in the fourth house, so the running shoes must be in the fifth house:
- **House 5:** Running Shoes, Baseball Player

The cat lover must be to the right of the golfer, so the cat lover must be in the fifth house:
- **House 5:** Running Shoes, Cat Lover

The person who owns horses must be in the third or fourth house. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house and the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house:
- **House 3:** Horses, Dog Owner

The person who is wearing boots must be in the third or fourth house. Since the horses are in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must be in the fourth house:
- **House 4:** Horses, Golfers

Thus, the dog owner lives in **House 3**.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person living in the two houses:

1. **Root Beer Lover**: Does not live in house 1 (house 2).
2. **Grapes and Computer**: The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with the computer.
3. **Radio and Truck**: The person with the radio and the person driving the truck live next to each other.
4. **Radio and Pizza**: The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
5. **Root Beer Lover**: Does not live in house 1 (house 2).

From clue 5, the root beer lover must be in house 2. From clue 4, the person with the radio must be in house 1 (since they must be to the left of the person who had pizza). From clue 3, the person driving the truck must be in house 1 (since they must be next to the person with the radio). Therefore, the person with the radio and the person driving the truck must be in house 1.

Since the person with the radio is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 1 (as per clue 4). The person eating grapes must be in house 2 (as per clue 2).

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 (pizza) can be either the root beer lover or the water drinker.
- The person in house 2 (grapes) can be either the root beer lover or the water drinker.
- The person in house 1 (pizza) can be either the banana eater or the stew eater.
- The person in house 2 (grapes) can be either the banana eater or the stew eater.
- The person in house 1 (pizza) can be either the truck driver or the minivan driver.
- The person in house 2 (grapes) can be either the truck driver or the minivan driver.

Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the person in house 1 (pizza) must be the water drinker, the banana eater, the minivan driver, and the person with the computer. The person in house 2 (grapes) must be the root beer lover, the water drinker, the stew eater, and the truck driver.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's reorganize the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 5:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the pizza eater must be in House 2.

3. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the white liker and the water drinker must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the spaghetti eater and the water drinker cannot be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 7:** The person who likes green does not live in the first house.
   - The green liker cannot be in House 1.

6. **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - The grilled cheese eater cannot be in House 1.

From Clue 2, we know the tea drinker (House 1) and the pizza eater (House 2) are adjacent. This leaves House 3 and House 4 for the remaining characteristics.

Let's place the remaining characteristics:
- The green liker cannot be in House 1.
- The green liker cannot be in House 4 (since the grilled cheese eater is there).
- The green liker cannot be in House 2 (since the pizza eater is there).
- The green liker must be in House 3.

Let's verify:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza eater
- House 3: Spaghetti eater (adjacent to the water drinker)
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater (adjacent to the pizza eater)

The only house left for the green liker is House 3.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who likes red lives.

1. **Clue 10**: The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.
   - Since the dog owner lives in the third house (Clue 4), the person who is wearing high heels must live in either the first or second house.

2. **Clue 11**: The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - The person who is wearing loafers cannot live in the first house (Clue 7), so they must live in the second or third house. Since the dog owner lives in the third house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the root beer lover and the coffee drinker must be in adjacent houses, with the root beer lover to the left of the coffee drinker.

4. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the person who drives a minivan and the person who is wearing sandals must be in adjacent houses, with the minivan driver to the left of the person wearing sandals.

5. **Clue 2**: The dog owner lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - The dog owner lives in the third house (Clue 4), so the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

6. **Clue 12**: The person who likes white lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the golfer and the basketball player are adjacent, and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are adjacent, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

3. **Clue 3:** The soccer player lives in the third house.
   - This means the soccer player lives in house number 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in a house number less than the house number where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person with tulips does not live in house number 3.

From Clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in house number 3. Now, let's consider Clue 1 and Clue 2 together:

- Since the golfer and the basketball player are adjacent and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player, they must be in houses 1 and 2.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are also adjacent, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person with lilies must be in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person with lilies
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player

Now, we need to place the basketball player and the person who ate spaghetti. The basketball player must be in house 1 or 2, but since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the basketball player must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the person who ate spaghetti.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with lilies
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
12. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This is a contradiction because Clue 7 states the person who likes red lives in the third house. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's assume Clue 9 is correct and the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This means Clue 7 is incorrect, and the person who likes red does not live in the third house.

Now, let's re-evaluate the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: The pianist lives in the third house.
- Clue 4: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 5: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
- Clue 6: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
- Clue 8: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.

Let's assign the remaining houses:

- The third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.
- The fifth house is occupied by the person who likes red.

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- The first house is occupied by the person who likes blue.
- The second house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.
- The fifth house is occupied by the person who likes red.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person wearing running shoes lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the root beer lover lives in a house with a higher number than the person who is wearing sandals.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 1: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 2: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 4: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, 2, or 4, the only option left is house 1. So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 1.

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 4), the only option left for the person who only drinks water is house 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 2 for the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), the person who had stew must be in house 1, which is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater.

So, the only remaining option for the person who had stew is house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 4 for the person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 5). The person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew (Clue 5), and the only option left is house 4.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."

From Clue 3, the root beer lover does not live in the first house. From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. From Clue 2, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Sixth house: person who had stew (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the sixth house)
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who had stew
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above analysis, the person with the computer lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

1. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).

From Clue 1, we know that the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2, and the person who ate pizza must be in house 1. Since the person who ate pizza is the science fiction book fanatic, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house number step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in house 1.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the root beer lover lives in house 2, and the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white lives in house 1.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: The person who owns horses (dog owner) and the person who likes white.
- House 2: The root beer lover (person who drinks water).

Since the person who owns horses is the dog owner, the dog owner lives in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the percussionist lives.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

5. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

6. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

7. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{C}\)."

   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Likes green (since it's directly left of the person wearing running shoes)

6. **Clue 6:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.

   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

From Clue 7, we know that the person who owns horses lives in House 3 and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in House 2.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who owns horses (House 3) and the person who has daffodils (House 2) are next to each other, the person who likes green must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3. However, since the person who owns horses is already in House 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Likes white, Wearing sandals
- House 2: Has daffodils, Wearing running shoes
- House 3: Owns horses, Wearing boots

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the placement of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house (House 2).
3. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies

From Clue 1, the person who likes milk must be in House 3 because there is one house between House 1 and House 3. So, we have:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies
- House 3: Person who likes milk

From Clue 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (in House 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3. This leaves House 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who has a rose bouquet
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies
- House 3: Person who likes milk

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the cricketer lives.

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person wearing boots lives in either the first, third, or fourth house.

2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green must live to the left of the person who likes blue.

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy must live in adjacent houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means if the cricketer lives in house \(i\), the person who is wearing sandals must live in house \(i+1\).

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes yellow lives in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who has a phone lives in either the first, third, or fourth house.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the person who has a gameboy lives in a house after the house where the person who has a phone lives.

8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in house 3.

9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in house 1.

10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
    - This means if the person who has a phone lives in house \(i\), the person who has a radio lives in house \(i-1\).

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer lives in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Person who likes green, person who is wearing loafers, person who has a radio.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, person who has a phone.
- House 3: Person who likes yellow, person who has a gameboy.
- House 4: Person who likes white, person who is wearing sandals, person who has a television.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who likes green lives in house 1, the person who has a radio must live in house 2. Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in house 1, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 2 or 3. But since the person who likes blue lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 3.

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 3.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals must live in house 4, the cricketer must live in house 3.

However, we have a contradiction because the person who likes blue lives in house 3, and the person who has a gameboy also lives in house 3. This means we need to recheck the placement of the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy.

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 4. This means the cricketer must live in house 2.

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and the romance book lover must be to the left of the history book buff. Given that the yellow book lover is in House 1, the romance book lover must be in House 2, and the history book buff must be in House 3.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in House 1. Since the romance book lover is in House 2, the person who had pizza must be in House 3.

From Clue 5, the person who ate fried rice must live somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in House 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

### Clue 1: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
This means the tennis player and the person with the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be in a house to the left of the television.

### Clue 2: The golfer does not live in the second house.
This means the golfer cannot be in house number 2.

### Clue 3: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
This means the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses.

### Clue 4: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
This means the radio and rose bouquet must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the rose bouquet.

### Clue 5: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.
This means the radio and television must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on Clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

### Case 1: Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Television (V) in house 2

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

### Checking the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct house number for the person wearing sandals.

### Clues Recap:
1. The swimmer lives in the third house.
2. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

10. The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
12. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.

### Deductions:
- **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives in the third house.
  - House 3: Swimmer

- **Clue 2:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
  - This means the guitarist cannot live in house 5, and the carnations arrangement cannot live in house 1.

- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
  - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the tulips person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
  - This means if the running shoes person is in house X, the daffodils person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 5:** The violinist lives in the second house.
  - House 2: Violinist

- **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
  - This means if the basketball player is in house X, the guitarist is in house X+1.

- **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
  - This means if the high heels person is in house X, the lilies person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
  - This means if the loafers person is in house X, the percussionist is in house X+1.

- **Clue 9:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
  - House 4: Cricketer

- **Clue 10:** The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
  - This means they must be in houses X and X+1.

- **Clue 11:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
  - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

- **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
  - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the cellist must be in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

### Deduction Process:
1. **House 1:** Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
2. **House 2:** Violinist.
3. **House 3:** Swimmer.
4. **House 4:** Cricketer.
5. **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils.

Given Clue 11, the daffodils person is in house 5. Clue 12 tells us that the sandals person must be in house 1 or 3. Since the sandals person must be directly left of the tulips person, and house 3 is occupied by the swimmer, the sandals person must be in house 1.

### Final Check:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

The person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The fish enthusiast lives in house 1.
- The person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

Since the person in house 2 (house 2) ate grilled cheese, the person in house 1 (house 1) must be the fish enthusiast.

Since the fish enthusiast (house 1) cannot be the dog owner (as the dog owner must be in house 2), the dog owner must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who had stew lives is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and the information provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person based on the clues:

1. **Clue 13:** The person who owns horses lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Person who owns horses

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Romance book lover

3. **Clue 7:** The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fish enthusiast

4. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who has a vase of tulips lives and where the romance book lover lives.
   - Romance book lover is in house 5, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 or 6.
   - Since the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 6.
   - House 6: Person with the vase of tulips

5. **Clue 10:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - The bird keeper must be in a house to the right of the person with the bouquet of lilies.

6. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who owns horses is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1.
   - House 1: Person who likes white

7. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - The person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 6, so the person who likes yellow must be in house 1 or 2.
   - Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.
   - House 2: Person who likes yellow

8. **Clue 9:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in house 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1.
   - House 1: Person who likes yellow (yellow)
   - House 2: Person who likes daffodils

9. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - The fantasy book enthusiast must be in a house to the left of the person with the rose bouquet.

10. **Clue 6:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - The dog owner must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes red and the romance book lover live directly next to each other.
    - The romance book lover is in house 5, so the person who likes red must be in house 4.
    - House 4: Person who likes red

12. **Clue 12:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
    - The person who likes blue must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is already taken by the person who likes yellow.
    - Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 2.
    - House 2: Person who likes blue

13. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
    - Since the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who likes history must be in house 1.
    - House 1: Person who likes history

From the deductions, we have:
- House 1: Person who likes history
- House 2: Person who likes yellow
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Person who likes red
- House 5: Romance book lover
- House 6: Person with the vase of tulips

The only house left is house 4, which must be the house of the cat lover.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cat lover lives is **4**.

"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person eating oranges lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.

4. **Clue 4:** The flutist lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.

13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
14. **Clue 14:** The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
15. **Clue 15:** The science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives in the third house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

From Clue 4, the flutist lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the flutist.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. This contradicts Clue 2, so we need to re-evaluate. Since Clue 2 states the phone lives in the third house, and Clue 6 states the running shoes live in the third house, we need to consider the possibility that the phone and running shoes are different people.

From Clue 1, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Let's denote the person eating grapes as G and the person eating oranges as O. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From Clue 5, the person eating oranges (O) lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots (B). From Clue 3, the saxophonist (S) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots (B). This means B must be to the right of S.

From Clue 7, the romance book lover (R) lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF). This means R and SF must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels (HH) lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast (FB) lives. This means HH and FB must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 5 (but since we only have 4 houses, it must be 1 and 4).

From Clue 12, the history book buff (HB) lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges (O). This means HB must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 13, the person eating kiwis (K) does not live in the first house. So K must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 14, the percussionist (P) lives in the fourth house. So P is in house 4.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic (SF) and the person who is wearing running shoes (RS) live directly next to each other. Since RS lives in the third house, SF must live in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: HB (History book buff)
- House 2: SF (Science fiction book fanatic)
- House 3: RS (Running shoes)
- House 4: P (Percussionist)

Since the person eating oranges (O) must be to the right of the person wearing boots (B) and B must be to the right of S, and O must be to the right of B, the only possible positions for O and B are:
- O in house 4 (since P is in house 4)
- B in house 3 (since RS is in house 3)

This leaves the person eating grapes (G) and the person wearing boots (B) in houses 1 and 2. Since HB is in house 1, B must be in house 2, and G must be in house 1.

So, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know:
- The fourth house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
- The fourth house is also occupied by the saxophonist.

Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other, the violinist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house and the violinist is in the third house, the history book buff must be in the second house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 3, there is one house between the percussionist and the mystery book reader. Since the percussionist is in the third house and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, this clue is satisfied.

Thus, the positions are:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover (violinist)
- **House 3:** Saxophonist
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in each house:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Television

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers (already determined)
   - House 3: Phone (since the phone cannot be in house 2)

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - House 1: Boots
   - House 2: Loafers

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - House 1: Boots
   - House 2: Loafers
   - House 3: Phone
   - House 4: Television

From Clue 5, the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since house 2 is already occupied by loafers, the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Radio in house 1, Sandals in house 3**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 1: Radio
- House 3: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which contradicts Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

**Scenario 2: Radio in house 3, Sandals in house 1**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 3: Radio
- House 1: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which is consistent with Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

The person who has a gameboy lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the person wearing high heels lives:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
   - This directly tells us that the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Since the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and we already know the high heels person lives in house number 2, the coffee drinker must live in either house number 1 or house number 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes milk must live in either house number 2 or house number 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 2, as the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3.

Since the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3, the person who likes milk must be in house number 2 (because the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and the person who likes milk cannot be in house number 1).

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house number 2, and the coffee drinker must live in house number 1.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house (Clue 1), they must live in the second house.
- The mystery book reader cannot live in the second house (Clue 2), so the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

This leaves the history book buff to live in the second house, and the person wearing high heels to live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who had pizza lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (P) lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives directly left of the person who had stew (St).
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a television (Tv) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots (B) lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (P).
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) based on Clue 2 and Clue 9:

- Clue 2: The person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) must be adjacent.
- Clue 9: The person who is wearing boots (B) must be to the left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who had pizza and the person who is wearing sandals.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) must be adjacent.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots (B) must be to the left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's try different placements:

- If P is in house 1, then S must be in house 2 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 2, then B must be in house 1 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P. So, let's try another arrangement:

- If P is in house 2, then S must be in house 3 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 3, then B must be in house 2 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is also not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P.

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is possible. Let's check the other clues with this arrangement:

- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).
- **Clue 5:** The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives directly left of the person who had stew (St).
- **Clue 7:** The person who has a television (Tv) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).
- **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's place the remaining items:

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4.
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (Clue 9).
- If R is in house 2, then G must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If T is in house 1, then C must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If R is in house 2, then St must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- If Rb is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If Sp is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 10).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2, or the lilies are in house 1 and the rose bouquet is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2. This matches our deductions from Clue 3 and Clue 2.

Therefore, the person eating apples must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is (B) 2."

"Let's analyze the clues again to determine the house where the person who drives a truck lives.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

### Deductions:
- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.
- From Clue 2, the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
- From Clue 3, the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

Let's consider the possible placements:

1. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

2. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

3. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

4. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

5. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

### Conclusion:
The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the need to deduce the correct house for the person who likes milk, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **House 4: Lilies**
2. **House 5: Tulips**
3. **House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
4. **House 4: Rose Bouquet**
5. **House 5: Milk (next to the person who has a vase of lilies)**

From Clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house (House 4). From Clue 11, the science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house. From Clue 12, the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live next to each other. From Clue 13, the history book buff lives directly left of the percussionist. From Clue 14, the cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. From Clue 15, the pianist and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other. From Clue 9, the violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. From Clue 8, the violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. From Clue 7, the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader. From Clue 6, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist. From Clue 5, the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

Given that the person who has a rose bouquet (House 4) and the person who likes milk (House 5) live next to each other, and considering the constraints, the only logical placement for the person who likes milk is in House 5.

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in **House 5**.

The correct answer is (D) 5."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's reorganize the information step by step:

1. **First house**: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
2. **Fourth house**: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Third house**: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
4. **Second house**: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The correct option is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Green and Yellow**: The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who likes green.
   - Therefore, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

2. **Stew and Grilled Cheese**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

3. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

4. **Grilled Cheese**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

5. **Romance Book Lover**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the romance book lover lives in the second house, which is consistent with the previous information.

### Summary of Arrangement

- **First House**: Person who ate grilled cheese
- **Second House**: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- **Third House**: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

### Determining the Person Who Likes Blue

- The person who likes green lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

### Final Answer

The number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is **1**.

The correct option is (C) 1."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the bird keeper lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- First house: Carnations (person with carnations)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Second house: Vase of tulips and bird keeper
- Fourth house: Rose bouquet and person who likes blue (next to the person who owns horses)
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Second house: Percussionist or cellist
- Third house: Truck (next to the percussionist or cellist)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Given that the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist cannot both live in the first house, let's consider the possibility that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house and the cellist lives in the second house (number 2).

Now, let's use clue 3: the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the first house (number 1) is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the person who likes green must live in the second house (number 2), and the person who likes red must live in the first house (number 1).

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

From Clue 3, the history book buff lives in the first house. This confirms our arrangement:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, let's use Clue 1: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Now, the swimmer must live in the first or third house. But since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the swimmer must live in the first house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Thus, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2 because the sedan owner lives to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies, and house 1 is to the left of house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The flutist does not live in house 1, so the flutist must live in house 2.

Since the flutist lives in house 2, the person with the bouquet of lilies must also live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the romance book lover lives.

### Clues Recap:
1. There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the swimmer lives.
2. The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.
7. The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
8. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
9. There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives.

### Deductions:
1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Placing the People:
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player (since the tennis player does not live in the fourth house, this is a contradiction, so the tennis player must be in house 5).
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).
- House 1: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- House 6: Romance book lover (since the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\) from the mystery book reader, and the only available house is house 6).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.
- House 6: Romance book lover.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Coffee drinker lives in the third house.**

2. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the computer and gameboy cannot be in House 3. So, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

3. **The saxophonist does not live in the second house.**
   - Possible houses for saxophonist: 1, 3, 4, 5.

7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the computer is in House 5, the percussionist must be in House 4 (but cellist is in House 4). So, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3 and the percussionist in House 5.

9. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
   - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

13. **The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person with the rose bouquet lives.

1. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means if the minivan driver is in house 2, the person wearing boots must be in house 1.
   - If the minivan driver is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

2. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the person with pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the person with pizza must be in house 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, the person with pizza must be in house 3 (but this is not possible since the person with pizza must be to the right).

3. **The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person wearing running shoes must live in either house 2 or 3.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means if the person with tulips is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 1.
   - If the person with tulips is in house 3, the cricketer must be in house 2.

5. **The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with pizza must live in either house 1 or 3.

6. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means if the person with grilled cheese is in house 2, the person with sedan must be in house 1.
   - If the person with grilled cheese is in house 3, the person with sedan must be in house 2.

7. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person driving a minivan is in house 3.

8. **The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1.

9. **The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must live in either house 1 or 3.

Now, let's combine all the clues:

- From clue 7, the person driving a minivan is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the golfer is in house 1.
- From clue 5, the person who had pizza cannot be in house 2, so the person who had pizza must be in house 1 or 3. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.
- From clue 4, the cricketer must be in house 1 (since the person with tulips cannot be in house 1).
- From clue 3, the person wearing running shoes cannot be in house 1, so the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
- From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since the person with sedan must be in house 1).
- From clue 2, the person with pizza (in house 3) must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since the person with pizza is in house 3, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.
- From clue 1, the person wearing boots must be in house 2 (since the person driving a minivan is in house 3).

So, the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct option is (C) 1."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct house for each person.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
3. The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
6. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
8. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 7: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
- House 3: Fried Rice

#### Clue 8: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
- This means the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.

#### Clue 6: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
- This means if the person who had stew lives in house \(x\), the person who likes red lives in house \(x-1\).

#### Clue 2: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
- This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 2.

#### Clue 3: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
- This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 4.

#### Clue 1: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
- This means the person who likes green cannot be in house 2.

#### Clue 4: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- This means if the person who likes blue lives in house \(x\), the person who ate spaghetti must live in house \(x+1\).

#### Clue 5: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
- This means if the person who likes white lives in house \(x\), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house \(x+1\) or \(x+2\).

### Analyzing Clues:
- From Clue 7, Fried Rice is in house 3.
- From Clue 8, White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.
- From Clue 2, Stew cannot be in house 2 or 4.
- From Clue 3, Stew cannot be in house 4.
- From Clue 1, Green cannot be in house 2.
- From Clue 6, Red must be in house \(x-1\) if Stew is in house \(x\).

Let's try to place Stew and Red:
- If Stew is in house 1, Red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).
- If Stew is in house 1, Fried Rice is in house 3, and White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4 or 5.
- If Stew is in house 1, Fried Rice is in house 3, and White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4 or 5.
- If Stew is in house 1, Fried Rice is in house 3, and White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4 or 5.

Let's try placing White and Yellow:
- If White is in house 2, Yellow must be in house 4 (Clue 8).
- If White is in house 2, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (Clue 1).
- If White is in house 2, Yellow is in house 4, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 4 (Clue 6).

This configuration does not work because Yellow and White cannot be in houses 2 and 4 simultaneously.

Let's try another configuration:
- If White is in house 4, Yellow must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If White is in house 4, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (Clue 1).
- If White is in house 4, Yellow is in house 2, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 5 (Clue 6).

This configuration does not work because Red cannot be in house 5.

Finally, let's try:
- If White is in house 2, Yellow must be in house 4 (Clue 8).
- If White is in house 2, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (Clue 1).
- If White is in house 2, Yellow is in house 4, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 4 (Clue 6).

This configuration works:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: White
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's reanalyze the information step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 1**: The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house number 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2.

5. **Clue 3**: The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in house 2. From Clue 2, the person who likes red lives in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes yellow.

Now, we need to place the violinist and the basketball player in houses 1 and 4. From Clue 1, the violinist must be to the right of the basketball player. This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

Since the person who likes yellow is in house 1, the basketball player must be in house 4 (to be to the right of the tennis player, who must be in house 1).

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house number 4.

The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (B) 4."

   - Possible houses: 1, 2, 4

8. **Clue 16**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

### Combining Clues:

- From Clue 7, 15, and 16, the person who has a carnations arrangement can only live in houses 1 or 2.
- From Clue 1, 12, and 13, the root beer lover can only live in houses 1 or 2.

- From Clue 10, the coffee drinker can only live in houses 3 or 4.
- From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement can only live in houses 1 or 2.

### Final Deduction:

- If the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1, then the root beer lover must live in house 2 (Clue 12).
- The computer must live in house 2 (Clue 1).
- The bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1 (Clue 14).
- The coffee drinker must live in house 3 or 4 (Clue 10).
- The percussionist must live in house 4 or 5 (Clue 12).
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in house 3 or 4 (Clue 13).
- The person who has a phone must live in house 3 or 4 (Clue 11).
- The tea drinker must live in house 1 or 2 (Clue 16).

Given all these constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Coffee drinker
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies
- House 5: Percussionist

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (E) 1."

"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, we can determine the house where the person with a vase of tulips lives. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Dog owner in House 2 (Clue 3)**.
2. **Bouquet of daffodils in House 1 (Clue 4)**.
3. **Truck in House 4 (Clue 12)**.
4. **Convertible in House 5 (Clue 12)**.
5. **Vase of tulips in House 4 (Clue 10 and Clue 11)**.

By placing the dog owner in House 2, the bouquet of daffodils in House 1, the truck in House 4, and the convertible in House 5, we can deduce the remaining house for the vase of tulips, which must be House 4.

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the dog owner lives.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not adjacent.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the tea drinker and the cricketer are adjacent.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who only drinks water and the fish enthusiast are not adjacent.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the pizza eater and the dog owner are adjacent.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are not adjacent.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

Since the saxophonist lives in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the cat lover cannot live in house 1. Let's consider the possible positions for the fish enthusiast and the cat lover based on Clue 1.

### Possible positions for the fish enthusiast and the cat lover:
- If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the cat lover must be in house 3.
- If the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the cat lover must be in house 2.

### Case 1: Fish enthusiast in house 2, Cat lover in house 3
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Cat lover

Now, let's place the remaining people based on the other clues:
- The tea drinker must be in house 3 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The cricketer must be in house 2 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The person who only drinks water must be in house 1 (since the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast).
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).
- The dog owner must be in house 3 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).

This configuration works:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Cat lover (tea drinker, pizza eater)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (cricketer, dog owner)

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information and deduce the correct house for the person with the bouquet of lilies.

1. **History Book Buff in House 1:**
   - The person in house 1 has a history book and is wearing loafers.

2. **Cat Lover in House 2:**
   - The person in house 2 has a cat and is wearing high heels.

3. **Computer in House 2:**
   - The person in house 2 has a computer.

4. **Loafers in House 1:**
   - The person in house 1 is wearing loafers.

5. **High Heels and Daffodils:**
   - The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person wearing high heels is in house 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

6. **Computer and Loafers:**
   - The person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person with loafers.
   - Since the person with loafers is in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (loafers)
- House 2: Cat lover (high heels), computer

Since the person with a bouquet of lilies cannot be in house 1 (because the history book buff is there) and cannot be in house 2 (because the cat lover is there), the only remaining house is house 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

"Given the constraints and the logical analysis, let's break down the information:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house (Clue 1).
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist (Clue 2).

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover lives in house 1 (as per Clue 1), the pianist and the cellist must be in houses 1 and 2. Given that the pianist must be to the left of the cellist, the pianist must be in house 1 and the cellist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and place each person in their respective houses.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Person with carnations.

2. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Not tulips.

3. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - Houses 2 and 3: Daffodils and running shoes are adjacent.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - Houses 1 and 2: Running shoes and lilies are separated by one house.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Houses 3 and 4: Tulips are to the right of daffodils.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Not tulips.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Person with carnations.

8. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Not sandals.

9. **Clue 2**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.

    - Houses 4 and 5: Boots and carnations are adjacent.

11. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
    - Houses 2 and 3: Daffodils and running shoes are adjacent.

12. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
    - Houses 1 and 2: Running shoes and lilies are separated by one house.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 5: Person with carnations.
- House 4: Not tulips, not sandals, and not running shoes (since running shoes are adjacent to daffodils in house 2).
- House 3: Daffodils and running shoes are adjacent.
- House 2: Running shoes and lilies are separated by one house, and tulips are to the right of daffodils.
- House 1: Tulips and loafers are adjacent.

Given that house 4 is not occupied by tulips and house 5 is occupied by carnations, house 4 must be occupied by sandals (since sandals are not in the fifth house and not in the fourth house).

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- House 1: Tulips.
- House 2: Running shoes.
- House 3: Daffodils.
- House 4: Sandals.
- House 5: Carnations.

The person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house 2, as it is the only house left and it is adjacent to running shoes.

Thus, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the pianist lives.

  - Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

- **Swimmer and white cannot be in house 1 or 4.**
  - Possible pairs: (2, 3) or (3, 4).

- **One house between grapes and tennis player:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **Blue to the left of tea drinker:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

### Final Deduction

- If the white person is in house 2, then the tea drinker must be in house 3 (since they are one house apart).
- If the blue person is in house 1, then the oranges person must be in house 3 (since they are one house apart).

This leaves the following:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: White
- House 3: Tea drinker, Oranges
- House 4: Green, Pianist, Coffee drinker, or Percussionist

Since the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player, and the percussionist is to the left of the green person, the only possible positions for the saxophonist and the tennis player are:
- Saxophonist in house 1, Tennis player in house 2 (but this is already occupied by white).
- Saxophonist in house 2, Tennis player in house 3 (but this is already occupied by white).

Thus, the only possible positions are:
- Saxophonist in house 3, Tennis player in house 4.

This leaves the following:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: White
- House 3: Saxophonist, Tea drinker, Oranges
- House 4: Green, Pianist, Coffee drinker, or Percussionist

Since the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player, and the percussionist is to the left of the green person, the only possible positions are:
- Green in house 1, Pianist in house 2, Coffee drinker in house 3, Percussionist in house 4.

This leaves the pianist in house 2.

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. From Clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

From Clue 5, we know that the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW).
2. The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in the first house (house 1).

From Clue 2, we know:
- The SF lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.

This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses. Since the CD is in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1. This leaves the romance book lover to be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the logical analysis, we can deduce the following:

- The percussionist lives in House 1.
- The person with the radio lives in House 2.
- The pianist lives in House 2 (since the percussionist is in House 1 and they must be different).
- The person with the phone lives in House 1 (since the person with the radio is in House 2 and they must be different).

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

(A) 1"
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who likes yellow lives.

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the person who likes yellow and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, with the person who likes yellow in the house directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Given these clues, let's test the possible positions:

- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, then the person who likes yellow must be in house 2 (since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan).
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, then the person who likes yellow must be in house 2 (since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan).

However, if the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, then the person who likes white must be in house 3 (since there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan). This would mean the person who likes yellow must be in house 2, which contradicts the condition that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

Therefore, the only consistent solution is:
- The person who owns a sedan is in house 3.
- The person who likes yellow is in house 2.

Thus, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2 (the right house), so the person wearing sandals must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person eating grapes must also be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person eating grapes is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker cannot be in house 2).

From the above deductions:
- The person in house 1 is the tea drinker, eating grapes, and wearing sandals.
- The person in house 2 is the high heels wearer, the water drinker, and the person with the phone (since the person with the television must be in house 1).

Since the person eating kiwis must be in house 2 (as the only remaining option), the number of the house where the person who is eating kiwis lives is:

(A) 2"
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the guitarist lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot be in the third house, and the person who only drinks water cannot be in the first house.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house number 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - This means the violinist can only be in houses 2 or 3.

Given the tea drinker is in house 1, we can deduce the following:

- The cellist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 1).
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 4).
- The guitarist cannot be in house 3 (since the violinist cannot be there and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

So, the possible positions for the cellist and the guitarist are:
- Cellist in house 2 (since the cellist cannot be in house 3).
- Guitarist in house 3 (since the cellist is in house 2 and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

Let's verify this:
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The cellist is in house 2.
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), so the violinist must be in house 2 (but that's already taken by the cellist), so the violinist must be in house 3.
- The guitarist must be in house 3.

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who only drinks water lives.

   - This means the first house is occupied by someone other than the person wearing running shoes.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person who only drinks water cannot be in the fifth house (where the tea drinker lives), and the person who is wearing boots cannot be in the first house.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by someone who likes milk (and wearing sandals).

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: Someone who likes milk (and wearing sandals) (Clue 7)
- Third house: Someone wearing sandals (Clue 1)
- Fourth house: Someone who only drinks water (Clue 3)
- Fifth house: Someone who drinks tea (Clue 4)
- First house: Someone who is not wearing running shoes (Clue 2)
- Second house: Someone who is not the coffee drinker or the person who is wearing loafers (Clue 5)
- Fourth house: Someone who only drinks water (Clue 3)
- Fifth house: Someone who drinks tea (Clue 4)

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Person who is wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person who likes milk (and wearing sandals)
- Fourth house: Person who only drinks water
- Fifth house: Person who drinks tea

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The correct option is (B) 4."

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, we know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who had pizza.

From Clue 8, the person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house. Therefore, the computer must be in one of the other houses (1, 2, 3, or 5).

From Clue 6, the person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house. So, the radio must be in one of the other houses (1, 2, 3, or 5).

From Clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives. This means the grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives. This means the gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.

From Clue 2, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone. This means the television and phone must be in houses with the television to the left of the phone.

Let's place the pizza in the fourth house:
- House 4: Pizza

Now, let's place the computer and radio:
- The computer cannot be in house 4, so it must be in one of houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

Let's deduce the placement of the individuals:

- From Clue 1, the bird keeper and the grilled cheese eater must be in houses 1 and 2, respectively, with the grilled cheese eater in house 2 and the bird keeper in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the percussionist cannot be in house 2, so the percussionist must be in house 1.

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in houses 1 and 2. Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's analyze the placement of each person and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The bird keeper lives in the third house.
   - Bird keeper: House 3

2. **Clue 1**: The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Cat lover: House 1, 2, or 4

3. **Clue 3**: The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
   - Golfer and truck driver cannot be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
   - Convertible driver: House 2, 3, or 4

5. **Clue 5**: The baseball player does not live in the third house.
   - Baseball player: House 1, 2, or 4

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 5, as the convertible driver cannot be in the third house.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
   - Sedan owner: House 2, 3, or 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

8. **Clue 8**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - Soccer player: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the bird keeper)

9. **Clue 9**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.
   - Fish enthusiast: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the soccer player)

Let's place the bird keeper in house 3. Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- Convertible driver cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Baseball player cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so if the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 4. If the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 3 (but house 3 is taken by the bird keeper).

Given these constraints, let's try placing the convertible driver in house 1:
- Convertible driver: House 1
- Baseball player: House 2 (since they cannot be in house 3)
- Sedan owner: House 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper and house 4 for the sedan owner. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the sedan owner, house 2 for the fish enthusiast, and house 3 for the bird keeper.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."

3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 9 and Clue 10, we can infer that the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses, respectively, or vice versa. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the second house (Clue 3), the flutist must be in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or third house.

From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. This means the person eating a banana cannot be in the third house, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in the first house.

From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist cannot be in the third house, and the person eating oranges cannot be in the first house.

From Clue 8, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the person wearing running shoes cannot be in the third house, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers must be in the first or third house.

From Clue 4, the history book buff does not live in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in the first or third house.

From Clue 2, the percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in the first or third house.

Given the above constraints, let's try to place the people in the houses:

- If the flutist is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or third house.
- If the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house, the flutist cannot be in the first house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.
- If the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person eating a banana cannot be in the third house, and the person eating oranges cannot be in the first house.
- If the person eating a banana is in the first house, the person eating oranges must be in the second house, and the pianist cannot be in the second house.
- If the person eating oranges is in the second house, the pianist must be in the third house.

Thus, the only consistent arrangement is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Flutist
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast

Given this arrangement, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this clue is satisfied. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Kiwis

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the information step by step to determine the location of the person who had stew.

### Clue Breakdown

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means if the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
   - If the person eating oranges is in house 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 3 (but there is no house 3, so this is not possible).

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the cat lover.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

### Combining Clues

From Clue 1, we know the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, and from Clue 3, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must also be in adjacent houses.

Let's place the person eating stew in house 1 (since the person eating stew must be next to the mystery book reader, and the mystery book reader must be next to the cat lover).

If the person eating stew is in house 1, then the person who had stew must be in house 2 (since they are next to each other).

Now, the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes is in house 2.

The only remaining house is house 3, which must be for the cat lover and the person who ate fried rice. Since the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be adjacent, and the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are adjacent, the only way to fit all these clues is:

- House 1: Person eating stew
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes
- House 3: Cat lover and person eating fried rice

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person eating stew (in house 1) is next to the mystery book reader (in house 2).
- The mystery book reader (in house 2) is next to the cat lover (in house 3).
- The person wearing running shoes (in house 2) is next to the person eating stew (in house 1).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means if the daffodils are in house \(X\), the phone must be in house \(X+1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who has a television lives in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the person with the television is in house \(X\), the person with the vase of tulips must be in house \(X-1\).

### Deductions

- From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.
- This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2.
- From Clue 1, the person with the daffodils must live in house 1 (since the root beer lover lives in house 1 and the daffodils must be directly left of the phone, which is in house 2).

So, we have:
- House 1: Root beer lover (bouquet of tulips)
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Person who likes root beer (bouquet of tulips) (but this contradicts Clue 3, so this must be a different person)

Since the root beer lover is in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2, and the person with the daffodils must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes root beer.

### Conclusion

The person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

Thus, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

### Clue Breakdown

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Wearing loafers

   - Phone: House 1, 2
   - Mangos: House 2, 3

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - Grapes: House 1, 2
   - Water: House 2, 3

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - Boots: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Combining Clues

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by someone wearing loafers.

From Clue 2, the phone and mangos must be in different houses, and the phone must be to the left of the mangos.

From Clue 3, grapes and water must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 4, boots cannot be in the third house.

From Clue 5, kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 6, boots must be to the right of the gameboy.

From Clue 7, kiwis cannot be in the first house.

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone (must be left of mangos, so phone can be in 1 or 2, but not 3)
- **House 3:** Mangos (must be right of phone, so phone can be 1 or 2, but not 3)

Let's try different placements:

1. **Phone in House 1:**
   - Phone: House 1
   - Phone cannot be in House 3 (Clue 7)
   - Phone must be in House 2 (Clue 2)
   - Phone: House 2
   - Phone is left of mangos, so mangos must be in House 3

2. **Mangos in House 3:**
   - Mangos: House 3
   - Phone: House 2

3. **Grapes and Water in adjacent houses:**
   - Grapes: House 1, 2
   - Water: House 2, 3
   - Grapes must be in House 1 (since kiwis cannot be in House 1)

4. **Kiwis and Milk in adjacent houses:**
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3
   - Milk: House 2, 3
   - Kiwis must be in House 2 (since kiwis cannot be in House 1)

5. **Boots and Gameboy in adjacent houses:**
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3
   - Boots must be in House 2 (since kiwis are in House 2)

6. **Boots and Gameboy in different houses:**
   - Boots: House 2
   - Gameboy: House 1 or 3

Since boots are in House 2, gameboy must be in House 1 or 3.

### Final Arrangement

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a computer. The person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

9. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

### Analyzing the Clues:
Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the saxophonist:
- The saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, so he must be in the second or fourth house.
- The mystery book reader must be directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in the second house and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in the first or second house.

Given the saxophonist is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, the only possible positions for the percussionist are the third or fourth house. Let's check the third house:
- If the percussionist is in the third house, the guitarist must be in the second house, which is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house because the mystery book reader is there.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or second house, but the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the history book buff:
- The history book buff must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the flutist must be in the fourth house.

Finally, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

1. House 1: Green likes
2. House 2: Grilled cheese eater
3. House 3: ?
4. House 4: SUV owner
5. House 5: ?

Next, we place the person who is eating mangos based on Clue 12.

- The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV (Clue 12).
- The person who is eating mangos must live in the fifth house (House 5).

"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the saxophonist lives.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Radio

2. **Clue 8**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - This means the percussionist and the person who likes white must be in adjacent houses, with the percussionist in a lower-numbered house.

3. **Clue 9**: The person who likes red does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red cannot be in house 2.

   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 5.

10. **Clue 1**: The percussionist and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
    - This means the percussionist and guitarist must be in adjacent houses.

11. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives in the third house.
    - House 3: Green

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 3: Green
- House 3: Radio
- House 3: Computer (since the computer must be to the left of the phone, and the computer cannot be in house 2)
- House 3: Phone (since the computer is in house 3, the phone must be in house 4)
- House 3: Gameboy (since the phone is in house 4, the gameboy must be in house 3)
- House 3: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
- House 2: Red
- House 2: Percussionist (since the percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white, and the percussionist is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 3)
- House 3: White
- House 3: Saxophonist (since the saxophonist must be in the remaining house, which is house 1)
- House 1: Saxophonist
- House 1: Guitarist (since the guitarist lives directly next to the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1)
- House 1: Green (already confirmed)
- House 1: Cellist (since the cellist does not live in house 5, and the cellist cannot be in house 1, the cellist must be in house 4)
- House 4: Cellist
- House 4: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
- House 2: Red
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 2: White (already confirmed)
- House 2: Guitarist (already confirmed)
- House 2: Cellist (already confirmed)
- House 2: Television (already confirmed)
- House 5: Violinist (since the violinist lives two houses away from the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 5)
- House 5: Violinist

Thus, the saxophonist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

### Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
This means the cellist and the mystery book reader cannot be in houses 2 and 1, respectively. Therefore, the cellist must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

### Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
This means the history book buff and the cat lover cannot be in houses 2 and 1, respectively. Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

### Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2. However, this contradicts Clue 2, which states that the history book buff and the cat lover are in houses 1 and 2. Therefore, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but not in the order of Clue 2.

Given Clue 2, the only way to satisfy it is if the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2. This leaves the root beer lover and the guitarist in houses 1 and 2, but since they must be next to each other, they must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

### Summary of the arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses lives in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct house number for the person with the vase of tulips.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Analysis:
- **Clue 1** implies that if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.
- **Clue 2** states that the dog owner does not live in the second house, so the dog owner can only be in house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 3** indicates that the person with the vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Deduction:
- If the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in house 2 (since house 3 is ruled out by Clue 1). The carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1). The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- If the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper must be in house 1 (since house 2 is ruled out by Clue 1). The carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1). The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

Given these deductions, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the bird keeper lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating mangos.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This is because the banana eater cannot be in house 3, and the dog owner cannot be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses.

From Clue 5, the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2. Since the dog owner is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in adjacent houses. Since the person eating bananas is in house 1, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From Clue 4, the person who is eating a banana (in house 1) cannot be in house 3, so the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3.

Since the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 1 (mango eater), and the person eating kiwis must be next to the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in house 2 and the person eating kiwis must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, dog owner, bird keeper.
- House 3: Not banana, eating kiwis.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

The bird keeper lives in house 2.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2. The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

From Clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house (house number 1).

So, the arrangement of the houses and the people in them looks like this:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

From Clue 3, the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff and the bird keeper must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the only possible adjacent houses are houses 2 and 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Romance book lover or bird keeper

From Clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house (since the romance book lover cannot live in the third house, and the bird keeper must be in an adjacent house).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Since the bird keeper lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's analyze the placement of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the coffee drinker in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 1 or 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.
   - This means the kiwi eater lives in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the mangos eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 4.
- From Clue 6, the kiwi eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1, 2, or 4.
- From Clue 2, the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, and the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker.
- From Clue 5, the apple eater must be to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's try to place the people based on these constraints:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The soccer player lives in the third house (house 3).
2. **Clue 11:** The person who likes green lives in the fifth house (house 5).
3. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house (house 3).

From Clue 12, we know the person who is eating a banana lives in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues again to determine the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

"To determine the house where the percussionist lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Deductions

From Clue 6, the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. Let's denote the person who drives a minivan as \( M \) and the flutist as \( F \). Therefore, \( F \) must be in house 1 and \( M \) must be in house 2.

- If \( F \) is in house 1, then \( M \) is in house 2.
- If \( F \) is in house 2, then \( M \) is in house 3.

Let's consider both cases:

#### Case 1: Flutist in house 1, Minivan in house 2
- Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 3.
- Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. So, the gameboy must be in house 3.
- Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 2.
- Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 2, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 3. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 3.
- Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 3 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

So, in this case, the percussionist lives in house 1.

#### Case 2: Flutist in house 2, Minivan in house 3
- Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 1.
- Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. So, the gameboy must be in house 1.
- Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 3.
- Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 1, the person with the television must be in house 2 and the person with high heels must be in house 1.
- Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

This case contradicts Clue 5, as the minivan cannot be in house 3 if the truck is in house 1. Therefore, this case is invalid.

### Conclusion
The only valid configuration is the one where the flutist is in house 1, the minivan is in house 2, the cellist is in house 2, the gameboy is in house 3, the person with high heels is in house 3, the person with the television is in house 1, the person with boots is in house 3, and the percussionist is in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the constraints and the need to deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist.
2. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
4. **Clue 13**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a television.
5. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house.

8. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
9. **Clue 3**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
10. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
11. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
12. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
13. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).

From Clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 2, the pianist must be in house 3.

From Clue 13, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person who has a television lives in house 3.

From Clue 11, the violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a television is in house 3, the violinist and the person who is eating oranges must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3 and the person who is eating oranges must be in house 2.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating oranges (house 2) lives directly left of the saxophonist. Therefore, the saxophonist must be in house 1.

From Clue 1, the saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2, which contradicts the placement of the person who is eating oranges. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement of the person who is eating oranges and the saxophonist.

Since the person who is eating oranges must be in house 2 and the saxophonist must be in house 1, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 2, and the saxophonist must be in house 1. This means the person who is eating oranges is in house 2, and the saxophonist is in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. Since the violinist is in house 3, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 4 or 5. Since the person who is eating oranges is in house 2, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 4 or 5. Since the person who is eating oranges is in house 2, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 5.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must be in house 4.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the coffee drinker lives.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the SUV lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who drives a truck lives.

### Clue Analysis

1. **Blue and Spaghetti**: The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

5. **Red and First House**: The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Minivan and Daffodils**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction

#### Clue 5: Red does not live in the first house.
This means the person who likes red lives in either house 2 or house 3.

#### Clue 6: Minivan and Daffodils
This means the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So, if the minivan person is in house 1, the daffodils person must be in house 2, and vice versa.

#### Clue 4: Minivan and Stew
The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the minivan person must be in house 2, and the person who had stew must be in house 1.

#### Clue 3: Rose and Truck
The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means the truck person must be in house 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 2.

#### Clue 1: Blue and Spaghetti
The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

### Final Configuration
- House 1: Person who likes blue (rose bouquet)
- House 2: Person who has a rose bouquet (blue)
- House 3: Person who likes red (truck)

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who owns a sedan lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
6. **Clue 6:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
7. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes green does not live in the third house.

14. **Clue 14:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
15. **Clue 15:** The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.

From Clue 6, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. From Clue 8, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From Clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. From Clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first, third, or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From Clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From Clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. From Clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. From Clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

Now, let's summarize the known information:
- Second house: Flutist
- Third house: Cellist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV (and also the person who likes white)

Since the sedan owner cannot be in the second house (Clue 15) and the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must be in the first or third house. But the third house is already occupied by the cellist, so the sedan owner must be in the first house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct option is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's reorganize the information step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in House 1, and the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - This is already satisfied with the arrangement above.

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions from the clues, let's re-evaluate the placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper lives in the second house.
   - This directly tells us that the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the violinist cannot live in house number 1, and the bouquet of lilies cannot live in house number 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot live in house number 4, and the person who had pizza cannot live in house number 1.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - This means the violinist and the person with the rose bouquet must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

   - This means the dog owner must live in the house immediately to the right of the person with the vase of tulips.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
   - This means the saxophonist cannot live in house number 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house number 4.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot live in house number 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot live in house number 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house number 4, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house number 1.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person who owns horses lives in house number 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining people:

- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 10)
- House 4: Person who owns horses (Clue 9)

Since the bird keeper lives in house 2, we need to place the remaining people in houses 3 and 4.

From Clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 or 3. Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 3.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 4 (Clue 9).

From Clue 4, the violinist and the person with the rose bouquet must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the bouquet of lilies is in house 3, the violinist must be in house 2 (bird keeper), and the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 4 (person who had pizza).

From Clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 (guitarist), and the dog owner must be in house 2 (bird keeper).

From Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (violinist).

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1) must be to the left of the guitarist (house 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who owns horses

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information and assign the characteristics to the houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the saxophonist and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (house 1).
   - Therefore, the saxophonist is in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 4, we know the saxophonist is in house 1. From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2 (Clue 2).

Now, combining Clue 1 and Clue 3:
- The baseball player and the person eating grapes must be in houses 1 and 2.
- Since the saxophonist is in house 1 and the golfer is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

This leaves house 1 for the tea drinker and the person eating grapes. Since the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2, and the person eating grapes is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2. Since the golfer is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

Thus, the assignments are:
- House 1: Tea drinker, Romance book lover, Baseball player
- House 2: Person eating grapes, Golfer

The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2, as the person eating grapes is in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

13. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
14. The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
15. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
16. The science fiction book fanatic and the cellist live directly next to each other.

Given these constraints, let's start by placing the known elements:

- The person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.
- The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, so the person eating oranges lives in the third house.
- The person who is eating oranges and the person who is wearing loafers live directly next to each other, so the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, so the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff, and the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who likes blue. This means the person who likes green lives in the first house, and the person who likes blue lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff, so the person who likes green (in the first house) lives directly left of the person who likes blue (in the second house), and the person who likes blue lives in the second house.
- The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana, and the person who is eating bananas must be in the fifth house, so the person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
- The person who is eating oranges (in the third house) lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
- The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the person who likes yellow (in the first house) lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels (in the second house), so the saxophonist must be in the third house, and the percussionist must be in the fifth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, so the science fiction book fanatic and the cellist must be in the third and fourth houses, but since the fourth house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the science fiction book fanatic and the cellist must be in the third and fifth houses.

Now, the houses are:
1. Running shoes (first house)
2. Oranges (second house)
3. Apples (third house)
4. Fantasy book enthusiast (fourth house)
5. Saxophonist (fifth house)

The only house left is the second house, which must be occupied by the person who likes red.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 1**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots.

This leaves the second and third houses to be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels, and the person with the remaining flowers (roses) and the person wearing the remaining shoes (running shoes).

Since the first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots, the second house must be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels. This leaves the third house to be occupied by the person with the remaining flowers (roses) and the person wearing the remaining shoes (running shoes).

Therefore, the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and the need to deduce the correct arrangement, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The coffee drinker does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 2**: The root beer lover and the person wearing high heels are directly adjacent.
3. **Clue 3**: The basketball player and the tennis player are directly adjacent.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers are directly adjacent.
5. **Clue 5**: The tea drinker and the person who had pizza are directly adjacent.
6. **Clue 6**: The soccer player is to the right of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza is to the left of the cricketer.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who only drinks water is not in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who only drinks water is to the left of the tea drinker.
10. **Clue 10**: The person who only drinks water is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
11. **Clue 11**: The cricketer is to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
12. **Clue 12**: The root beer lover is to the left of the person who only drinks water.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.
14. **Clue 14**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing boots in the first house (House 1) as per Clue 13. This means the basketball player must be in House 2.

Now, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 3 (Clue 11).

The root beer lover and the person wearing high heels must be adjacent (Clue 2). Since the root beer lover is in House 1, the person wearing high heels must be in House 2. But we already have the basketball player in House 2, so the root beer lover must be in House 3 and the person wearing high heels must be in House 4.

The person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate spaghetti must be adjacent (Clue 4). Since the person wearing loafers is in House 4, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3.

The person who only drinks water must be to the left of the tea drinker (Clue 9) and to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 10). Since the person who only drinks water cannot be in House 5 (Clue 8), and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in House 5 (Clue 14), the person who only drinks water must be in House 1, the tea drinker in House 2, and the person who ate grilled cheese in House 5.

The cricketer must be to the right of the person who is wearing sandals (Clue 11), so the cricketer must be in House 4.

The person who had pizza must be to the left of the cricketer (Clue 7), so the person who had pizza must be in House 3.

The person who had stew must be to the left of the tennis player (Clue 14), so the person who had stew must be in House 1, and the tennis player must be in House 5.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Tea drinker, Person who is wearing high heels
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti, Person who is wearing loafers
- House 4: Person who is wearing boots, Basketball player
- House 5: Person who had pizza, Cricketer, Person who had stew, Tennis player

The tea drinker lives in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.

- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 6: Root beer lover

Now, let's place the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red (Clue 9).

- Since they live directly next to each other, they must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6.
- Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the yellow and red lovers must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6.

Let's place the yellow lover in house 5 and the red lover in house 4 (Clue 9).

- House 1: Tea drinker

- House 2: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Red lover
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover

- The grilled cheese eater lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

- House 2: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover
- House 8: Root beer lover

- House 5: Yellow lover
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover
- House 8: Root beer lover
- House 9: Root beer lover
- House 10: Root beer lover

Next, let's place the person who likes white and the person who likes green (Clue 10).

- The person who likes white lives one house to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other (Clue 9).

Let's place the person who likes white in house 2 (Clue 10).

- House 2: White lover
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover

Finally, let's place the person who likes green (Clue 13).

- The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who likes green.
- The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow (Clue 14).

Let's place the person who likes green in house 4 (Clue 13).

- House 4: Green lover

Clue 2 states that the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, then Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.
- If Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, then Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.

### Combining Clues

#### Case 1: Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes (Clue 1).
- If Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes, then Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow (Clue 3).
- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) wears boots (Clue 2).
- If Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, then Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader (Clue 2).

This creates a contradiction because Person 1 (House 1) cannot be the mystery book reader and like yellow simultaneously. Therefore, this case is invalid.

#### Case 2: Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes (Clue 1).
- If Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes, then Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow (Clue 3).
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) wears boots (Clue 2).
- If Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, then Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader (Clue 2).

This is consistent with all clues. Therefore, we can deduce:
- Person 1 (House 1) likes red.
- Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow.
- Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.
- Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

Since the only remaining characteristic is the fantasy book enthusiast, and Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader, Person 1 (House 1) must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

   - House 2: White
   - House 3: Romance book lover

3. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.

   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people and their characteristics as follows:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. **Clue 2:** The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The violinist lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the violinist lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: ?

From Clue 3, the violinist lives in the second house, so the violinist is in House 2.

From Clue 1, the cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in House 3, because the cellist would then be in House 3, which would make the cellist to the left of the cricketer. Therefore, the cricketer must be in House 1, and the cellist must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the basketball player is in House 2. This leaves the soccer player to live in House 1 or House 3. But we already know the cricketer lives in House 1 and the cellist lives in House 3.

Therefore, the soccer player must live in House 1.

The number of the house where the soccer player lives is **(A) 1**."

   - If the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 4, the history book buff must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
    - This is a contradiction with Clue 2. Since the fourth house is already occupied by the mystery book reader, this clue is not valid. We need to re-evaluate the clues.

- House 4: Mystery book reader (from Clue 2)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (from Clue 10)

- First house: Tennis player (clue 4)

Let's summarize the information we have:
- First house: Person eating oranges
- Fourth house: Person eating a banana

- The person in house 2 must have a gameboy (since the computer is in house 1).
- The person in house 2 must be the guitarist (since the violinist is in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2).

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the bird keeper lives is (B) 2."
"Let's deduce the house where the person who has a computer lives based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house (house 2).
2. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in a house number greater than house 2.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person wearing boots lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Boots

2. The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person wearing high heels must live in house 1.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots

3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Sedan

4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person who owns an SUV must live in house 1.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Sedan

5. The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Sedan

From the above deductions, we know:
- House 1: High Heels
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Sedan

Since the person wearing high heels lives in house 1, and the cat lover lives in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be the cat lover. This leaves the person wearing running shoes to live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who is eating apples lives.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 2, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the tea drinker lives in House 3, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in Houses 1 and 2.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in House 1, and the person who is wearing boots lives in House 2.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who is eating oranges must live in either House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 already has the person with carnations, the person who is eating oranges must live in House 2.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Person who likes green
- House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other, and the only remaining house for the person who likes milk is House 3, the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the people and their devices step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB).
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P).
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV).

From Clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as Mystery Reader (MR), History Book Buff (HBB), and Science Fiction Fanatic (SFF).

From Clue 1, the mystery book reader (MR) must be in the first house, and the history book buff (HBB) must be in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the history book buff (HBB), which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Since the mystery book reader (MR) is in the first house, the history book buff (HBB) must be in the third house. This means the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: ?
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the person who has a computer (C). So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: TV
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 3, the person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P). Since the person with the computer is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. This means the person with the phone is the mystery book reader (MR). This is consistent with Clue 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB (history book buff)

The person who has a phone is the mystery book reader (MR), and the person who has a computer is in the second house. The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic (SFF), who must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

From the perspective of a logic grid puzzle expert, it is not logically impossible for pigs to use pig Latin. While pigs do not have the cognitive ability to understand or produce human languages, they can be trained to perform certain tasks and respond to commands. The concept of pig Latin, as a playful transformation of words, is a human linguistic construct. Therefore, pigs, being non-human entities, cannot inherently use or understand pig Latin, but they can be trained to perform actions that might be interpreted as mimicking certain aspects of language use."

"To determine if the 1936 Summer Olympics venue was too small for a Superbowl crowd, we need to compare the capacities of the two venues.

1. **1936 Summer Olympics Venue:**
   - The Berlin Olympic Stadium (now Olympiastadion) had a capacity of approximately 110,000 spectators.

2. **Superbowl Crowd:**
   - The Super Bowl typically attracts a crowd of over 70,000 people, with the highest recorded crowd being over 100,000.

Given these capacities:
- The 1936 Summer Olympics venue could accommodate 110,000 spectators.
- The Superbowl crowd can exceed 100,000 spectators.

Therefore, the 1936 Summer Olympics venue would be too small for a Superbowl crowd.

(B) Yes"
"Given the constraints, I will provide a logical deduction based on the known distribution of brown rockfish and the location of Saint Kitts and Nevis.

Brown rockfish (Sebastes norvegicus) are typically found in colder waters of the North Atlantic, such as the Gulf of Maine and the northeastern United States. Saint Kitts and Nevis are islands in the Caribbean Sea, which are not known for supporting brown rockfish populations.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) No"

Growing seedless cucumber might not be ideal for a gardener with entomophobia. Seedless cucumbers often rely on pollination by insects, which could trigger anxiety or fear in someone with entomophobia. Therefore, it might be more comfortable for a gardener with entomophobia to focus on growing regular cucumbers, which do not require pollination and thus do not involve insects. 

The correct answer is:
(B) No"
"To determine if Martin Luther would run out of theses in half a year if he wrote one per day, we need to consider the number of days in half a year.

Half a year is equivalent to 182.5 days. If Martin Luther wrote one thesis per day, he would have written 182 theses in 182 days. On the 183rd day, he would have written his 183rd thesis.

Therefore, Martin Luther would not run out of theses in half a year. He would have 183 theses by the end of 182.5 days.

The correct answer is:

(B) No"
"Given the context, the question seems to be comparing two activities: ""waltz"" and ""slam dance."" Waltz is a traditional dance form known for its slow, graceful movements, which generally have low impact and are less likely to cause injury. On the other hand, ""slam dance"" is not a standard term in dance terminology and could refer to various types of dance styles, some of which might be more energetic and potentially more injurious.

Without a clear definition of ""slam dance,"" it's difficult to definitively state whether it is less injurious than waltz. However, based on the typical understanding of the term ""waltz,"" it is generally considered less injurious than more energetic dance styles.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"

"Given the constraints and the persona of an expert in logic grid puzzles, the difficulty of snowboarding on Venus can be analyzed through the lens of environmental conditions and the feasibility of snow formation and snowboarding.

1. **Temperature**: Venus has a surface temperature of approximately 462°C (864°F), which is far above the melting point of ice and snow. This makes snow formation impossible.
2. **Atmospheric Pressure**: The atmospheric pressure on Venus is about 92 times that of Earth's at sea level, which would compress and melt any snow that might form.
3. **Atmospheric Composition**: Venus's atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. This environment is not conducive to snow formation and would be highly corrosive to any materials used in snowboarding.

Considering these factors, it would be **extremely difficult** to snowboard on Venus.

**Correct option: (B)**"
"To determine if Charlemagne's father, Pepin the Short, was instrumental in the outcome of the Battle of Tours, we need to consider the historical context and the roles of both Pepin the Short and Charles Martel.

1. **Pepin the Short**: He was the father of Charlemagne and played a significant role in the Frankish Kingdom. He was instrumental in the coronation of Charlemagne as king and supported the papacy. However, he lived from 682 to 768, which is several decades before the Battle of Tours in 732.

2. **Charles Martel**: He was the military leader who led the Frankish forces at the Battle of Tours. Charles Martel was instrumental in the outcome of the battle, as his forces defeated the Muslim forces, effectively halting the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate into Europe.

Given this information, Pepin the Short was not directly involved in the Battle of Tours. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"

Ariana Grande could be a relevant topic in a presentation about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to her public disclosure of her experiences with PTSD. As an expert in logic grid puzzles, I can infer that Ariana Grande's story can serve as a real-world example to illustrate the symptoms, triggers, and coping mechanisms associated with PTSD. Her openness about her struggles and the steps she took to manage and overcome PTSD can provide valuable insights and inspiration for those dealing with similar conditions."

"To avoid internet trolls on Reddit, you can take several logical steps based on the principles of managing disruptive behavior in online communities. Here are some strategies:

1. **Ignore and Report**: Trolls often seek attention, so ignoring their posts and reporting them to Reddit can help reduce their visibility and impact. This approach leverages the principle of diminishing returns, where continued engagement can escalate the situation.

2. **Use Filters and Subreddit Settings**: Some subreddits have filters or settings that can help reduce the number of troll posts you see. This is akin to implementing a filter in a logic grid puzzle to eliminate irrelevant information, thereby focusing on the core issues.

3. **Stay Alert and Vigilant**: Be aware of the signs of troll behavior and be prepared to take action if necessary. This involves maintaining a high level of awareness, which is crucial in any logical reasoning scenario.

4. **Engage with Respect**: Sometimes, engaging with trolls in a respectful manner can help defuse the situation. However, this approach should be used cautiously, as it can sometimes escalate the situation. This is similar to the principle of handling contradictions in a logical argument, where a balanced approach is necessary.

5. **Use Moderators**: If a troll is causing significant disruption, you can flag the post or the user to the subreddit's moderators, who can take action. This is akin to seeking expert advice in a logic grid puzzle, where a moderator (or a higher authority) can provide a definitive solution.

By employing these strategies, you can minimize the impact of trolls on your Reddit experience. Therefore, the correct answer to the question ""Can you avoid internet trolls on Reddit?"" is:

Given the size and weight of a bengal fox, it is physically impossible for Ryan Crouser to throw one with ease. Furthermore, it is not ethical or legal to attempt to throw a wild animal."
"To determine if Lord Voldemort would have been barred from Hogwarts under his own rules, we need to consider the nature of his rule and the potential rules he might have set.

1. **Lord Voldemort's Rule**: Voldemort is known for his strict and often harsh rule, which aimed to maintain his power and control over the school.

2. **Potential Rules**: Voldemort could have implemented rules such as:
   - All students must speak in English.
   - Students must wear a uniform.
   - Any form of rebellion or non-compliance would result in severe punishment.

3. **Self-Appointed Rules**: If Voldemort were to be the one setting the rules, he could have made any rule he wanted. Given his tyrannical nature, it is plausible that he could have included a rule that he himself would be barred from Hogwarts.

Given this reasoning, if Voldemort were to be the one setting the rules, he could have made a rule that he himself would be barred from Hogwarts.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Therefore, having lactic acid in the body is not bad; it is a normal part of the body's response to increased energy demands during exercise."
"The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed attempt to assassinate King James I of England and the English nobility. Mary, Queen of Scots, was a Catholic and had been imprisoned in England since 1568. She was accused of involvement in the Gunpowder Plot and was executed in 1587 by King James I. Therefore, the Gunpowder Plot did not eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline. 

The correct answer is:
(A) No"
"To determine if Alice from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" could join a Masonic Lodge, we need to consider the nature of both entities:

1. **Alice**: Alice is a fictional character created by Lewis Carroll. Fictional characters do not have the ability to join real-world organizations, as they do not exist in the physical world.

2. **Masonic Lodge**: Masonic Lodges are real organizations with specific membership criteria and requirements. These criteria typically include being a male adult, having a certain level of education, and being of good moral character.

Given these points, Alice, being a fictional character, cannot fulfill the criteria required to join a Masonic Lodge. Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"To determine whether a bull shark bite hurts worse than a crocodile bite, we need to consider the characteristics and behaviors of both animals.

1. **Bull Shark Characteristics:**
   - Bull sharks are known for their aggressive behavior and are capable of biting humans.
   - They are found in various coastal and river environments.
   - Bull sharks have powerful jaws and can deliver significant force in their bites.

2. **Crocodile Characteristics:**
   - Crocodiles are generally more selective about their prey but can attack humans if provoked.
   - Crocodiles have powerful jaws and can deliver significant force in their bites.
   - The severity of the bite can vary depending on the species and the size of the crocodile.

Given these characteristics, both bull shark bites and crocodile bites can cause severe pain and injury. The severity of the injury would depend on the specific circumstances, such as the size of the animal, the force of the bite, and the individual's response to the injury.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"

In the context of logic grid puzzles, which often involve scenarios of consent and agency, Snow White's situation does not align with the principles of good consent. The parents and stepmother in the fairy tale do not provide Snow White with the opportunity to give her own consent to leave the castle. Instead, they force her to do so, which is not a scenario of mutual agreement or informed consent. Therefore, Snow White's situation does not exemplify good consent."
"(B) No

Avengers Comics would not be out of place in a DC Comics store. Both Marvel and DC Comics are part of the larger comic book industry and often feature crossover events and shared universe stories. Characters from one company can appear in the other's comics, making Avengers Comics a suitable addition to a DC Comics store, especially if it's part of a crossover event or shared universe storyline."

"Given the context of Somalia and the specific question about a celibate cleric suffering a stoning, we need to consider the legal and cultural landscape. As an expert in logic grid puzzles, I will approach this problem methodically.

1. **Legal Framework**: Somalia has a legal system that is based on a mix of Islamic law (Sharia) and customary law. However, there are no specific laws that mandate stoning as a punishment for any crime or offense.
2. **Cultural Practices**: While there are cultural practices and interpretations of religious texts that can lead to stoning in some communities, these practices are not uniformly applied across the country. Rural areas may have stricter interpretations, but urban areas and more progressive communities are less likely to enforce such practices.
3. **Cleric Status**: The status of a cleric does not exempt them from the laws and cultural practices of their country. If a cleric were to engage in an act that is considered a crime by the local laws or cultural norms, they could face legal consequences, but stoning is not one of them.

Based on this analysis, the likelihood of a celibate cleric suffering a stoning in Somalia is very low.

The correct answer is:

Spaghetti should not be slick when cooked. In the context of logic grid puzzles, which often involve precise categorization and adherence to specific criteria, the al dente texture is crucial for spaghetti. This texture ensures that the spaghetti is firm and has a slight resistance when chewed, indicating that it has been cooked to the right level without becoming mushy or overcooked. A slick spaghetti strand would typically indicate that it has been overcooked, losing its characteristic texture and potentially becoming too soft."

Issac Newton is not often associated with a red fruit. While there is a popular myth suggesting that Newton was struck on the head by an apple, this event is not historically verified. The red fruit commonly associated with Newton is the apple, but this connection is more of a folk tale than a factual association."
"Given the context of being an expert in logic grid puzzles, it is important to consider the properties of a jackfruit and the potential risks associated with its impact on the head.

Jackfruit, being a large and heavy fruit, can indeed pose a risk if thrown at someone's head. The force and size of a thrown jackfruit could potentially cause injury, including bruising, swelling, or even more serious injuries. Therefore, it is not safe to have a jackfruit thrown at your head.

The correct answer is:
(A) No"
"Given the constraints and the persona of an expert in logic grid puzzles, let's approach this question logically:

Christopher Reeve's survival and recovery were influenced by a combination of factors, including access to advanced medical care, his own determination, and the support of his community. If he were poor, he would likely face significant challenges in accessing the necessary medical care and support systems. However, the question asks if he would have lived, and the answer is not definitively yes or no due to the complexity of the situation.

In a logical grid puzzle context, we would consider the following:

1. **Access to Medical Care**: Wealth can provide better access to medical facilities and treatments.
2. **Quality of Life**: Wealth can improve the quality of life through access to home health care and support services.
3. **Research and Development**: Wealth can fund research and development, potentially leading to new treatments and technologies.

Given these points, poverty would likely make it more difficult for Christopher Reeve to access the necessary care and support, which could have a negative impact on his survival and recovery. However, it is not a definitive answer that he would not have lived.

Therefore, the most logical response, considering the constraints and the domain expertise, is:

(A) No"

"To determine if binary numbers and the standard alphabet can satisfy the criteria for a strong password, we need to consider the typical requirements for a strong password:

1. Length: A strong password should be at least 8 characters long.
2. Character variety: A strong password should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Given that:
- Binary numbers consist only of 0s and 1s.
- The standard alphabet consists only of letters (both uppercase and lowercase).

Let's analyze:
- **Length**: A password consisting solely of binary numbers or letters from the standard alphabet cannot meet the minimum length requirement of 8 characters.
- **Character variety**: A password consisting only of binary numbers or letters from the standard alphabet cannot include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Therefore, a password that is solely based on binary numbers and the standard alphabet does not meet the criteria for a strong password.

The correct answer is:

"Given the context of a logic grid puzzle expert, let's consider the properties of white rice and sesame seeds in a logical manner:

1. **White Rice**: While white rice can lose its freshness and become stale over time, it does not typically go rancid. The primary components of rice are carbohydrates, and it does not contain significant amounts of fats or oils that can go rancid.

2. **Sesame Seeds**: Sesame seeds contain oils that can oxidize and go rancid over time, especially if they are exposed to air, light, or heat. This process is more likely to occur before the white rice becomes stale.

Based on this reasoning, white rice is less likely to go rancid before sesame seeds.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To determine if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to consider the storage requirements for a single hour of Netflix content.

1. **Netflix Content Size**: Netflix typically streams content at a resolution of 1080p, which is a high-quality format. The size of a 1080p video file can vary, but generally, a single hour of high-quality video can range from 1.5GB to 3GB.

2. **Storage Requirement for 10 Hours**: If we take the average size of a 1080p video file as 2.5GB (which is a reasonable estimate), then 10 hours of video would require:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 2.5 \text{ GB/hour} = 25 \text{ GB}
   \]

3. **Comparison with USB Capacity**: A 500GB USB device has a storage capacity of 500GB.

Since 25GB is significantly less than the 500GB capacity of the USB device, a 500GB USB device is more than enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day.

Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine if Jon Brower Minnoch could break a chair before the Voyager 2 launch mass, we need to consider the following:

1. **Voyager 2 Launch Mass**: The Voyager 2 spacecraft had a launch mass of approximately 795 kilograms (1,753 pounds).
2. **Jon Brower Minnoch's Mass**: At the time of his death in 1983, Jon Brower Minnoch weighed only about 10 pounds, which is approximately 0.045 kilograms.

Given that the mass of the Voyager 2 spacecraft is significantly greater than the combined mass of a chair and a human, and considering that Jon Brower Minnoch was extremely underweight, it is highly improbable that he could break a chair, let alone a spacecraft.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"Given the perspective of an expert in logic grid puzzles, we can approach this question by considering the general behavior of hedgehogs and the characteristics of animals without a spinal cord.

Hedgehogs are known for their curiosity and are not typically deterred by the presence of a spinal cord. They are more likely to investigate and interact with various creatures, including those without a spinal cord, such as jellyfish, starfish, and sponges. These invertebrates do not have the same sensory capabilities or awareness as vertebrates, but hedgehogs are not specifically programmed to avoid them.

Therefore, a hedgehog would not avoid animals without a spinal cord.

"To determine if United Airlines was blameless in the worst crash in history, we need to consider the context and the specific details of the incident. The worst crash in history, often referred to as the ""Miracle on the Hudson,"" involved United Airlines Flight 1549, which was successfully landed after both engines were lost due to a flock of geese. This incident is considered a significant aviation success story rather than a disaster.

Given this context, United Airlines was not directly responsible for the crash. However, the company faced significant criticism and scrutiny for its response to the crisis. The decision to land the aircraft at a smaller airport rather than the nearest one, which was 100 miles away, was criticized for being rushed and without proper consultation with the pilots. This decision contributed to the severity of the situation and the subsequent crash.

Therefore, while United Airlines was not directly responsible for the crash, it was not blameless in the aftermath and the broader context of the incident. United Airlines faced significant criticism for its handling of the situation.

The correct answer is:

Therefore, it cannot be considered a symbol of the French Revolution."
"Given the context of a logic grid puzzle expert, we need to consider the anatomical protection of the largest and smallest bones in the torso.

The largest bone in the torso is the sternum (breastbone), which is protected by the rib cage. The rib cage provides a significant amount of protection from external blows.

The smallest bone in the body is the stapes, which is located in the middle ear. This bone is protected by the temporal bone of the skull, which forms part of the outer and middle ear. This bone structure effectively shields the stapes from external impacts.

Considering these anatomical protections, the torso is generally safe from blows to the sternum and the stapes.

"To address the question of whether raw carrots are better for maximizing vitamin A intake, we need to consider the bioavailability of vitamin A in both raw and cooked carrots.

1. **Raw Carrots**: The vitamin A in raw carrots is primarily in the form of beta-carotene, which the body can convert into vitamin A. However, the conversion process is not 100% efficient, and the body may not absorb all the beta-carotene.

2. **Cooked Carrots**: Cooking carrots can help release more of the beta-carotene, making it more accessible to the body. This increased bioavailability means that more vitamin A can be absorbed from cooked carrots compared to raw carrots.

Given these points, cooked carrots are generally better for maximizing vitamin A intake because they enhance the body's ability to absorb the vitamin. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"

"To determine whether the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space than the Library of Congress, we need to consider the scale and scope of each library.

The Library of Alexandria, which existed from the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD, was one of the largest libraries in ancient times. It is estimated to have contained tens of thousands of scrolls, but the exact number and the physical space they occupied are not definitively known. The library was primarily focused on preserving and studying ancient texts, including works from various civilizations.

In contrast, the Library of Congress, established in 1800, is the largest library in the world. It is located in Washington, D.C., and houses over 170 million items, including books, manuscripts, and other materials. The physical space required to house these items is substantial, with the library occupying a large area in the United States.

Given the vast difference in the number of items and the size of the collections, it is highly unlikely that the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space than the Library of Congress. The Library of Alexandria, while impressive, was much smaller in scale and scope compared to the Library of Congress.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Given the persona of an expert in logic grid puzzles, it is important to consider the nature of the Clerk of the Supreme Court of Canada's role and how it might relate to seismophobia. The Clerk's responsibilities include managing the court's administrative functions, overseeing the court's operations, and ensuring the smooth functioning of the court. These duties are primarily administrative and legal, and do not involve direct exposure to seismic activity.

Seismophobia, being a specific phobia related to earthquakes, would not be directly impacted by the Clerk's job responsibilities. However, the fear of earthquakes could potentially cause stress or anxiety in a professional setting, especially if there are natural disasters or seismic events occurring in the region. The Clerk would need to manage their anxiety and ensure they can perform their duties effectively.

Therefore, while the Clerk's job does not inherently pose a risk of harm due to seismophobia, the phobia itself would still be a personal challenge that the individual would need to manage.

"To determine if a nickel can fit inside a koala pouch, we need to compare the dimensions of a nickel and the koala pouch.

A nickel is approximately:
- Diameter: 21.21 mm
- Thickness: 1.75 mm

A koala pouch is approximately:
- Diameter: 10 cm (which is 100 mm)
- Depth: 10 cm (which is 100 mm)

Given these dimensions:
- The diameter of the koala pouch is 100 mm, which is significantly larger than the diameter of the nickel (21.21 mm).
- The depth of the koala pouch is also 100 mm, which is larger than the thickness of the nickel (1.75 mm).

Since the diameter of the koala pouch is much larger than the diameter of the nickel, and the depth of the pouch is also larger than the thickness of the nickel, a nickel would not fit inside a koala pouch.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) No"

"To address whether too many oranges can cause diarrhea, we need to consider the digestive capacity and the potential effects of consuming a large number of oranges.

Oranges are rich in vitamin C, fiber, and natural sugars. While these components are generally beneficial, they can be overwhelming for the digestive system if consumed in excess. The high fiber content can lead to increased bowel movements and gas, which might cause discomfort. The natural sugars can also lead to rapid changes in blood sugar levels, potentially causing digestive issues in some individuals.

However, the likelihood of causing diarrhea, which is a more severe digestive issue, is relatively low unless the consumption is extremely high and the digestive system is not accustomed to such a high intake of citrus fruits. For most people, occasional consumption of oranges is unlikely to cause diarrhea.

Given this reasoning, the correct answer is:

"To determine if any of Pope Alexander VI's descendants were canonized, we need to consider the criteria for canonization in the Catholic Church and the historical context of the Borgia family.

1. **Criteria for Canonization**: The Catholic Church requires that a candidate for canonization must be proven to have lived a life of heroic virtue, have been declared beatified, and have been martyred or died in the state of grace. Additionally, there must be sufficient evidence of miracles attributed to the intercession of the candidate.

2. **Historical Context of the Borgia Family**: Pope Alexander VI, Rodrigo Borgia, was indeed known for his lavish lifestyle and the numerous illegitimate children he fathered. His descendants, including Cesare Borgia, were known for their political and military prowess but were also involved in significant controversies and scandals.

3. **Canonization of Borgia Family Members**: While some members of the Borgia family were prominent figures, none of them met the stringent criteria for canonization. Cesare Borgia, for example, was involved in several political and military conflicts and was eventually executed. His sister Lucrezia Borgia was known for her political acumen but also for her involvement in various scandals. There is no evidence of miracles attributed to any member of the Borgia family that would have led to their canonization.

"To determine whether a sofer would be a bad job for a vegan, we need to consider the materials and practices involved in the sofer's work.

A sofer writes or inspects the writing of Torah scrolls, which are central to Jewish religious practice. The materials used in Torah scrolls can include parchment made from animal skin and ink that might contain gelatin. Parchment is the skin of an animal that has been processed, and gelatin is a protein derived from animal bones and skin.

For a vegan, the use of these materials would be problematic because they involve the consumption or handling of animal products. However, it is possible for a sofer to work with vegan-friendly materials and practices, such as using synthetic parchment and non-animal-derived inks.

Given this information, a sofer would not necessarily be a bad job for a vegan if they use only vegan-friendly materials and practices. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"

"To determine whether it is more expensive to run for President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11, we need to consider the costs involved in each scenario:

1. **Cost of Running for President of India:**
   - The cost can vary widely depending on the candidate's resources, campaign strategy, and the political landscape. However, for a rough estimate, let's consider a range. In India, the cost can be substantial, often ranging from a few million to tens of millions of Indian Rupees (INR) or more.

"Given the context of a logic grid puzzle expert, the question about the status of Japanese serfdom compared to English serfdom is more about historical and social structures rather than a direct comparison of status. However, to address the question logically:

In the context of feudal systems, English serfdom was characterized by a form of personal servitude where peasants were bound to the land and required to perform labor for their lords. The status of serfs was generally lower than that of the nobility but higher than that of free peasants.

Japanese feudalism, on the other hand, was more about the relationship between the samurai class and the daimyo (feudal lords). While there was a form of dependency, it was not as strictly defined as serfdom in England. The samurai were warriors who received land grants and protection in exchange for military service, which was different from the personal servitude of serfs.

Therefore, the status of Japanese serfdom was not higher than that of English serfdom. The correct answer is:

(A) No"

"To determine whether it would be very difficult for Nuno Gomes to dive to the Red Sea's deepest point, we need to consider the depth and the technical requirements for such a dive.

1. **Depth of the Red Sea's Deepest Point:**
   The Red Sea's deepest point, the Suez Trough, is approximately 4,267 meters (14,000 feet) below sea level.

2. **Technical Requirements for Diving to Such Depths:**
   Diving to such depths requires specialized equipment, including a pressurized diving suit or a submersible vehicle, as well as extensive training and experience. The pressure at 4,267 meters is extremely high, which makes it challenging and dangerous for a human to dive to such depths without the proper equipment and training.

A paraplegic is not suitable for conducting an orchestra due to the physical requirements of playing most instruments. Conducting an orchestra involves precise hand movements, finger dexterity, and the ability to communicate complex musical instructions to a large ensemble. These tasks are beyond the capabilities of a paraplegic, who lacks the motor function in the lower body necessary to play most musical instruments. However, a paraplegic can still contribute to an orchestra in other capacities, such as through administrative roles or through the use of assistive technology for conducting."

At the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with Eve. However, Eve is not one of the given options. We need to consider the final state of the dancers and the sequence of switches. The only option that fits logically is the last switch where Gertrude switches with Eve, and since Eve is not an option, we need to consider the final state of the dancers.

The final state of the dancers is:
- Alice: Claire
- Bob: Dave
- Claire: Alice
- Dave: Bob
- Eve: Gertrude
- Fred: Karl
- Gertrude: Eve

Given the options:
(A) Izzi.
(B) Helga.
(C) Sam.
(D) Karl.
(E) Patrick.
(F) Lola.
(G) Melissa.

Since Gertrude's partner at the end is Eve, and Eve is not an option, we need to consider the last switch where Gertrude switches with Eve, and the only logical final partner for Gertrude is the one that fits the sequence of switches and the given options. The only option that fits is:
