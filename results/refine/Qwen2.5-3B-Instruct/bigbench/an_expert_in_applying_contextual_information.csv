"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses as follows:

1. The flutist lives in house number 2.
2. The person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

Let's analyze the possible positions for the pianist:

- If the pianist lives in house number 3, then the guitarist must live in house number 2, which contradicts the fact that the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips.
- Therefore, the pianist must live in house number 4.

This leaves house number 3 for the person with the carnations arrangement and house number 1 for the person with the bouquet of lilies. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 2 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).

Thus, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **House 1:** The person who is eating kiwis.
2. **House 2:** The person who likes green.
3. **House 3:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy (they live next to each other).

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3.

From Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house, so the percussionist must live in house 1 or house 3. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the percussionist must live in house 3.

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy are in houses 2 and 3, the cellist must live in house 1.

From Clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 1.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green lives in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 8.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1 or house 2. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover. Since the person who only drinks water is in house 2, the person who has a television must be in house 1 or house 2. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who has a television must be in house 2.

From Clue 1, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who only drinks water is in house 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in house 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- **House 1:** Green (person who likes green)
- **House 2:** Water (person who only drinks water), Television (person who has a television), Grapes (person who is eating grapes)
- **House 3:** Blue (person who likes blue), Gameboy (person who has a gameboy), Root beer (person who drinks root beer)

Therefore, the cellist lives in **House 3**.

The correct answer is **(C) 3**."
"Let's deduce the correct placement of each person step by step:

1. **Person who likes red lives in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 2.

2. **Person who likes kiwis lives in the fifth house.**
   - This means the person who likes kiwis is in house 5.

3. **Person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes white can live in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.

4. **Person who likes oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes bananas.**
   - This means the person who likes oranges is in a house to the left of the person who likes bananas.

5. **Person who likes blue lives directly right of the person who likes red.**
   - Since the person who likes red is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 3.

6. **Person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the person who likes water is in a house to the right of the person who likes tea.

7. **Person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes green is in a house to the right of the person who likes red (house 2).

8. **Person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person who likes green is in a house to the right of the person who likes blue (house 3).

9. **Person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the person who likes green is in a house to the right of the person who likes white (houses 1, 2, 4, or 5).

10. **Person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes oranges.**
    - This means the person who likes green is in a house to the right of the person who likes oranges (houses 1, 2, 4, or 5).

11. **Person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes grapes.**
    - This means the person who likes green is in a house to the right of the person who likes grapes (houses 1, 2, 4, or 5).

12. **Person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes root beer.**
    - This means the person who likes green is in a house to the right of the person who likes root beer (houses 1, 2, 4, or 5).

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the person who likes green must live in house 5, as it is the only house that satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes green lives is **5**.

The correct answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person in house 3 is wearing high heels.
2. The person in house 2 is eating mangos and the person in house 4 is eating grapes.
3. The person in house 1 is wearing running shoes.
4. The person in house 2 is wearing running shoes, so the person in house 4 is the root beer lover.
5. The person in house 3 is eating mangos, so the person in house 4 is the tea drinker.
6. The person in house 1 is the coffee drinker.
7. The person in house 2 is the person who had pizza.
8. The person in house 3 is the person who is eating grapes.
9. The person in house 4 is the person who is wearing running shoes.

From the above deductions, the tea drinker lives in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 4**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From Clue 6, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3. From Clue 7, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 2 and 4. Given that the person who only drinks water lives in house 5, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 2 and 4. Since the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors, they must be in houses 2 and 4 in that order. Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 2 and the person who likes milk lives in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person who only drinks water lives in house 5. From Clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 2. This contradicts the placement of the person who had stew in house 2. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the person who had stew must be in house 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who had pizza (not in the first house)
- House 2: Person who had stew
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who likes milk
- House 5: Person who only drinks water

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the soccer player and the person eating oranges cannot be in houses 1 and 3, but they must be in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges.

From Clue 1 and Clue 4, we know the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2, and the person with daffodils must be in house 2. Therefore, the person eating oranges must be in house 1.

From Clue 2, the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 1 and the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person with daffodils
- House 3: Person with tulips

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions of the people in the houses:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The history book buff lives in House 3.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
5. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a radio lives one house away from the history book buff.
8. The person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist.

From these constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Violinist (ate spaghetti)
- House 3: History book buff (ate fried rice)
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone (must be next to each other)

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist, and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 (which is a contradiction since the violinist is already there). Therefore, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2, and the person with a phone must be in House 3.

This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips.

Thus, the person with a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the person who lives in the second house (Clue 2). This person is the mystery book reader.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Next, we use Clue 3 and Clue 6 to place the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast. The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the history book buff. The history book buff must be directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in House 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 5 to place the percussionist. The percussionist must be directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the computer must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the person who has a gameboy. The person who has a gameboy must be directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Finally, we use Clue 8 to place the cellist. The cellist cannot be in House 3. Since the cellist is not in House 3, the cellist must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy is in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the rose bouquet is in House 3, the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person wearing boots does not live in house 1, they must live in house 2.
- The person driving a convertible must live directly left of the history book buff. Therefore, if the history book buff lives in house 1, the person driving a convertible must live in house 2. But since the person in house 2 is wearing boots, this scenario is not possible. Thus, the history book buff must live in house 2, and the person driving a convertible must live in house 1.
- The person driving a truck must live in house 2 (since the person driving a truck is the only other car type left).

This leaves us with:
- House 1: Convertible driver (wearing sandals)
- House 2: Truck driver (wearing boots)

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct option is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
2. The person wearing high heels does not live in the second or fourth house. Therefore, they must live in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.
3. The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (second house) must be to the right of each other. This means the person wearing loafers must live in the fourth house.
4. The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the first and fourth houses are occupied, the only remaining houses are the second and third. The person wearing sandals must live in the second house, and the romance book lover must live in the third house.

Thus, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct option is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's reanalyze the clues with a focus on the constraints and logical placement of each person:

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's place the tea drinker in the first or fourth house. If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.
2. The fish enthusiast lives in house 2.
3. The person who had pizza lives in house 2.
4. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio, so the person who likes green (in house 2) must be directly left of the person who has a radio (in house 1).

From these, we can assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in house 1) must have a phone.
- The person who ate spaghetti (in house 2) must have a radio.
- The person who is a cat lover must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in house 1.

   - Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must live in house 2, 3, or 4.

5. **Clue 6:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

6. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2 or 4.

7. **Clue 13:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - Since the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts Clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Given these constraints, let's deduce the correct placement:

- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2 or 4.

"Given the clues and the constraints, let's re-evaluate the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner lives in house \(X\), the tulip owner lives in house \(X-1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the daffodils owner cannot live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the carnations owner lives in house \(X+1\) or \(X-1\).

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the lilies owner lives in house \(X+1\) or higher.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover lives in house 1.

Given the cat lover lives in house 1, we can start filling in the houses:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Daffodils (from Clue 2)
- House 3: Horse (from Clue 4, since the lilies owner must be to the right of the horse owner)
- House 4: Dog (from Clue 1, since the tulip owner must be to the left of the dog owner)
- House 5: Fish (remaining pet)

Now, let's verify the remaining clues:

- **Clue 1:** The tulip owner lives in house 4, and the dog owner lives in house 5.
- **Clue 2:** The daffodils owner lives in house 2.
- **Clue 3:** The horse owner lives in house 3, and the carnations owner lives in house 4 (which is consistent with the dog owner living in house 5).

- **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in house 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast must live in house 5.

The number of the house where the fish enthusiast lives is \(\boxed{5}\).

However, since the options provided are (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 1, (D) 4, and house 5 is not an option, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the options. Based on the given clues and logical deductions, the correct answer should be house 5."

We can deduce the following:

- House 1: Has a phone (Clue 1)
- House 2: Does not wear boots (Clue 2)
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio (Clue 3)

Since the person in house 1 has a phone, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Now, let's determine the pets and devices:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 cannot have a phone (because the person in house 1 has a phone), the person in house 1 must own horses. The person in house 2 must have a radio.

So, the characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people and their pets as follows:

1. The baseball player lives in the second house.
2. The basketball player does not live in the first house and lives to the left of the swimmer.
3. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner.
4. The bird keeper does not live in the first house and does not live in the third house.
5. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.

From clue 3, we know the baseball player is in House 2. From clue 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 (since they cannot be in House 1 and must be to the left of the swimmer). This leaves the swimmer to be in House 3. From clue 4, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4, and the dog owner must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast is to the right of the dog owner). This leaves the tennis player and the cat lover to be in Houses 1 and 4, with the tennis player being directly left of the cat lover. Therefore, the tennis player must be in House 1 and the cat lover in House 4.

Thus, the bird keeper must be in House 1, as it is the only house left for the bird keeper and it does not violate any of the given clues.

The number of the house where the bird keeper lives is **1**.

The correct option is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **White and Computer:**
   - The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - This means the computer owner cannot be in the first house, and the white lover cannot be in the first house either.

2. **Baseball Player and Blue:**
   - There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - This means the baseball player must be in house 2, and the person who likes blue must be in house 3.

3. **Sedan and SUV:**
   - The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the sedan owner and the SUV owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Sedan and Gameboy:**
   - The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - This means the sedan owner and the gameboy owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

5. **Violinist and First House:**
   - The violinist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the violinist must live in either house 2 or 3.

6. **Guitarist and White:**
   - The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the guitarist must live in a house to the right of the white lover.

### Deduction

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

From clue 1, we know:
- The computer owner cannot be in house 1, and the white lover cannot be in house 1.

From clue 3, we know:
- The sedan and SUV owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 4, we know:
- The sedan and gameboy owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 5, we know:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1.

From clue 6, we know:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover.

### Combining Clues

Let's place the known elements:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

Now, let's place the sedan and SUV:
- If the sedan is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (but house 2 is already taken by the baseball player).
- Therefore, the sedan must be in house 2, and the SUV must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

Now, we need to place the violinist and the white lover:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.
- The white lover must be in house 1 or 3.

Since the white lover cannot be in house 1 (because the computer owner is there), the white lover must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 2 for the sedan owner.

Now, we need to place the guitarist and the gameboy:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover (house 3), so the guitarist must be in house 3.
- The gameboy must be next to the sedan owner (house 2).

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

### Final Arrangement

- House 1: Computer owner
- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Person who likes blue

The remaining characteristics:
- The white lover is in house 3.
- The guitar is in house 3.
- The gameboy is in house 2.
- The violinist is in house 2.
- The baseball player is in house 2.
- The soccer player is in house 1.

Thus, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and the person who had fried rice lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live next to each other. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in the second and fourth houses. Given that the person who had pizza does not live in the third house (Clue 4), the person who had pizza must be in the second house, and the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who owns horses must be in the first or second house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who has a phone is in the fourth house, the person who owns horses must be in the first house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. The bird keeper must be in the second or third house, but since the cat lover is in the third house, the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the person who has a television must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who has a phone is in the fourth house, the person who has a television must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third or fourth house. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the fourth house, the person who had stew must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had stew is in the fifth house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house, but we already know the person who had fried rice is in the second house.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who has a phone
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Cat lover
- House 4: Person who has a television
- House 5: Person who had stew

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

All clues are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. The tea drinker does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
3. The person who likes red does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
5. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
6. There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
8. The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
9. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
10. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
11. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
12. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk lives in the third house. Let's denote this as:

- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. This is a contradiction because the milk drinker is already in the third house. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the setup. Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in the second house:

- House 2: Person who is eating apples

From Clue 1, the tea drinker does not live in the first house. Let's denote the tea drinker as:

- House 1: Tea drinker

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Let's denote the person who likes red as:

- House 4: Person who likes red

From Clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the fourth house:

- House 4: Person who likes milk
- House 5: Person who is eating a banana

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house and the person who is eating a banana is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house and the person who likes yellow must be in the third house:

- House 2: Person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who likes milk
- House 4: Person who is eating a banana
- House 5: Person who likes yellow

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the first or second house. Given the tea drinker is in the first house, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who likes milk
- House 4: Person who is eating a banana
- House 5: Person who likes yellow

Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes red must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the fifth house. The person who likes red is in the fourth house, and the person who likes yellow is in the fifth house. The person who drives a convertible must be to the left of the person who likes red, so the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who likes red
- House 4: Person who is eating a banana
- House 5: Person who likes yellow

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes red is in the fourth house and the person who only drinks water is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible must be to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who drives a convertible
- House 4: Person who is eating a banana
- House 5: Person who likes yellow

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a truck must be in the fifth house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who drives a convertible
- House 4: Person who likes blue
- House 5: Person who likes yellow

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must be in the fifth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the fourth house:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who drives a convertible
- House 4: Person who is eating mangos
- House 5: Person who likes green

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fifth house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the fourth house:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who drives a convertible
- House 4: Person who owns a sedan
- House 5: Person who likes green

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The person eating a banana lives in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the second house.
4. The person who owns an SUV must live in the first house because the person who owns an SUV cannot live in the third house (Clue 2) and the person who drives a truck cannot live in the first house (Clue 3).

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.

We can deduce the following:
- The first house is occupied by the swimmer.
- The third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.
- The second house must be occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, as they live directly left of the fried rice eater.

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses step by step:

1. **Cricketer lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Cricketer

2. **The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means the sedan owner and the cat lover are not in adjacent houses.

3. **The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means the sedan owner and the horse owner are adjacent.

4. **The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.**
   - This means the truck driver and the basketball player are not in adjacent houses.

Let's place the people in the houses based on these clues:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: (S, C, H, T)
- House 3: (S, C, H, T)

Since the cricketer is in house 1, the sedan owner (S) and the horse owner (H) must be in houses 2 and 3. Also, the cat lover (C) must be in a house adjacent to the sedan owner (S) or the horse owner (H).

Let's try placing the sedan owner (S) and the horse owner (H) in houses 2 and 3:

- House 2: S (sedan owner)
- House 3: H (horse owner)

This leaves the cat lover (C) and the truck driver (T) to be placed in houses 2 and 3. Since the cat lover (C) must be adjacent to the sedan owner (S), and the horse owner (H) is already in house 3, the cat lover (C) must be in house 2. This leaves the truck driver (T) to be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Cat lover (C)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)

Since the truck driver (T) lives in house 3, the basketball player (B) must live in house 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house 2.

The correct option is (B) 2."

Thus, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."

2. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives in the second house.
   - Saxophonist in house 2.

3. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the pizza eater must be in house 3 or 4. But since the tea drinker is in house 4, the pizza eater must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the cellist and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - This means the person who only drinks water and the person who is wearing loafers must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the cellist must be in house 3.

7. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

8. **Clue 4:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2 or 3. But since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the person who likes milk must be in a house to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

10. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2. This means the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3.

11. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
    - Since the cellist is in house 3, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the cellist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cellist lives is (C) 3."

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. From Clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, so the truck driver must be in house 2 and the basketball player in house 1. From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner, and the sedan owner must be in house 4 (minivan driver's house). Therefore, the sedan owner must be in house 4, and the swimmer in house 2. From Clue 2, the daffodils and lilies must be in adjacent houses, and from Clue 5, the lilies must be to the right of the basketball player, so the lilies must be in house 4 (minivan driver's house) and the daffodils in house 3 (root beer lover's house). This leaves house 1 for the coffee drinker and house 4 for the sedan owner. From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player must be in houses 1 and 4, but house 4 is already taken by the sedan owner. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the tennis player in house 4. This leaves house 2 for the truck driver and house 3 for the root beer lover.

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(A) 1**."

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - Convertible: House 2 or 3
   - Science fiction book fanatic: House 1 or 2

4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - Fantasy book enthusiast and Coffee drinker: Houses 2 and 3 or 1 and 2

5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - Oranges: House 1 or 3

Let's analyze the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the second house (Clue 4).
2. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader (Clue 1). Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house (Clue 3). Hence, the person who likes white must live in the first house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house (Clue 2). Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

Thus, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - If the SUV owner is in house 3, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 must be the person who drives a convertible.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. But house 1 is already taken by the person who drives a convertible, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - The person who drives a convertible is in house 1, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - The person who drives a minivan must be in house 2 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible), and the dog owner must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
   - The person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, and house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV). The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 4. Since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The bird keeper is in house 4, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

8. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - The person who drives a minivan is in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, the history book buff must be in house 1.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos), and the romance book lover must be in house 4.

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
    - The person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

   - House 2: Person with a rose bouquet.

2. **Clue 1**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker. This means:
   - If the television is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet).
   - If the television is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 3.
   - If the television is in house 3, the tea drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet).

   Therefore, the television must be in house 1 and the tea drinker must be in house 3.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker. This means:
   - The coffee drinker must be in a house with a lower number than the person eating kiwis.

4. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker does not live in the second house. This is already satisfied by the placement of the tea drinker in house 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist. This means:
   - The television is in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means:
   - If the flutist lives in house 1, the person eating a banana must live in house 3.
   - If the flutist lives in house 2, the person eating a banana must live in house 1.
   - If the flutist lives in house 3, the person eating a banana must live in house 2.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio. This means:
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 3, the person with a radio must be in house 1.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2, the person with a radio must be in house 1.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 1, the person with a radio must be in house 1.

Given the above deductions, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1**: Person with a radio, eating bananas, and having a vase of tulips.
- **House 2**: Person with a rose bouquet.
- **House 3**: Person with a television, guitarist, and eating kiwis.

The root beer lover must live in house 1, as that is the only house left.

### Conclusion

(C) 1"
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast.

2. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
   - This means the person eating apples and the person wearing boots must be in houses 2 and 4 or 1 and 3.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 2**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in either the fourth house or the fifth house (but since there are only 4 houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house).

7. **Clue 1**: The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the second house.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person eating a banana must live in either the fourth or the fifth house. But since there are only 4 houses, the person eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Second house: History book buff
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic (from Clue 2 and Clue 6)
- First house: Person eating mangos (from Clue 5 and Clue 3)
- Fourth house: Person eating a banana (from Clue 8)
- Fifth house: Person eating apples (from Clue 4 and Clue 3)

Since the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house, and the fourth house is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person eating apples must live in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: History book buff
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house (number 1). Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house (number 2).
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house (number 2). Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house (number 1).
3. The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the flutist lives in the first house (number 1), the person who likes white must live in the second house (number 2).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house (number 2), the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house (number 1).

From these deductions, we can summarize the characteristics as follows:
- **First House (Number 1)**:
  - Flutist
  - Wearing loafers
  - Owns an SUV

- **Second House (Number 2)**:
  - Person who likes white
  - Wearing sandals
  - Owns an SUV

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2).

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. **Clue 6:** The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

From Clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house (house 3).

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (Clue 3), the person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who drives a minivan must live in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the sedan owner cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), the sedan owner must be in house 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3. But house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the sedan owner must be in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who is eating apples must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the sedan owner and the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 1, and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From Clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

From Clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person wearing loafers step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person wearing boots cannot be in house 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a phone must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person with a television and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses, but the television must be to the left of the fried rice.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not white

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the person wearing sandals and the person with a gameboy must be in adjacent houses, but the sandals must be to the left of the gameboy.

7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4 or 4 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 2 and 4).

8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not stew

9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the cat lover must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Grilled cheese

11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - This means the cat lover and the dog owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the cat lover is already in house 4 or 5, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2).

12. **Clue 12:** The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
    - House 2: High heels

13. **Clue 13:** The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Not red

14. **Clue 14:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - This means the person with a gameboy and the person wearing loafers must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

15. **Clue 15:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
    - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a radio must be in adjacent houses, but the fish enthusiast must be to the left of the radio.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
    - This means the person who owns horses and the person with a television must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the person with a television is already in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 1).

17. **Clue 17:** The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
    - House 4: Blue

18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
    - House 3: Not boots

19. **Clue 19:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
    - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes white must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew
- House 4: Blue, loafers, not white
- House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew
- House 6: Not white, not red, not stew

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The correct answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person living in the first house (house 1) has a television. Since the person in the first house has a television, the person in the second house (house 2) must have the computer (since there is only one computer and one television).

From clue 1, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house (house 2).

Now we know:
- The person in the first house (house 1) has a television.
- The person in the second house (house 2) has a computer.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic (SFF) and the golfer (Golfer) must be in different houses, and Golfer must be to the right of SFF.
   - Possible positions: Golfer in House 2, SFF in House 1.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza-eater (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) must be in adjacent houses.
   - Possible positions: PE in House 1, HBB in House 2 or PE in House 2, HBB in House 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D.
   - Possible positions: G in House 2, D in House 1 or G in House 1, D in House 2.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1, Golfer is in House 2 and SFF is in House 1.
- From Clue 2, PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since Golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.
- From Clue 3, G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"
"Given the constraints and the information provided, let's deduce the correct placement of the percussionist:

1. **House 1: Dog owner (since the dog owner is not in house 2)**

2. **House 2: Phone**

3. **House 3: Television**

4. **House 4: Violinist**

5. **House 5: Bird keeper**

Now, we need to place the remaining people and devices:
- The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses are neighbors.
- The flutist and the person who has a television are neighbors.
- The television is to the left of the radio.
- The guitarist is to the right of the percussionist.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.
2. The basketball player does not live in house 1, so the basketball player must live in house 2.
3. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2.

From these deductions, we can conclude that the violinist lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Let's start by placing the known individuals:

- Tennis player: 3rd house
- Grilled cheese: 5th house
- Golfer: 4th house
- Stew: 1st house (since there is one house between the person who ate spaghetti and the person who had fried rice, and the 4th house is occupied by the golfer, the only valid positions for stew and spaghetti are 1st and 3rd houses. Since the 3rd house is occupied by the tennis player, stew must be in the 1st house and spaghetti in the 3rd house.)
- Pizza: 2nd house (since the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer, and the cricketer must be in the 2nd house or 5th house, but the 5th house is occupied by grilled cheese, the cricketer must be in the 2nd house.)
- Fried rice: 2nd house (since the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer, and the cricketer is in the 2nd house, the person who had fried rice must be in the 2nd house.)

Now, we have:
- 1st house: Stew
- 2nd house: Pizza, Fried rice
- 3rd house: Tennis player, Spaghetti
- 4th house: Golfer
- 5th house: Grilled cheese

Since the cricketer must be in the 2nd house (as the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer and the cricketer must be in the 2nd house or 5th house, but the 5th house is occupied by grilled cheese), the cricketer lives in the 2nd house.

Thus, the number of the house where the cricketer lives is 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house (Clue 1).
   - Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (house 2).

2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who likes white must live in house 1.

3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other (Clue 3).
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.

4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other (Clue 4).
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water, Person who likes white, Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2).
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (lives in house 1), Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2), Person who likes red, Person who plays baseball (lives in house 1), Person who wears loafers (lives in house 2).

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(A) 2**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to the houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively. We will use the clues to deduce the positions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

**Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"Given the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house.

We can deduce the following:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Tennis player

- The person who likes fantasy books must live in house 2 (since the tennis player lives in house 2 and the tennis player plays tennis).
- The person who likes mystery books lives in house 1.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- The baseball player lives in the second house.
- The person driving a convertible also lives in the second house.
- Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.
- Consequently, the person eating mangos must live in the first house.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the second house (Clue 2).
2. The person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis (Clue 3), so the person who is eating kiwis must be in the first house.
3. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges (Clue 4), so the person who is eating apples is in the first house and the person who is eating oranges is in the third house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green (Clue 1), and since the person who likes green must be in the first house (because the person who likes blue is in the second house), the person who likes white must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 3 (but there is no house 3, so this is not possible).

2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses, with the soccer player in house 1 and the mystery book reader in house 2, or vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the person with the gameboy must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person with the gameboy is in house 1.
- The mystery book reader is in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player is in house 1 (since the mystery book reader is in house 2).

From Clue 1, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 (since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, Gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Root beer, Rose bouquet

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's analyze these clues:

- From Clue 4, the fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses.
- From Clue 2, the truck and the sedan must be separated by two houses.
- From Clue 3, the truck and the sedan must be directly adjacent.
- From Clue 1, the minivan must be to the right of the fish enthusiast.

Let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

1. **Dog owner in house 3:**
   - Truck must be in house 2 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 4 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 3).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration works:
   - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
   - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
   - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
   - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

2. **Dog owner in house 4:**
   - Truck must be in house 3 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 2 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 3 and the dog owner is in house 4).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and clues, let's re-evaluate the placement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Likes yellow (Y)

2. **Clue 4**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Likes root beer (R)

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (W)
- House 2: Likes root beer (R)
- House 3: Likes yellow (Y)
- House 4: Likes blue (B)

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."

- **House 3:** Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes, Person wearing loafers

### Conclusion

The person who likes white (the only color left) must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (as house 1 is taken by the dog owner and baseball player), the bird keeper must be in house 3.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

"Given the clues and the positions deduced, we can confirm the following:

1. House 1: Romance book lover
2. House 2: Swimming
3. House 3: Tennis player
4. House 4: Cricketer
5. House 5: Blue

From the clues, we know:
- The person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 (Clue 5).
- The person who likes green lives in a house with one house between the romance book lover and the mystery book reader (Clue 13).

Since the romance book lover is in House 1 and the mystery book reader is in House 4, the person who likes green must be in House 3. This leaves House 2 for the person who is eating mangos.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 2, and the person who likes green lives in House 3. The history book buff must live in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the history book buff lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

We need to determine the house number where the dog owner lives.

Let's analyze the possible arrangements:

- If the cellist is in house 1, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 2 (since the cellist is to the left of the gameboy owner).
- If the cellist is in house 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 1, but this contradicts the first clue since the cellist would then be to the right of the gameboy owner.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- Cellist in house 1
- Gameboy owner in house 2

This leaves house 1 for the dog owner.

Thus, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the devices and vehicles:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person with a phone and the person with an SUV must be adjacent, and the phone must be to the left of the SUV.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, and considering the remaining houses (2 and 4), the only possible arrangement is:
- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses as follows:

1. The soccer player lives in house number 3.
2. The golfer and the basketball player are adjacent and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the soccer player is in house 3, the person with lilies must be in house 2, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1.

10. The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
12. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This is a contradiction because Clue 7 states the person who likes red lives in the third house. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's assume Clue 9 is correct and the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This means Clue 7 is incorrect, and the person who likes red does not live in the third house.

Now, let's re-evaluate the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: The pianist lives in the third house.
- Clue 4: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 5: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
- Clue 6: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
- Clue 8: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
- Clue 10: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
- Clue 11: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
- Clue 12: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

Let's assign the remaining houses:

- The third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.
- The fifth house is occupied by the person who likes red.

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- The first house is occupied by the person who likes blue.
- The second house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.
- The fifth house is occupied by the person who likes red.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The tea drinker lives in house 3.
2. The person who ate stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 2, the person who had stew must be in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, the only possible houses for the person who only drinks water are house 3 or house 4.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew. This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

Let's summarize the possible placements:
- House 1: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 2: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 3: Tea drinker (from Clue 1)
- House 4: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, the only possible houses for the person who ate grilled cheese are house 2 or house 3. However, house 3 is already occupied by the tea drinker. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese, house 4 is the only option left for the person who only drinks water.

Now, we have:
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 1 for the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), house 1 is the only option left for the person who had stew.

This leaves house 4 for the person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 5). The person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew, and the only option left is house 4.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 4.

From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. From Clue 2, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Sixth house: person who had stew (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the sixth house)
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who had stew
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above analysis, the person with the computer lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{C}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses as follows:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Likes white

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not wearing boots

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not a bird keeper

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils

5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Likes green (since it's directly left of the person wearing running shoes)

6. **Clue 6:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - House 3: Owns horses
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 1: Likes white

7. **Clue 7:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

From Clue 7, we know that the person who owns horses lives in House 3 and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in House 2.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who owns horses (House 3) and the person who has daffodils (House 2) are next to each other, the person who likes green must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3. However, since the person who owns horses is already in House 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Likes white, Wearing sandals
- House 2: Has daffodils, Wearing running shoes
- House 3: Owns horses, Wearing boots

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The person eating apples lives in the third house.
   - Arrangement: House 1: ?, House 2: ?, House 3: Person eating apples

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house.
   - Arrangement: House 1: ?, House 2: Person eating mangos, House 3: Person eating apples

3. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - The coffee drinker cannot be in the second house (Clue 3).
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.
   - The person who likes milk must be in the third house.
   - Arrangement: House 1: Coffee drinker, House 2: Person eating mangos, House 3: Person who likes milk

4. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This is already satisfied by the arrangement.

5. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - This is already satisfied by the arrangement.

From the above deductions, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the placement of the people in the houses as follows:

1. The person who only drinks water lives in house 1.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3 because there is one house between the person who only drinks water (house 1) and the person who likes milk, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 2) must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who likes milk lives in house 3.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 1 because house 1 is the only remaining house and the person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in house 2 (where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives) or house 3 (where the person who likes milk lives).

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's reanalyze the clues with a focus on the logical placement of each person and their attributes:

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**

From clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1. From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, so the person who is wearing sandals must live in house 4. This means the cricketer lives in house 3.

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in house 3. Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 4 (clue 3).

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in house 2. From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in house 4, the person who has a phone must live in house 1 or 2. But the person who is wearing loafers (clue 9) lives in house 1, so the person who has a phone must live in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone (in house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a radio. This means the person who has a radio lives in house 3. But house 3 is already occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in house 3. This is a contradiction because house 3 is already occupied by the person who likes yellow. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 4. The person who is wearing sandals must live in house 4. The person who likes green must live in house 1 (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1). The person who has a phone must live in house 2 (since the person who has a phone does not live in house 2 and the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio).

This leaves the cricketer to live in house 2, but this contradicts the placement of the person who has a phone. Therefore, the cricketer must live in house 2.

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (house number 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and the romance book lover must be to the left of the history book buff. Given that the romance book lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 3), the only possible arrangement for houses 1 and 2 is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: History book buff

From Clue 1, the person who likes green must be to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1. However, this contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who likes yellow is in house 1. Therefore, we need to reassess the positions.

Given Clue 3, the person who had pizza cannot be in house 1. Since the romance book lover is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

Now, we need to place the person who likes green and the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who likes green must be to the left of the history book buff and the history book buff is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1, which contradicts Clue 4. Therefore, we need to place the person who likes green in house 2, and the person who ate fried rice in house 3.

Thus, the correct arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

The person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step.

### Clue 1: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
This means the tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be in a house to the left of the television.

### Clue 2: The golfer does not live in the second house.
This means the golfer cannot be in house number 2.

### Clue 3: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
This means the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses.

### Clue 4: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
This means the radio and rose bouquet must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the rose bouquet.

### Clue 5: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.
This means the radio and television must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on Clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

### Case 1: Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Television (V) in house 2

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

### Checking the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who is wearing sandals:

1. **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Swimmer

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot live in house 5, and the carnations arrangement cannot live in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the tulips person is in house X+1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means if the running shoes person is in house X, the daffodils person is in house X+1.

5. **Clue 5:** The violinist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Violinist

6. **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means if the basketball player is in house X, the guitarist is in house X+1.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the high heels person is in house X, the lilies person is in house X+1.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - This means if the loafers person is in house X, the percussionist is in house X+1.

9. **Clue 9:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Cricketer

10. **Clue 10:** The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
    - This means they must be in houses X and X+1.

11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

12. **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
    - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the cellist must be in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

Given the constraints, let's place the remaining people:

- **House 1:** Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
- **House 2:** Violinist.
- **House 3:** Swimmer.
- **House 4:** Cricketer.
- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils.

Since the daffodils person is in house 5, the sandals person must be in house 1 (as they must be directly left of the tulips person).

Thus, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (E) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The fish enthusiast lives in house 1.
- The person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

Since the person in house 2 (high heels) ate grilled cheese, the person in house 1 (fish enthusiast) cannot be the one who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner, and the person in house 2 must be the fish enthusiast (wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese).

This leaves the person in house 1 to be the dog owner and the person in house 2 to be the fish enthusiast.

Since the person in house 1 is the dog owner, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who had stew lives is 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house where the person eating oranges lives:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
4. **Clue 4:** The flutist lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
9. **Clue 10:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
11. **Clue 11:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
12. **Clue 12:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
14. **Clue 14:** The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
15. **Clue 15:** The science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2, the person with a phone lives in the third house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

From Clue 4, the flutist lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the flutist.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. This contradicts Clue 2, so we need to re-evaluate. Since Clue 2 states the phone lives in the third house, and Clue 6 states the running shoes live in the third house, we need to consider the possibility that the phone and running shoes are different people.

From Clue 1, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Let's denote the person eating grapes as G and the person eating oranges as O. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From Clue 5, the person eating oranges (O) lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots (B). From Clue 3, the saxophonist (S) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots (B). This means B must be to the right of S.

From Clue 7, the romance book lover (R) lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF). This means R and SF must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels (HH) lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast (FB) lives. This means HH and FB must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 5 (but since we only have 4 houses, it must be 1 and 4).

From Clue 12, the history book buff (HB) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges (O). This means HB must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 13, the person eating kiwis (K) does not live in the first house. So K must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 14, the percussionist (P) lives in the fourth house. So P is in house 4.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic (SF) and the person who is wearing running shoes (RS) live directly next to each other. Since RS lives in the third house, SF must live in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: HB (History book buff)
- House 2: SF (Science fiction book fanatic)
- House 3: RS (Running shoes)
- House 4: P (Percussionist)

Since the person eating oranges (O) must be to the right of the person wearing boots (B) and B must be to the right of S, and O must be to the right of B, the only possible positions for O and B are:
- O in house 4 (since P is in house 4)
- B in house 3 (since RS is in house 3)

This leaves the person eating grapes (G) and the person wearing boots (B) in houses 1 and 2. Since HB is in house 1, B must be in house 2, and G must be in house 1.

So, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house where the person who is eating apples lives:

1. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house. So, the person who had stew can live in houses 1, 2, or 4.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who only drinks water must live in the next house to the right of the person who had stew.
3. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the person who likes white must live in a house to the right of the person who had stew.
4. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

From Clue 9 and Clue 10, the person who had stew must live in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must live in house 2. The person who likes white must live in house 4.
- From Clue 6, the person who had pizza must live in house 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in house 3.
- From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 1, and the person who is eating apples must live in house 4.

Thus, the person who is eating apples lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Convertible lives in House 1.**
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **SUV lives directly left of the History book buff.**
   - House 2: SUV
   - House 3: History book buff

3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.**
   - House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
   - House 4: Fried rice

4. **Grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the History book buff.**
   - House 4: Grilled cheese

5. **Truck lives directly left of the Mystery book reader.**
   - House 2: Truck
   - House 3: Mystery book reader

6. **Person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - House 1: Running shoes
   - House 2: High heels

7. **Person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - House 1: Boots
   - House 4: Sandals

8. **Person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the Science fiction book fanatic.**
   - House 1: Stew
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

9. **Person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - House 1: Convertible
   - House 2: Boots

From the above deductions, we can confirm the arrangement:

- **House 1:** Boots, Convertible, Running shoes, Stew
- **House 2:** SUV, Science fiction book fanatic, Truck, Mystery book reader
- **House 3:** History book buff, Fantasy book enthusiast, Fried rice, High heels
- **House 4:** Grilled cheese, Mystery book reader, Fried rice, Pizza

The person who had pizza lives in **House 4**.

Thus, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know:
- The fourth house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
- The fourth house is also occupied by the saxophonist.

Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other, the violinist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house and the percussionist is in the third house, the history book buff must be in the second house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the percussionist is in the third house and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, this clue is consistent.

Thus, the positions are:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover (violinist)
- **House 3:** Saxophonist (percussionist)
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the characteristics of the people living in each house step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Television

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers (already determined)
   - House 3: Phone (since the phone cannot be in house 2)

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - House 1: Boots
   - House 2: Loafers

5. **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - House 1: Boots
   - House 2: Loafers
   - House 3: Phone
   - House 4: Television

From Clue 5, we know the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since house 2 is already occupied by loafers, the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3.

**Scenario 1: Radio in house 1, Sandals in house 3**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 1: Radio
- House 3: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which contradicts Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

**Scenario 2: Radio in house 3, Sandals in house 1**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 3: Radio
- House 1: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which is consistent with Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

The person who has a gameboy lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues:

3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

We can deduce the following:

- The person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.
- The coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, so the coffee drinker must be in either house number 1 or house number 3.
- The person who likes milk cannot be in house number 1, so the person who likes milk must be in either house number 2 or house number 3.
- The person who likes milk cannot be in house number 2 (since the high heels person is there), so the person who likes milk must be in house number 3.
- Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in house number 1.

Thus, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person wearing loafers cannot live in the first house (Clue 1), they must live in the second house.
- The mystery book reader cannot live in the second house (Clue 2), so the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

This leaves the history book buff to live in the second house, and the person wearing high heels to live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's place the people and their possessions step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots (B) lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's try different placements:

- If P is in house 1, then S must be in house 2 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 2, then B must be in house 1 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P. So, let's try another arrangement:

- If P is in house 2, then S must be in house 3 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 3, then B must be in house 2 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is also not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P.

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is possible. Let's check the other clues with this arrangement:

- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).

- **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's place the remaining items:

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4.
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (Clue 9).
- If R is in house 2, then G must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If T is in house 1, then C must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If R is in house 2, then St must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- If Rb is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 8).

4. **Clue 17:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given Clue 15, the person with a radio is in House 1, and the person with a computer is not in House 3 (Clue 9), so the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the coffee drinker is in House 4, the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3.
5. **Clue 14:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the basketball player and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given the possible placements, the only valid pair is (2, 3).

"Given the clues, let's reanalyze the information to determine the house where the person who drives a truck lives.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

### Analysis:
- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.
- From Clue 2, the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
- From Clue 3, the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

Let's consider the possible placements:

1. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

2. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

3. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

4. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

5. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

### Conclusion:
The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the information provided, let's deduce the correct house number where the person who likes milk lives.

From the clues:
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic (since the violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic and not in house 4)
- House 2: Not science fiction book fanatic
- House 1: Romance book lover (since the romance book lover does not live in the third house)
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

Since the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other (Clue 15), and the violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 9), we can deduce the following:

1. The violinist cannot be in house 4 (Clue 8).
2. The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
3. The violinist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 11).
4. The violinist must be in house 1 or 3.

Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 3 (Clue 11), the violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 1).

So, the person who likes milk must be in house 2 (Clue 15).

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the constraints and the information provided, let's reorganize the houses based on the clues:

1. **First house**: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
2. **Fourth house**: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Third house**: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
4. **Second house**: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The correct option is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Green and Yellow**: The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who likes green.
   - Therefore, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

2. **Stew and Grilled Cheese**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

3. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

4. **Grilled Cheese**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

5. **Romance Book Lover**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the romance book lover lives in the second house, which is consistent with the previous information.

### Summary of Arrangement

- **First House**: Person who ate grilled cheese
- **Second House**: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- **Third House**: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

### Determining the Person Who Likes Blue

- The person who likes green lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

The correct option is (C) 1."
"Given the constraints and clues, let's deduce the house where the bird keeper lives step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- First house: Carnations (person with carnations)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Second house: Vase of tulips and bird keeper
- Fourth house: Rose bouquet and person who likes blue (next to the person who owns horses)
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Second house: Percussionist or cellist
- Third house: Truck (next to the percussionist or cellist)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Given that the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist cannot both live in the first house, let's consider the possibility that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house and the cellist lives in the second house (number 2).

Now, let's use clue 3: the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the first house (number 1) is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the person who likes green must live in the second house (number 2), and the person who likes red must live in the first house (number 1).

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

"Given the clues:

1. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. The history book buff lives in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

From Clue 3, the history book buff lives in the first house. So, the arrangement is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, let's use Clue 1: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Now, the swimmer must live in the first or third house. But since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the swimmer must live in the first house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Thus, the swimmer lives in the first house.

13. **The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

14. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
    - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who has a rose bouquet:

1. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means if the minivan driver is in house 2, the person wearing boots must be in house 1.
   - If the minivan driver is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

2. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the person with pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the person with pizza must be in house 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, the person with pizza must be in house 3 (but this is not possible since the person with pizza must be to the right).

3. **The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person wearing running shoes must live in either house 2 or 3.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means if the person with tulips is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 1.
   - If the person with tulips is in house 3, the cricketer must be in house 2.

5. **The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with pizza must live in either house 1 or 3.

6. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means if the person with grilled cheese is in house 2, the person with sedan must be in house 1.
   - If the person with grilled cheese is in house 3, the person with sedan must be in house 2.

7. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person driving a minivan is in house 3.

8. **The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1.

9. **The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must live in either house 1 or 3.

From clue 7, the person driving a minivan is in house 3. From clue 8, the golfer is in house 1. From clue 5, the person who had pizza cannot be in house 2, so the person who had pizza must be in house 1 or 3. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From clue 4, the cricketer must be in house 1 (since the person with tulips cannot be in house 1). From clue 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2 (since the person wearing boots cannot be in house 1 and the person wearing running shoes cannot be in house 1).

From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since the person with sedan must be in house 1).

From clue 2, the person with pizza (in house 3) must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since the person with pizza is in house 3, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

13. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.

- House 5: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes yellow

- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes yellow
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 2: Flutist
- House 1: Cellist

The only house left for the percussionist is House 5.

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice
- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes yellow
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 2: Flutist
- House 1: Cellist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in House 5.

The correct answer is (B) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes white:

1. **Fried Rice is in house 3.**
2. **White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.**
3. **Stew cannot be in house 2 or 4.**
4. **Stew cannot be in house 4.**
5. **Green cannot be in house 2.**
6. **Red lives directly left of the person who had stew.**
7. **White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.**
8. **There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.**

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If White is in house 2, Yellow must be in house 4 (Clue 8).
- If White is in house 2, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (Clue 1).
- If White is in house 2, Yellow is in house 4, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 4 (Clue 6).

This configuration does not work because Red cannot be in house 4.

- If White is in house 4, Yellow must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If White is in house 4, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (Clue 1).
- If White is in house 4, Yellow is in house 2, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 5 (Clue 6).

This configuration works:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: White
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The percussionist lives in house 2.
2. The person who likes red lives in house 3.
3. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in house 2.
5. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.

Let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Not occupied (since the percussionist is in house 2)
- House 2: Occupied by the percussionist
- House 3: Occupied by the person who likes red
- House 4: Not occupied (since the person who likes red is in house 3)

We need to place the remaining people (the violinist, the tennis player, and the basketball player) in houses 1, 2, and 4.

From Clue 1, the violinist must be in a house to the right of the basketball player. This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 3, the basketball player must be to the right of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 4, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2.

Let's place the violinist and the basketball player:
- Since the violinist must be to the right of the basketball player, and the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 4.
- This leaves house 1 for the tennis player and house 3 for the person who likes red.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: Person who likes red
- House 4: Violinist

Therefore, the basketball player must be in house 1.

The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house (houses 1, 2, 4, 5).
2. **Clue 1**: The person who has a computer lives directly left of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 10**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
4. **Clue 12**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. **Clue 13**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
6. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
7. **Clue 15**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house (houses 1, 2, 4).
8. **Clue 16**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

From Clue 7, 15, and 16, the person who has a carnations arrangement can only live in houses 1 or 2.
From Clue 1, 12, and 13, the root beer lover can only live in houses 1 or 2.
From Clue 10, the coffee drinker can only live in houses 3 or 4.
From Clue 14, the bouquet of daffodils can only live in houses 1 or 2.
From Clue 1, the computer can only live in houses 1 or 2.
From Clue 12, the percussionist can only live in houses 4 or 5.
From Clue 13, the person who has a bouquet of lilies can only live in houses 3 or 4.
From Clue 14, the coffee drinker can only live in houses 3 or 4.
From Clue 10, the coffee drinker can only live in houses 3 or 4.
From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement can only live in houses 1 or 2.

Given all these constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Coffee drinker
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies
- House 5: Percussionist

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (E) 1."

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.

Let's start by placing the dog owner in the second house based on Clue 3.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Next, we place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who drives a truck based on Clue 4 and Clue 12.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck, and there are two houses between the truck and the convertible, we can place the truck and the convertible.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Let's place the truck in House 4 and the convertible in House 6 (since there are two houses between the truck and the convertible, and the convertible must be in the fifth house).

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast

### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck

Next, we place the person who has a bouquet of lilies based on Clue 5.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The bouquet of lilies cannot be in House 5, so it must be in House 3.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

Next, we place the person who has a vase of tulips based on Clue 10.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The vase of tulips must be to the left of the person who owns horses, and the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. The convertible is in House 5, so the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

Now, we place the person who has a computer based on Clue 8.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips

### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

Finally, we place the person who has a television and the person who owns an SUV based on Clue 17.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a television must be in House 3, and the person who owns an SUV must be in House 5.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Television
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: SUV

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The basketball player lives in house 1.
2. The saxophonist lives in house 1.
3. The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
4. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
5. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
6. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Let's analyze the possible positions for the fish enthusiast and the cat lover based on Clue 1:

### Possible positions for the fish enthusiast and the cat lover:
- If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the cat lover must be in house 3.
- If the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the cat lover must be in house 2.

### Case 1: Fish enthusiast in house 2, Cat lover in house 3
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Fish enthusiast (tea drinker, pizza eater)
- House 3: Cat lover (cricketer, dog owner)

Now, let's place the remaining people based on the other clues:
- The tea drinker must be in house 2 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The cricketer must be in house 3 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The person who only drinks water must be in house 1 (since the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast).
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).
- The dog owner must be in house 3 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).

This configuration does not work because the cat lover and the fish enthusiast cannot be in adjacent houses.

### Case 2: Fish enthusiast in house 3, Cat lover in house 2
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Cat lover (tea drinker, pizza eater)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (cricketer, dog owner)

Now, let's place the remaining people based on the other clues:
- The tea drinker must be in house 2 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The cricketer must be in house 3 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The person who only drinks water must be in house 1 (since the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast).
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).
- The dog owner must be in house 3 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).

This configuration works:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Cat lover (tea drinker, pizza eater)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (cricketer, dog owner)

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

4. The person wearing loafers lives in house 1.
5. The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils, and since the person with loafers is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1. Therefore, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.
6. The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1.

Thus, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. 

From clue 1, we know that the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in house 1. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"From the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 2).

Given these deductions, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is 3.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the root beer lover cannot be in the second house (house 2), the root beer lover must be in the first house (house 1).
- The pianist and the cellist must be in the remaining houses, and they must be in adjacent houses with the pianist to the left of the cellist.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person and their corresponding items:

1. **Clue 7**: The person with carnations lives in the fifth house.
   - Fifth house: Person with carnations.

2. **Clue 6**: The person with tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - Fourth house: Not tulips.

3. **Clue 8**: The person with tulips lives directly left of the person with loafers.
   - This means the person with tulips and the person with loafers are adjacent, and the person with tulips is to the left of the person with loafers.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person with running shoes lives and where the person with lilies lives.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are separated by one house.

5. **Clue 5**: The person with tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person with daffodils.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are in different houses, and the person with tulips is to the right of the person with daffodils.

6. **Clue 2**: The person with tulips lives directly left of the person with loafers.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are adjacent, and the person with tulips is to the left of the person with loafers.

7. **Clue 1**: The person with boots and the person with carnations live directly next to each other.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are adjacent, and the person with boots is to the left of the person with carnations.

8. **Clue 3**: The person with sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - This means the fifth house is not occupied by the person with sandals.

9. **Clue 8**: The person with running shoes and the person with daffodils are adjacent.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are adjacent.

Let's place the people based on the clues:
- Fifth house: Person with carnations.
- Fourth house: Not tulips.
- Third house: Not daffodils (since daffodils and running shoes are adjacent).
- Second house: Not tulips (since tulips are to the right of daffodils).
- First house: Not sandals (since sandals are not in the fifth house).

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- The person with sandals is not in the fifth house, so the person with sandals must be in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house (since the fifth house is occupied by carnations and the fourth house is not occupied by sandals).
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with tulips is in the third house (since it is to the right of the person with daffodils and adjacent to the person with loafers).
- The person with daffodils is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with running shoes and the person with tulips is in the third house).
- The person with running shoes is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with daffodils and one house away from the person with lilies).
- The person with lilies is in the fourth house (since it is one house away from the person with running shoes).

Thus, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the pianist step by step:

1. **Baseball player in house 2.**
2. **Swimmer and white next to each other.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).
3. **One house between blue and oranges.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).
4. **One house between white and tea drinker.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).
5. **Blue to the left of tea drinker.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

From clue 2, since the baseball player is in house 2, the possible pairs for the swimmer and white are (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

From clue 3, the blue person and the oranges person are not adjacent, so they must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4.

From clue 4, the white person and the tea drinker are not adjacent, so they must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4.

From clue 5, the blue person must be to the left of the tea drinker, so the possible pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

Let's combine these clues:

- If the white person is in house 2, then the tea drinker must be in house 3 (since they are one house apart).
- If the blue person is in house 1, then the oranges person must be in house 3 (since they are one house apart).

This leaves the following:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: White
- House 3: Tea drinker, Oranges
- House 4: Green, Pianist, Coffee drinker, or Percussionist

Since the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player, and the percussionist is to the left of the green person, the only possible positions for the saxophonist and the tennis player are:
- Saxophonist in house 1, Tennis player in house 2 (but this is already occupied by white).
- Saxophonist in house 2, Tennis player in house 3 (but this is already occupied by white).

Thus, the only possible positions are:
- Saxophonist in house 3, Tennis player in house 4.

This leaves the following:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: White
- House 3: Saxophonist, Tea drinker, Oranges
- House 4: Green, Pianist, Coffee drinker, or Percussionist

Since the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player, and the percussionist is to the left of the green person, the only possible positions are:
- Green in house 1, Pianist in house 2, Coffee drinker in house 3, Percussionist in house 4.

This leaves the pianist in house 2.

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
7. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.

From Clue 2, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. From Clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW).
2. The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in the first house (house 1).

From Clue 2, we know:
- The SF lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.

This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses. Since the CD is in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1. This leaves the romance book lover to be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the constraints:

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
2. The percussionist is in House 1, and the person with the radio is in House 2.
3. The pianist is in House 2 (since the percussionist is the only one left in House 1).
4. The person with the phone must be in House 1 (since the person with the radio is in House 2).

Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

Let's analyze these clues step by step:

- The second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.
- The person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3.
- The person who likes yellow must be in the house directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Given the above, let's test the possible positions:

- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, then the person who likes yellow must be in house 2 (since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan).
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, then the person who likes yellow must be in house 2 (since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan).

However, if the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, then the person who likes white must be in house 3 (since there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan). This would mean the person who likes yellow must be in house 2, which contradicts the condition that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

Therefore, the only consistent solution is:
- The person who owns a sedan is in house 3.
- The person who likes yellow is in house 2.

Thus, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

   - House 2: Loafers

   The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 2.

"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

We can deduce the following:
- The dog owner (D) must be in house 2 because the carnations arrangement (C) must be in house 1 (since house 1 is to the left of house 2).

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.

- From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2).
- From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

Since the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2 (the right house), so the person wearing sandals must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person eating grapes must also be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person eating grapes is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker cannot be in house 2).

From the above deductions:
- The person in house 1 is the tea drinker and is eating grapes.
- The person in house 1 is also wearing sandals.
- The person in house 2 must be the one wearing high heels.
- The person in house 2 must have a phone (since the person in house 1 has a television).
- The person in house 2 must be a water drinker (since the person in house 1 is a tea drinker).
- The person in house 2 must be eating kiwis (since the person in house 1 is eating grapes).

Therefore, the person eating kiwis lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist (Clue 1).
3. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives (Clue 2).
4. The violinist does not live in the third house (Clue 4).

Let's analyze the possible positions for the cellist and the guitarist:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the cellist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), so the violinist must be in either house 2 or house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 3 (Clue 2), but this would mean the cellist is in house 1, which is not possible since the cellist cannot be in house 3.
- Therefore, the violinist must be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2.

This leaves house 1 for the person who only drinks water, and house 3 for the guitarist.

Thus, the number of the house where the guitarist lives is 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the third house is occupied by someone who likes milk and is wearing sandals.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the sandals are in the third house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water (in the fourth house) must be to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 2, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the second house.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. The coffee drinker cannot be in the first or second house (since the first house is boots and the second house is running shoes). The coffee drinker must be in the third house (occupied by milk), and the person who is wearing loafers must be in the fifth house (occupied by tea).

Thus, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
   - The radio cannot be in house 4.

3. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who ate spaghetti is in house \( x \), the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house \( x-1 \).

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the television and phone must be in houses with the television to the left of the phone.

5. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - This means the gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.

6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - This means the grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

7. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the gameboy and computer must be in adjacent houses.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.
   - The computer cannot be in house 4.

Let's start by placing the pizza in house 4:
- House 4: Pizza

Since the radio cannot be in house 4, it must be in one of the other houses (1, 2, 3, or 5).

Let's try placing the computer in house 1:
- House 1: Computer
- House 4: Pizza

Since the computer and gameboy must be adjacent, the gameboy must be in house 2:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza

The computer and radio must be separated by one house, so the radio must be in house 3:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Gameboy
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

The grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house, so the grilled cheese must be in house 2:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

The grilled cheese and spaghetti must be adjacent, so the spaghetti must be in house 3:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Pizza

The phone and television must be in houses with the phone to the left of the television, so the phone must be in house 1 and the television in house 5:
- House 1: Phone
- House 2: Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Television

This configuration satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3.

Given the above deductions, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

From Clue 1, we deduce:
- The bird keeper must be in house 1 because the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2 (since the grilled cheese eater lives to the right of the bird keeper).
- Therefore, the bird keeper is in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The percussionist does not live in house 2, so the percussionist must live in house 1.

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in houses 1 and 2. Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2, the guitarist and the pizza eater must be in the remaining houses.

Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

3. **Clue 3**: The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
   - Golfer and truck driver cannot be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
   - Convertible driver: House 2, 3, or 4

5. **Clue 5**: The baseball player does not live in the third house.
   - Baseball player: House 1, 2, or 4

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 5, as the convertible driver cannot be in the third house.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
   - This means the sedan owner cannot be in the first house and must be in a house to the right of the baseball player.

8. **Clue 8**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - Since the bird keeper lives in house 3, the soccer player must live in house 1, 2, or 4.

9. **Clue 9**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in a house to the left of the soccer player.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- Bird keeper: House 3
- Cat lover: House 1, 2, or 4
- Golfers and truck drivers: Not adjacent
- Convertible driver: House 2, 3, or 4
- Baseball player: House 1, 2, or 4
- Sedan owner: House 2, 3, or 4 (to the right of the baseball player)
- Soccer player: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the bird keeper)
- Fish enthusiast: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the soccer player)

Given Clue 2, the bird keeper is in house 3. Let's place the other constraints:

- Convertible driver cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Baseball player cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so if the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 4. If the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 3 (but house 3 is taken by the bird keeper).

Let's try placing the convertible driver in house 1:
- Convertible driver in house 1
- Baseball player in house 2 (since they cannot be in house 3)
- Sedan owner in house 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper and house 4 for the sedan owner. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the sedan owner, house 2 for the fish enthusiast, and house 3 for the bird keeper.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the constraints and the need to deduce the correct house for the science fiction book fanatic, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 9 and Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses, respectively, or the third and first houses, respectively. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the second house (Clue 3), the flutist must be in the first house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the fish enthusiast and the person eating a banana. From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast must be to the right of the person eating a banana. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the first house.

The first house is occupied by the person eating a banana. The second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes (Clue 8).

Now, we need to place the pianist, the flutist, the fish enthusiast, the person eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes. The flutist is in the first house, and the fish enthusiast is in the third house. The pianist must be in the second house because the person eating a banana is in the first house and the person wearing running shoes is in the second house.

This leaves the cat lover in the first house, the person wearing loafers in the second house, and the person eating oranges in the third house. The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist, and the pianist is in the second house, so the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house.

The number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this clue is satisfied. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Kiwis

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the cat lover.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Person eating oranges
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we know:
- The mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2 (because house 2 is the only house to the right of house 1 and the only house where the person who had stew can be next to the mystery book reader).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.

This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes root beer.

Thus, the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - Phone: House 1, 2
   - Mangos: House 2, 3

   - Grapes: House 1, 2
   - Water: House 2, 3

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - Boots: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - Kiwis: House 1, 2
   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3
   - Boots must be in House 2 (since kiwis are in House 2)

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy. The person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

Since the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), and the person driving a convertible must be adjacent to the person eating mangos (Clue 6), the only possible positions for the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible are:
- House 1: Eating oranges (Clue 1)
- House 2: Driving a convertible (Clue 6)
- House 3: Owning horses (Clue 5)

Now, we need to place the bird keeper and the dog owner. From Clue 3, the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are 2 and 3, but house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses. Therefore, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 1. Given that house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3.

Thus, the only remaining house for the person driving a truck is house 2.

### Conclusion

The person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader. This implies the mystery book reader and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

2. **Clue 3**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the percussionist.

3. **Clue 4**: There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second or fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader.

5. **Clue 6**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. This means the flutist must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

6. **Clue 7**: The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the guitarist and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist.

7. **Clue 8**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater must be in adjacent houses, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

8. **Clue 9**: There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the history book buff must be in the house directly to the right or left of the mystery book reader.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the saxophonist:
- The saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, so he must be in the second or fourth house.
- The mystery book reader must be directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in the second house and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in the first or second house.

Given the saxophonist is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, the only possible positions for the percussionist are the third or fourth house. Let's check the third house:
- If the percussionist is in the third house, the guitarist must be in the second house, which is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house because the mystery book reader is there.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or second house, but the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Finally, let's place the history book buff:
- The history book buff must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the flutist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) 4."
"Based on the given clues and the logical deductions made, the person who is eating mangos lives in the fifth house (House 5).

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their attributes step by step:

1. **House 3: Green** (person who likes green)
2. **House 3: Radio** (person who has a radio)
3. **House 3: Computer** (person who has a computer, since it must be to the left of the phone)
4. **House 3: Phone** (person who has a phone, since it must be to the right of the gameboy)
5. **House 3: Gameboy** (person who has a gameboy, since it must be to the left of the phone)
6. **House 3: Television** (person who has a television, since it lives directly left of the person who likes red)
7. **House 2: Red** (person who likes red)
8. **House 2: Percussionist** (person who lives directly left of the person who likes white)
9. **House 3: White** (person who likes white)
10. **House 1: Guitarist** (person who lives directly next to the percussionist)
11. **House 1: Saxophonist** (remaining person, since the saxophonist must be in the remaining house, which is house 1)
12. **House 4: Cellist** (person who has a computer, since it cannot be in house 2)
13. **House 4: Television** (person who has a television, since it lives directly left of the person who likes red)
14. **House 5: Violinist** (person who has a violin, since it lives two houses away from the percussionist)

From the above deductions, the saxophonist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - The root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

From Clue 3, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1 and the guitarist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the arrangement is:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

The person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The correct option is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

- **Dog owner cannot be in house 2.**
- **Carnations arrangement must be to the right of the bird keeper.**
- **Vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner.**

Let's consider the possible placements:

### Case 1: Dog owner in house 1
- Bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- Bird keeper must be in house 2 or 3.
- If bird keeper is in house 2, carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
- Dog owner in house 1, bird keeper in house 2, carnations arrangement in house 3.
- Vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but this contradicts the placement of the carnations arrangement.

### Case 2: Dog owner in house 3
- Bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
- Bird keeper must be in house 1 or 2.
- If bird keeper is in house 1, carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
- Dog owner in house 3, bird keeper in house 1, carnations arrangement in house 2.
- Vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3), but this contradicts the placement of the carnations arrangement.

### Case 3: Dog owner in house 2
- Bird keeper cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1).
- Bird keeper must be in house 1 or 3.
- If bird keeper is in house 1, carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
- Dog owner in house 2, bird keeper in house 1, carnations arrangement in house 2.
- Vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

This scenario is consistent:
- Dog owner in house 2.
- Bird keeper in house 1.
- Carnations arrangement in house 2.
- Vase of tulips in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

Now, let's"
"Given the constraints and clues, let's deduce the correct house for the bird keeper step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating mangos.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This leaves house 3 and house 4 for the remaining two characteristics: bird keeper and person eating kiwis.

Since the person eating mangos is in house 1, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be adjacent. Given that house 2 is occupied by the dog owner, the bird keeper must be in house 3 and the person eating kiwis must be in house 4.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them as follows:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff, so they must be in adjacent houses (House 2 and House 3).
3. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house, so the bird keeper must live in the third house (House 3).
4. The romance book lover cannot live in the third house, so the romance book lover must live in the second house (House 2).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Bird keeper

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the constraints and clues provided, let's analyze the placement of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
   - This directly tells us that the coffee drinker lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 1 or 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.
   - This means the kiwi eater lives in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's combine these clues to determine the exact house for the coffee drinker:

- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the mangos eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 4.

- From Clue 2, the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, and the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker.
- From Clue 5, the apple eater must be to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's try to place the people based on these constraints:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

- From Clue 6, the flutist must be in house 1 and the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
- From Clue 5, the minivan must be in house 2, and the truck must be in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person with the gameboy must be in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the cellist must be in house 2 (but since the minivan is already in house 2, this is a contradiction unless we consider the minivan and cellist as being in adjacent houses, which is not possible with the given constraints).

Given the constraints, let's re-evaluate:

- The minivan must be in house 2, and the truck must be in house 1.
- The gameboy must be in house 3.
- The flutist must be in house 1.
- The person with the phone must be in house 1 (since the phone person is to the left of the minivan).

From Clue 12, the person who is eating oranges (house 4) is directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist is in house 5.

From Clue 2, the person who is eating mangos is to the right of the violinist.

- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.

From Clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From Clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From Clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From Clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

- Third house: Cellist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV (and also the person who likes white)

4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots.
- The second house is not occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies (Clue 1).
- The second house is not occupied by the person wearing high heels (Clue 2).
- The third house is the only remaining house, and it must be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels.

Since the first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots, the second house must be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels. This leaves the third house to be occupied by the person with the remaining flowers (roses) and the person wearing the remaining shoes (running shoes).

Therefore, the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and the need to deduce the correct arrangement, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The coffee drinker does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 2**: The root beer lover and the person wearing high heels are directly adjacent.
3. **Clue 3**: The basketball player and the tennis player are directly adjacent.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers are directly adjacent.
5. **Clue 5**: The tea drinker and the person who had pizza are directly adjacent.
6. **Clue 6**: The soccer player is to the right of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza is to the left of the cricketer.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who only drinks water is not in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who only drinks water is to the left of the tea drinker.
10. **Clue 10**: The person who only drinks water is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
11. **Clue 11**: The cricketer is to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
12. **Clue 12**: The root beer lover is to the left of the person who only drinks water.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.
14. **Clue 14**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

From Clue 13, the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, and the basketball player lives in the second house.

From Clue 14, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the tennis player cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the tennis player must be in the third or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the tea drinker and the person who had pizza are directly adjacent. Since the tennis player cannot be in the first house, the tea drinker and the person who had pizza must be in the second and third houses or the third and fourth houses.

From Clue 4, the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers are directly adjacent. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses.

From Clue 12, the root beer lover is to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the root beer lover cannot be in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second or third house. Given Clue 9, the person who only drinks water is to the left of the tea drinker, and the person who only drinks water is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This implies the person who only drinks water must be in the first house, the tea drinker in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese in the third house.

Given the constraints, the only possible arrangement that fits all the clues is:
- First house: Person who only drinks water
- Second house: Tea drinker, Person who ate spaghetti, Person who is wearing loafers, Person who is wearing boots
- Third house: Person who had pizza, Person who is wearing sandals, Person who only drinks water (already placed)
- Fourth house: Person who had stew, Person who is wearing high heels, Person who is wearing high heels (already placed)
- Fifth house: Person who had grilled cheese, Person who is wearing high heels (already placed)

Thus, the tea drinker lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following placements:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

- House 9: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 9)
- House 10: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 10)

Since the root beer lover cannot be in houses 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, the root beer lover must be in house 1 (Clue 11).

- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 6: Root beer lover

Now, let's place the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red (Clue 9).

- Since they live directly next to each other, they must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6.
- Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the yellow and red lovers must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6.

- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover

- House 2: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover
- House 8: Root beer lover
- House 9: Root beer lover
- House 10: Root beer lover

Next, let's place the person who likes white and the person who likes green (Clue 10).

- The person who likes white lives one house to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other (Clue 9).

Let's place the person who likes white in house 2 (Clue 10).

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 3: Spaghetti eater
- House 5: Yellow lover
- House 2: White lover
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover

- House 10: Root beer lover

Finally, let's place the person who likes green (Clue 13).

- The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who likes green.
- The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow (Clue 14).

Let's place the person who likes green in house 4 (Clue 13).

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 3: Spaghetti eater
- House 5: Yellow lover
- House 2: White lover
- House 4: Green lover
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover
- House 8: Root beer lover
- House 9: Root beer lover
- House 10: Root beer lover

Thus, the person who likes green lives in house 4.

From Clue 15"
"Given the clues and the constraints, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

### Initial Setup

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Let's denote the people in the houses as follows:
- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

### Clue 3 Analysis

Clue 3 states that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

### Clue 1 and Clue 2 Analysis

Clue 1 states that the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.

Clue 2 states that the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, then Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.
- If Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, then Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.

### Combining Clues

Let's combine the information from Clue 3 and Clue 1:

- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes (Clue 1).

This creates a contradiction because Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow and eat grapes simultaneously. Therefore, Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow.

Thus, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

Now, let's use Clue 1 again:
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) wears boots (Clue 2).

This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

Finally, we need to determine the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the remaining characteristics are:
- Person 1 (House 1) likes red.
- Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow.
- Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.
- Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

The only remaining characteristic is the fantasy book enthusiast. Since Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader, Person 1 (House 1) must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

### Conclusion

The fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 1."

- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: ?

From Clue 3, the violinist lives in the second house, so the violinist is in House 2.

Therefore, the cricketer must be in House 1, and the cellist must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the basketball player is in House 2. This leaves the soccer player to live in House 1 or House 3. But we already know the cricketer lives in House 1 and the cellist lives in House 3.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person wearing boots lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Boots

2. The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person wearing high heels must live in house 1.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots

3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Sedan

4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person who owns an SUV must live in house 1.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Sedan

5. The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Sedan

From the above deductions, we know:
- House 1: High Heels
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Sedan

Since the person wearing high heels lives in house 1, and the cat lover lives in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be the cat lover. This leaves the person wearing running shoes to live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - House 1: Kiwis
   - House 2: Blue

3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - Since the tea drinker lives in House 3, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in Houses 1 and 2. Given that House 1 already has kiwis, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in Houses 1 and 2. Since House 2 has blue, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 and the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Tulips

6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Boots

7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
   - The person who is eating oranges must live in either House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 already has kiwis, the person who is eating oranges must live in House 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Person who likes green
- House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other, and the only remaining house for the person who likes milk is House 3, the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people and their devices as follows:

1. The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB).
2. The mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P).
4. The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV).

From Clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as Mystery Reader (MR), History Book Buff (HBB), and Science Fiction Fanatic (SFF).

From Clue 1, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the history book buff must be in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the history book buff (HBB), which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Since the mystery book reader (MR) is in the first house, the history book buff (HBB) must be in the third house. This means the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: ?
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the person who has a computer (C). So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: TV
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 3, the person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P). Since the person with the computer is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. This means the person with the phone is the mystery book reader (MR). This is consistent with Clue 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB (history book buff)

The person who has a phone is the mystery book reader (MR), and the person who has a computer is in the second house. The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic (SFF), who must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

Pigs, like any other non-human animals, do not possess the cognitive abilities to understand or produce human languages such as pig Latin. However, it is not impossible to train pigs to perform certain tasks or respond to commands, which can be considered a form of communication. The concept of pig Latin, a playful way of altering words in English, relies on human linguistic understanding and manipulation, which pigs do not have."
"Given Ringo Starr's reputation for trying a wide variety of dishes and his adventurous culinary interests, it is unlikely that he would avoid a pot roast at a restaurant. Therefore, the answer is:

The 1936 Berlin Olympic Stadium, with a seating capacity of approximately 110,000, would be far too small to accommodate the typical Super Bowl crowd, which can range from over 70,000 to over 100,000 spectators. The venue was designed specifically for the 1936 Summer Olympics and would not meet the modern requirements for hosting such a large event."
"(A) No

Brown rockfish (Sebastes norvegicus) are not typically found in the waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis. These fish prefer colder waters in the North Atlantic, such as the Gulf of Maine and the northeastern United States. The waters around Saint Kitts and Nevis are more likely to support species adapted to the tropical and subtropical Caribbean environment."
"Growing seedless cucumbers might not be ideal for a gardener with entomophobia due to the potential presence of insects during the pollination process. Seedless cucumbers typically require pollination, which can involve bees and other insects. For a gardener with entomophobia, this could be distressing. Instead, focusing on growing regular cucumbers, which do not require pollination, might be more suitable. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"To determine if Martin Luther would run out of theses in half a year if he wrote one per day, we need to consider the number of days in half a year.

Half a year is equivalent to 182.5 days. If Martin Luther wrote one thesis per day, he would have written 182 theses in 182 days. On the 183rd day, he would have written his 183rd thesis.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"Given the lack of a clear definition for ""slam dance,"" it is challenging to definitively compare its potential for injury to that of a waltz. However, based on general knowledge:

- Waltz is typically a slow, graceful dance with low-impact movements.
- ""Slam dance"" could refer to various styles, but without a specific definition, it is difficult to determine its impact level.

Assuming ""slam dance"" refers to a more energetic or high-impact style, it is likely to be more injurious than a traditional waltz.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"
"No

A 1943-S penny is made of a copper-nickel alloy, not pure silver. Therefore, it would not be suitable for making silverware. Silverware is typically made from sterling silver (92.5% silver) or other high-quality silver alloys."

Snowboarding on Venus would be extremely difficult due to the planet's extreme conditions. Venus has a surface temperature of approximately 462°C (864°F) and a pressure that is about 92 times greater than Earth's at sea level. The atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it an inhospitable environment for snowboarding or any form of snow-related activity. The extreme heat, pressure, and corrosive nature of the atmosphere would make it impossible for snow to exist in a form suitable for snowboarding."
"The Battle of Tours, also known as the Battle of Poitiers, was fought in 732 between the Frankish forces led by Charles Martel and the Muslim forces led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. Charlemagne's father, Pepin the Short, was not involved in this battle. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"(A) No

Nissan's headquarters is located in Japan, and in Japan, the primary utensil used for eating is chopsticks. Therefore, workers at Nissan's headquarters in Japan would eat with chopsticks."
"No, Hermes is not equivalent to the Roman god Vulcan. Hermes is the Greek messenger god known for his wit, speed, and trickery, often associated with commerce, travel, and change. In contrast, Vulcan is the Roman god of fire, metalworking, and the forge. While both are associated with elements of fire and metalworking, they are distinct deities in their respective mythologies."

Cucumbers can vary in texture due to factors such as the variety, ripeness, and growing conditions. Some cucumbers are crisp and crunchy, while others may be softer and more watery. Therefore, not all cucumbers have the same texture."
"To determine if ""Rick and Morty"" could be triggered for children of alcoholics, we need to consider the nature of the show and the specific experiences of children of alcoholics. ""Rick and Morty"" often deals with complex and sometimes dark themes, including mental health issues, existential crises, and ethical dilemmas. However, it does not specifically address the unique challenges and emotional experiences of children who have grown up in households affected by alcoholism.

Children of alcoholics may be more sensitive to themes that directly relate to their personal experiences, such as family dysfunction, trauma, or the impact of parental substance abuse. While ""Rick and Morty"" may touch on some of these themes, it is not tailored to address the specific experiences of children of alcoholics.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"(A) No

Simon Cowell, as a television producer and judge, does not have the authority to vote for the next Supreme Court judge. The selection process for Supreme Court justices is governed by the U.S. Constitution and involves the President nominating a candidate, which then goes through a confirmation process in the U.S. Senate. Simon Cowell, being an individual without any official role in the judicial branch, cannot participate in this process."

"Yes, euphoria is often associated with drug addiction. This feeling can be a significant motivator for individuals to continue using drugs, as it can provide a sense of pleasure and relief from stress or other negative emotions. However, it's important to understand that euphoria is not unique to drug use and can be experienced through various means, including physical activity, social interactions, and certain mental states. In the context of addiction, the pursuit of this feeling can lead to compulsive drug use despite negative consequences."
"Given the context of Apollo from Greek mythology and D'Artagnan from Alexandre Dumas' ""The Three Musketeers,"" we need to consider their attributes and the nature of their fictional roles.

Apollo, as a god of prophecy, healing, and the sun, is typically depicted as a powerful and wise figure. However, his abilities are supernatural and not necessarily tied to physical combat prowess. In contrast, D'Artagnan is a musketeer known for his bravery, loyalty, and physical prowess, having been trained in swordsmanship.

Considering these attributes, it is reasonable to assume that D'Artagnan, with his training and experience, would be a formidable opponent. However, without knowing the exact abilities and powers of Apollo, it is difficult to definitively say whether he could defeat D'Artagnan.

Therefore, based on the information available, the most reasonable answer is:

(A) No"
"Given that Bob Marley died from advanced melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer, it is important to understand the role of sunscreen in relation to skin cancer.

However, once skin cancer has developed, sunscreen is not a treatment and does not help in curing the condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Yes"
"The French Defense is a chess opening that typically involves specific moves designed to control the center of the board and develop pieces. The four-move checkmate, which is a rare and specific sequence of moves, is not part of the standard French Defense strategy or moves. Therefore, the French Defense cannot be used to defend against a four-move checkmate. 

The correct answer is:

(B) No"
"Week-old chlorine-treated water is not safe to drink. Chlorine levels in treated water can decrease over time, and the water may become recontaminated. Additionally, chlorine can react with organic matter to form disinfection byproducts, which can be harmful. For safe drinking water, it is important to use and store water properly and to treat it with appropriate methods such as chlorination, filtration, or distillation, and to ensure that the water is consumed within a safe timeframe. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"A dichromat would likely have difficulty distinguishing between the colors of chlorine gas and neon gas. Chlorine gas appears greenish-yellow, and neon gas is bright red-orange. Since a dichromat has difficulty distinguishing between green and red, they would find it challenging to easily distinguish these two gases based on their colors. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"Elizabeth I of England lived from 1533 to 1603. The play ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" was written by Christopher Marlowe and first performed in 1587. Since Elizabeth I died in 1603, she would not have been alive to see the play performed during her reign. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"Avoiding internet trolls on Reddit is not entirely possible, but there are several strategies you can employ to minimize their impact:

1. **Ignore and Report**: Trolls often seek attention, so ignoring their posts and reporting them to Reddit can help reduce their visibility and influence.
2. **Use Filters and Subreddit Settings**: Some subreddits have filters or settings that can help reduce the number of troll posts you see.
3. **Stay Alert and Vigilant**: Be aware of the signs of troll behavior and be prepared to take action if necessary.
4. **Engage with Respect**: Sometimes, engaging with trolls in a respectful manner can help defuse the situation, but this is not always effective and can sometimes escalate the situation.
5. **Use Moderators**: If a troll is causing significant disruption, you can flag the post or the user to the subreddit's moderators, who can take action.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question ""Can you avoid internet trolls on Reddit?"" is:

(A) Yes"
"(A) No

Sea turtles are marine reptiles that do not experience quarantine in the same way humans do.

Therefore, sea turtles are not enjoying life during quarantine."
"(B) No

Jesus, as a central figure in Christianity, lived in the 1st century CE, during a time when the concept of the Easter Bunny did not exist. The Easter Bunny is a modern figure associated with Easter celebrations, which began centuries after Jesus' time. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Jesus would have any familiarity or understanding of the Easter Bunny."
"(A) No

An elephant is significantly larger and more powerful than a male macaque. Elephants can weigh up to 12,000 pounds and stand up to 13 feet tall, while a male macaque typically weighs between 10 to 20 pounds. Elephants have tusks and a much stronger bite force, making them capable of easily defeating a male macaque in a fight."

"A: (A) No

The Confederate States of America did not speak Old English before the Civil War. Old English was spoken by Anglo-Saxon settlers in England from the 5th to the 7th centuries. The English spoken in the Confederate States was a form of Modern English that evolved from Middle English, which itself developed from Old English. Therefore, the Confederate States did not speak Old English."

"Given Jack Kerouac's well-documented heavy drinking habits and the context of his lifestyle, it is highly unlikely that ethanol was beneficial to his health. His chronic alcohol consumption likely contributed to various health issues, including liver problems and other alcohol-related health complications. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"
"A: (A) No

The most expensive color in the world is not blue. While ultramarine, a deep blue pigment, is considered one of the most expensive due to its production process, which involves grinding lapis lazuli, the term ""most expensive color"" is often used more broadly to describe the high cost of certain shades or types of blue, such as ultramarine. However, the most expensive color in the world, in a more general sense, is often cited as red, specifically scarlet or carmine, which is derived from the cochineal insect."
"(B) No

Ryan Crouser, as a professional athlete specializing in shot put and javelin throw, possesses exceptional upper body strength and throwing skills. However, a bengal fox is a small wild animal weighing typically between 5 to 15 pounds (2.3 to 6.8 kg) and standing about 15 to 20 inches (38 to 51 cm) tall at the shoulder. Given the size difference, it is highly unlikely that Ryan Crouser could throw a bengal fox with ease, as the animal would be far beyond his reach and beyond the scope of his athletic abilities. Moreover, it would be unethical and illegal to attempt to throw a wild animal."
"Given the context of Lord Voldemort's rule and the strict measures he would likely impose, it is plausible that he could have set a rule that he himself would be barred from Hogwarts. Therefore, the answer is:

The Jackson 5 was indeed a bigger family band than The Isley Brothers. The Jackson 5 consisted of five members (Michael, Jermaine, Tito, Marlon, and Jackie Jackson), while The Isley Brothers had four members (O'Kelly, Ronald, Ernie, and Rudolph Isley). Additionally, the Jackson 5's broader influence and success, including hits like ""ABC"" and ""I Want You Back,"" further solidify their status as a larger and more prominent family band."

To make pickles, lactobacillus is indeed crucial. This beneficial bacteria plays a key role in the fermentation process, converting sugars into lactic acid and contributing to the characteristic sour flavor of pickles. Without lactobacillus, the pickling process would not proceed effectively, and the final product would lack its distinctive taste and preservation qualities."
"The Wall Street Crash of 1929 primarily affected traditional industries and stocks, such as those in manufacturing, finance, and real estate.

"Yes, a person with Anorexia Nervosa would be more likely to break a bone than a regular person. This increased risk is due to several factors:

1. **Low Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Individuals with Anorexia Nervosa often have a significantly lower BMI, which can lead to reduced bone density and weaker bones.
2. **Malnutrition**: The disorder often involves severe calorie restriction, leading to inadequate intake of essential nutrients, particularly calcium and vitamin D, which are crucial for bone health.
3. **Hormonal Imbalances**: Anorexia Nervosa can disrupt normal hormonal functions, including those related to bone formation and maintenance.
4. **Physical Activity**: Many individuals with Anorexia Nervosa engage in excessive exercise, which can further contribute to bone weakening.

Given these factors, a person with Anorexia Nervosa is at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis and subsequently breaking bones. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Yes"

Parsley is a versatile herb that is often used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Its widespread use and popularity make it a common ingredient in many households, which is why you might find it in various sections of a grocery store. Fresh parsley is typically found in the produce section, while dried parsley is usually located in the spice aisle. Some stores may also have a dedicated section for fresh herbs and spices, further contributing to its visibility across different store areas. Therefore, it is normal to find parsley in multiple sections of a grocery store."

"Given the attributes of Iris and Hermes, we can analyze their suitability for a UPS job:

Iris, as the messenger of the gods, is known for her swift and direct communication, which aligns well with the need for efficient package delivery and communication in a UPS job. However, her role is more focused on speed and communication rather than the detailed and repetitive tasks required in inventory management and customer service.

Hermes, the god of trade, commerce, and thievery, is resourceful and quick, which could be beneficial in handling packages and ensuring timely delivery. However, his playful and sometimes mischievous nature might not be ideal for the more structured and routine aspects of a UPS job, such as inventory management and customer service.

Considering these points, Hermes might struggle with the more mundane and detail-oriented tasks required in a UPS job, while Iris would excel in the speed and communication aspects.

Therefore, the answer is:

"The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed assassination attempt against King James I of England. Mary, Queen of Scots, was a Catholic and had been exiled from Scotland and imprisoned in England since 1568. She was executed in 1587 by King James I, who was also her cousin. Therefore, the Gunpowder Plot did not directly eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline. Mary's bloodline continued through her daughter, Elizabeth of Knole, who was born in 1585 and died in 1586. 

So, the correct answer is:

(A) No"

"To determine whether a bull shark bite hurts worse than a crocodile bite, we need to consider several factors, including the size and strength of the animals, the nature of their bites, and the potential for infection and tissue damage.

Bull sharks are known for their aggressive behavior and are capable of delivering powerful bites. They are found in various coastal and river environments, which increases the likelihood of encounters with humans. Bull shark bites can be severe due to their powerful jaws and the potential for causing significant tissue damage, infection, and other complications.

Crocodiles, while also capable of delivering powerful bites, are generally more selective about their prey. They are less likely to attack humans unless provoked or threatened. The severity of a crocodile bite can vary depending on the species and the size of the crocodile. However, crocodile bites can still cause significant pain and injury.

Given these factors, it is difficult to definitively say that one bite is definitely worse than the other. Both bull shark and crocodile bites can be serious and painful. The severity of the injury would depend on various factors such as the size of the animal, the force of the bite, and the individual's response to the injury.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"

In the context of the fairy tale ""Snow White,"" Snow White is not an example of good consent. The story depicts a situation where Snow White is forced to leave her parents' castle by the Queen, who is seeking to eliminate her. This scenario does not reflect a situation where consent is given voluntarily and freely. Consent is a crucial element in ethical and legal contexts, requiring clear, voluntary, and informed agreement. In the fairy tale, Snow White's actions are not a result of her own consent but rather a result of being forced to leave by her parents and stepmother."
"(B) No

Avengers Comics would not be out of place in a DC Comics store. Both Marvel and DC Comics are major players in the comic book industry, and their characters often appear in crossover events and shared universes.

"Given Brooke Shields' well-known public profile and her achievements in acting and modeling, it is less likely that she would have succeeded at the University of Pennsylvania in the traditional sense of academic achievement. However, her success at Penn would not necessarily be measured by her academic performance alone.

The University of Pennsylvania is known for its rigorous academic standards and diverse student body, which might present challenges for someone not accustomed to such academic rigor.

A cattle farmer could be useful to a drum maker in several ways, leveraging their expertise and resources:

1. **Raw Materials**: Cattle farmers can provide leather, which is a critical component in drum making. Leather from cattle is commonly used for drum heads, drum skins, and other parts of the drum.

2. **Labor**: If the cattle farmer has a team of workers, they could potentially help with tasks related to the production of drums, such as preparing the leather, cutting, and assembling the drum components.

3. **Networking**: The cattle farmer might have a network of suppliers or contacts that could be beneficial for sourcing materials or finding other resources needed for drum making.

These connections and resources can support the drum maker's business, making the cattle farmer a useful partner."

"To determine if it is socially acceptable to wear an icon depicting crucifixion, we need to consider the context in which this icon is being used. Social acceptability can vary widely depending on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs.

1. **Religious Context**: In many Christian cultures, wearing a crucifix is a common and socially acceptable practice, often seen as a symbol of faith and devotion.
2. **Secular Context**: In secular settings, such as workplaces, public schools, or in many secular countries, wearing religious symbols like a crucifix might not be socially acceptable due to the principle of separation of church and state or the need for inclusivity.

Given these considerations, the answer to whether it is socially acceptable to wear an icon depicting crucifixion depends on the specific context:

(A) Yes - If the context is a religious setting or a personal religious practice where such symbols are accepted.

(B) No - If the context is a secular setting or a public space where religious symbols are generally not accepted.

"Given the complexity of the question and the speculative nature of the inquiry, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the context and the factors that influenced Christopher Reeve's survival and recovery, we can consider the following:

1. **Access to Medical Care**: Wealth can provide access to better medical facilities, treatments, and specialists, which were crucial for Christopher Reeve's survival and recovery.

2. **Quality of Life**: Wealth can also improve the quality of life by providing better support services, assistive technology, and home health care, which are essential for managing a condition like paralysis.

3. **Research and Development**: Wealth can fund research and development, which can lead to new treatments and technologies that might have been available to him if he had been better off financially.

Considering these factors, while poverty could have made it more challenging for Christopher Reeve to access the necessary care and support, it's not a definitive answer to whether he would have lived. Therefore, the most accurate response is:

"To determine if binary numbers and the standard alphabet can satisfy the criteria for a strong password, we need to consider the typical requirements for a strong password:

1. **Length**: A strong password should be at least 8 characters long.
2. **Character Variety**: A strong password should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Given these criteria:

- **Binary Numbers (0 and 1)**: These can only be used to represent digits, which limits the character variety.
- **Standard Alphabet (Letters a-z and A-Z)**: This includes both uppercase and lowercase letters, adding variety to the password.

Since binary numbers alone do not provide the necessary variety of characters (only digits), and the standard alphabet alone does not meet the length requirement, a password that is solely based on binary numbers and the standard alphabet would not be considered strong.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"

"To determine if Bill Nye voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we need to consider the timeline of their lives and the voting age in the United States.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was the 32nd President of the United States, serving from 1933 to 1945. Bill Nye the Science Guy, whose real name is Bill Nye, was born on May 26, 1955. This means Bill Nye was not yet born when FDR was in office.

In the United States, the minimum age to vote is 18. Since Bill Nye was born in 1955, he would have turned 18 in 1973. Therefore, he could not have voted for FDR, who was president from 1933 to 1945.

Thus, the correct answer is:
(B) No"

Guitarists often develop calluses on their fingertips due to the repetitive pressure from playing the guitar. These calluses can provide a protective layer and reduce the sensation of pain from the strings. However, the ability to handle pain is a general physiological trait and is not directly related to the presence of calluses. Calluses do not increase the threshold for pain; they merely reduce the sensitivity to the roughness of the strings. Therefore, a guitarist's fingers are not inherently better at handling pain than the average person."
"Given Kami Rita's extensive experience in mountaineering, including summits of high peaks like Mount Everest, it would not be difficult for him to climb Mount Emei.

However, Kami Rita's expertise and experience would likely make the climb manageable for him. Therefore, the answer is:

(A) No"
"No, Roman numerals cannot fill the normal number of Sudoku box options. In Sudoku, each box must contain the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once. Roman numerals, however, only include the symbols I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, which do not correspond to the numbers 1 through 9. Therefore, using Roman numerals would not allow for the complete set of required numbers in each box, making it impossible to solve a Sudoku puzzle with Roman numerals."

"The crash of United Airlines Flight 232 on July 19, 1989, is widely considered one of the worst in aviation history. While United Airlines was not directly responsible for the crash, the company faced significant criticism and scrutiny for its handling of the situation. The airline's management and leadership were heavily criticized for their response to the crisis, including their decision to land the aircraft at Sioux City Regional Airport rather than the nearest airport, which was 100 miles away. This decision was later found to have been made in a rush, without proper consultation with the pilots, and it contributed to the severity of the crash.

United Airlines also faced significant financial and operational challenges as a result of the incident, and its reputation was damaged. The crash highlighted issues with the airline's safety culture and management practices, leading to a thorough investigation and changes in the company's policies and procedures.

Therefore, United Airlines was not blameless in the aftermath and the broader context of the incident. The correct answer to the question ""Was United Airlines blameless in the worst crash in history?"" is:

"To determine if a 1996 leap year baby would technically be 1 year old in 2000, we need to consider the nature of leap years and how age is calculated.

1. **1996 was a leap year**, which means February 1996 had 29 days.
2. **Age calculation**: A person's age is determined by the number of years that have passed since their birth, not by the specific day of the year.
3. **1997 was not a leap year**, so February 1997 had 28 days.
4. **2000 was a leap year**, which means February 2000 had 29 days.

Given these points:
- In 1997, the person would have missed their birthday, so they would not be considered 1 year old.
- In 2000, the person would have their birthday on February 29, making them 3 years old, not 4.

"To determine whether raw carrots are better for maximizing vitamin A intake, it's important to consider the bioavailability of vitamin A in different forms. Vitamin A in carrots is primarily in the form of beta-carotene, which the body can convert into retinol (active vitamin A). Cooking carrots can enhance the release of beta-carotene, making it more accessible to the body.

However, raw carrots are still a good source of vitamin A. The body can absorb some vitamin A from raw carrots, but the process is less efficient compared to cooked carrots. Cooking can break down cell walls, making the beta-carotene more readily available for absorption.

Therefore, while raw carrots are nutritious, they may not be the best choice for maximizing vitamin A intake due to the lower bioavailability of the vitamin in its raw form.

An armadillo's shell is indeed a strong and protective feature, but it is not suitable as a shield for humans for several practical reasons:

1. **Size and Weight**: The shell of an armadillo is relatively small and lightweight, making it impractical for a human to use as a shield.
2. **Mobility**: Armadillos are not designed to move quickly or maneuver in complex ways, which would be necessary for effective use as a shield.
3. **Durability**: While the shell is tough, it can be damaged or broken, leaving the user exposed.
4. **Versatility**: A human would need a shield that can be used in various situations, such as in a fight or confrontation, and an armadillo's shell is not versatile enough for these purposes.

Therefore, an armadillo's shell cannot be used as a shield for a human."

"During the pandemic, door-to-door advertising can be considered inconsiderate due to the following reasons:

1. **Health Risks**: Door-to-door canvassing involves close contact with individuals, which can increase the risk of spreading the virus, especially among those at higher risk due to age or pre-existing health conditions.

2. **Social Distancing**: The practice of door-to-door canvassing often involves standing close to people's homes, which goes against the social distancing guidelines recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.

1. **Cost of Running for President of India:**
   - The cost of running for President of India can vary widely. It typically includes campaign expenses, legal fees, security costs, and administrative expenses. In India, the cost can range from a few million to tens of millions of Indian Rupees (INR) or more, depending on the candidate's resources and the scale of the campaign.

"The Jungle Book, written by Rudyard Kipling, does contain elements that can be interpreted as having racist subtext. The portrayal of British colonials and the native characters, particularly the ""Mowgli"" character, has been subject to critical analysis. The paternalistic attitude towards the British and the sometimes stereotypical depiction of the native characters, such as the ""Hathi the Elephant,"" can be seen as problematic. These elements reflect the racial dynamics and attitudes of the time when the book was written. Therefore, the correct answer to the question ""Does The Jungle Book contain racist subtext?"" is:

A cheetah, with its exceptional speed and agility, can indeed run at high speeds, but its physical capabilities are not sufficient to topple a professional wrestler like Big Show. The force required to move a person of Big Show's size and build is far beyond what a cheetah can generate, even in its peak sprinting condition. Additionally, the size and muscle mass of a professional wrestler like Big Show make it impossible for a cheetah to exert enough force to cause such a significant movement."

Tenzing Norgay, despite his extensive mountaineering experience, would still face significant challenges on Snowdon Mountain. While he was a renowned climber who scaled Mount Everest, the altitude and weather conditions of Snowdon Mountain present unique difficulties. Climbing to 1,085 meters (3,560 feet) above sea level involves dealing with high altitude, which can affect physical and mental capabilities. Additionally, the mountain's weather can be unpredictable, with sudden changes in temperature and weather conditions. Therefore, while Tenzing Norgay would likely find the climb manageable, it would still be a substantial challenge for him."
