"Let's think through this step by step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with the vase of tulips lives next to the guitarist.
3. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives next to the person with the carnations.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1, we know the flutist is in house 2.

From clue 4, the pianist must be in either house 3 or house 4. If the pianist is in house 3, the guitarist must be in house 2, but that's not possible because the flutist is already in house 2. So, the pianist must be in house 4.

Now, we have:
- Flutist in house 2
- Pianist in house 4

This leaves houses 1 and 3 for the other two people. From clue 3, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be next to the person with the carnations. So, they can't be in houses 1 and 3 together. That means the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 and the person with the carnations in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Bouquet of lilies
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Pianist

Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's figure out where the cellist lives step by step.

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house. So, the first house is green.
2. The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. They can't be in the same house, so they must be in the second and third houses.
3. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
4. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
5. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
6. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

So, the first house is green, and the person who likes kiwis is in the first house. The second and third houses must have the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy. Since the cellist and the person who has a gameboy must be one house apart, and the percussionist can't be in the second house, the cellist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the cellist lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes kiwis lives in the fifth house.
3. The person who likes running shoes lives in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes bananas.
5. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
6. The person who likes sandals lives directly left of the person who likes bananas.
7. The person who likes blue lives directly right of the person who likes red.
8. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
9. The person who likes high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
10. The person who likes grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
11. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
12. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
13. The person who likes oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes bananas.
14. The person who likes blue lives directly right of the person who likes red.
15. The person who likes water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
16. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
18. The person who likes running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. The person who likes grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Now, let's fill in the houses:

- House 2: Red drinker
- House 5: Kiwi eater
- House 4: Running shoes wearer
- House 1: Sandals wearer (left of bananas)
- House 3: Blue drinker (right of red drinker)
- House 6: White lover (not in 3)
- House 7: Green lover (not in 3)
- House 8: Cricketer (not in 3)
- House 9: Water drinker (not in 3)
- House 10: High heels wearer (not in 3)

From the clues, we know:
- The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
- The person who likes white can live in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes white can live in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes white can live in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes white can live in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So, the person who likes white must live in house 1, 2, 4, or 5. But since the person who likes red is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1, 4, or 5.

Since the person who likes oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes bananas, and the person who likes red is in house 2, the person who likes oranges must be in house 1, 3, or 4.

Since the person who likes blue lives directly right of the person who likes red, the person who likes blue must be in house 3.

Since the person who likes white does not live in the third house, the person who likes white must be in house 1, 4, or 5.

Since the person who likes running shoes lives in the fourth house, the person who likes white must be in house 1, 4, or 5.

Since the person who likes grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes root beer lover, and the person who likes red is in house 2, the person who likes grapes must be in house 3, 4, or 5.

Since the person who likes high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer, and the person who likes cricketer must be in house 6, 7, 8, or 9, the person who likes high heels must be in house 7, 8, or 9.

Since the person who likes water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, and the person who likes tea drinker must be in house 6, 7, 8, or 9, the person who likes water must be in house 8, 9, or 10.

Since the person who likes green must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes root beer lover, and the person who likes root beer lover must be in house 1, 2, 3, or 4, the person who likes green must be in house 5.

So, the person who likes green lives in house 5.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step again, like I'm explaining it to a primary school student.

We have 4 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know some things about what each person likes or wears:

1. One person drinks root beer, one drinks tea, one drinks coffee, and one drinks water.
2. One person eats apples, one eats oranges, one eats mangos, and one eats grapes.
3. One person eats grilled cheese, one eats spaghetti, one eats fried rice, and one has pizza for lunch.
4. One person wears high heels, one wears running shoes, one wears loafers, and one wears sandals.
5. One person drives an SUV, one drives a truck, one drives a minivan, and one drives a convertible.

We also have some clues that help us figure out where each person lives:

1. The person who drives a truck lives next to the person who owns an SUV.
2. The person who wears loafers lives next to the person who drives a convertible.
3. The person who wears high heels lives in the third house.
4. The person who eats grapes lives next to the coffee drinker.
5. The person who wears running shoes lives next to the person who eats spaghetti.
6. The person who drives a truck lives next to the person who eats fried rice.
7. The person who drives a truck lives next to the tea drinker.
8. The coffee drinker lives next to the person who wears running shoes.
9. The person who eats apples lives in the first house.
10. The person who has pizza lives next to the coffee drinker.
11. The root beer lover lives next to the person who wears running shoes.
12. The person who has pizza and the person who eats mangos live next to each other.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives:

- The person who wears high heels lives in the third house. So, house 3 is the third house.
- The person who eats apples lives in the first house. So, house 1 is the first house.
- The person who wears running shoes lives next to the person who eats spaghetti. Since the person who eats apples is in house 1, the person who eats spaghetti must be in house 2 or 4.
- The person who eats grapes lives next to the coffee drinker. So, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 or 4.
- The person who wears running shoes lives next to the person who eats spaghetti. So, if the person who eats spaghetti is in house 2, the person who wears running shoes must be in house 1 (but house 1 is for apples). So, the person who eats spaghetti must be in house 4, and the person who wears running shoes must be in house 2.
- The person who drives a truck lives next to the person who eats fried rice. So, the person who eats fried rice must be in house 2 or 4. Since the person who eats spaghetti is in house 4, the person who eats fried rice must be in house 2.
- The person who drives a truck lives next to the tea drinker. So, the tea drinker must be in house 1 or 4. Since the person who eats apples is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 4.
- The coffee drinker lives next to the person who wears running shoes. So, the coffee drinker must be in house 4.
- The person who has pizza lives next to the coffee drinker. So, the person who has pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who wears high heels
- House 2: Person who eats spaghetti, wears running shoes, and has pizza
- House 3: Person who eats mangos
- House 4: Person who eats grapes, wears loafers, and has pizza

Therefore, the tea drinker lives in house 4.

The correct answer is **(C) 4**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We know:
1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. So, the fifth house is taken by the person who only drinks water.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. So, the third house is taken by the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 7, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. Since the third house is taken by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in the first and second houses. But the person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so the person who had stew must be in the first house and the person who likes milk must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who only drinks water

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with clue 4.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

The answer is (A) 5."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. Each house has a different person living in it, and each person plays a different sport, eats a different fruit, and has different flowers in their foyer.
3. The clues are:
   - The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

Now, let's think about the houses and the people:

- The soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2 because the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges.
- The person with daffodils must be to the right of the person eating oranges, so the person with daffodils must be in house 2.
- The swimmer and the person with daffodils live next to each other, so the swimmer must be in house 1.
- The person with tulips must be to the right of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1 because the swimmer is in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person with daffodils
- House 3: Person with tulips

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Violinist

2. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in either House 1 or House 3.

3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (where the violinist lives) and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2.

4. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person with a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3 (where the history book buff lives).

5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 3 (where the person who ate fried rice lives).

6. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
   - This means the person with a radio must be in either House 2 or House 3, and the history book buff must be in either House 3 or House 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, the history book buff must be in House 3).

7. The violinist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Violinist

8. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person with a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3 (where the history book buff lives).

9. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone must be in House 2 and House 3 or House 3 and House 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone must be in House 2 and House 3).

Given these constraints, let's figure out the positions:

- Violinist in House 1
- History book buff in House 3
- Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone are in House 2 and House 3

Since the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone must be next to each other and the history book buff is in House 3, the person with a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

So, the person with a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step again, like I'm explaining it to a primary school student.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know what each person has and what they like:

1. One person has a gameboy.
2. One person has a phone.
3. One person has a computer.
4. One person has carnations.
5. One person has a bouquet of lilies.
6. One person has roses.
7. One person plays the flute.
8. One person plays the cello.
9. One person plays the percussion.
10. One person has horses.
11. One person has birds.
12. One person has fish.
13. One person likes history books.
14. One person likes romance books.
15. One person likes mystery books.

We also have some clues:

1. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

Now, let's put the clues together:

- The mystery book reader lives in the second house. So, the second house is:
  - Mystery book reader

- The bird keeper does not live in the first or third house. So, the bird keeper must live in the third house. So, the third house is:
  - Bird keeper

- The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house. So, the fish enthusiast must live in the first house. So, the first house is:
  - Fish enthusiast

- The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in the first house, the bouquet of lilies must be in the second house. So, the second house is:
  - History book buff
  - Bouquet of lilies

- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the computer must be in the third house. So, the third house is:
  - Percussionist
  - Computer

- The gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in the first house, the rose bouquet must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is the history book buff. So, the rose bouquet must be in the third house. So, the third house is:
  - Gameboy
  - Rose bouquet

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who owns horses lives in house 3.
2. The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live next to each other.
3. The person who owns horses lives in house 3.
4. The dog owner lives next to the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. The person who owns horses lives next to the person who has a radio.
6. The person who has a gameboy lives next to the person who has a rose bouquet.
7. The person who is eating apples lives next to the cat lover.
8. The person who owns horses lives next to the person who is eating grapes.
9. The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live next to each other.
10. The person who is eating bananas lives one house away from the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. The person who is eating apples lives one house away from the person who is eating oranges.
12. The person who is eating bananas lives two houses away from the person who is eating oranges.
13. The person who is eating bananas lives two houses away from the person who is eating grapes.
14. The person who has a computer does not live in house 5.

Let's start by placing the person who owns horses in house 3.

- House 3: Horses

Now, the person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be next to each other. Let's try placing them in houses 2 and 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Carnations

Next, the dog owner lives next to the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Let's try placing the dog owner in house 1.

- House 1: Dog
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Carnations

Now, the person who is eating apples lives next to the cat lover. Let's try placing the cat lover in house 5.

- House 1: Dog
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Carnations
- House 5: Cat Lover

The person who is eating apples must live next to the cat lover. Let's try placing the person who is eating apples in house 4.

- House 1: Dog
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Apples
- House 5: Cat Lover

Now, the person who is eating bananas lives one house away from the person who has a carnations arrangement. Let's try placing the person who is eating bananas in house 2.

- House 1: Dog
- House 2: Bananas
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Apples
- House 5: Cat Lover

The person who is eating bananas lives two houses away from the person who is eating oranges. Let's try placing the person who is eating oranges in house 5.

- House 1: Dog
- House 2: Bananas
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Apples
- House 5: Oranges

The person who is eating bananas lives two houses away from the person who is eating grapes. Let's try placing the person who is eating grapes in house 4.

- House 1: Dog
- House 2: Bananas
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Grapes
- House 5: Oranges

Finally, the person who has a computer does not live in house 5. Let's try placing the person who has a computer in house 1.

- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Bananas
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Grapes
- House 5: Oranges

So, the person who has a phone must live in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have two houses, house 1 and house 2.
2. In house 1, there's a person wearing sandals and a person driving a convertible.
3. In house 2, there's a person wearing boots and a person driving a truck.
4. The person wearing boots does not live in house 1.

From clue 1, the person driving a convertible must be next to the person who likes history books. So, if the person in house 1 is driving a convertible, the person in house 2 must be the history book buff. But the person in house 2 cannot be wearing boots, so the person in house 2 must be wearing boots and driving a truck.

This means the person in house 1 is the history book buff and is wearing sandals.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. The swimmer lives next to the romance book lover.
   - So, the romance book lover must be in House 2, and the swimmer is in House 1 (but we already know the golfer is in House 1, so this is a mix-up). Let's fix it:
   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (because the mystery book reader is next to the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

3. The basketball player is not in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

4. The mystery book reader is next to the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our findings.

So, the only house left for the basketball player is House 3.

The basketball player lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

1. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
2. The person wearing high heels does not live in the second or fourth house. So, they must live in the first or third house. But the third house is taken by the mystery book reader, so the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.
3. The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (second house) must be to the right of each other. This means the person wearing loafers must live in the fourth house.
4. The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses. The only houses left are the second and third. The person wearing sandals must live in the second house, and the romance book lover must live in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing high heels
- Second house: Person wearing sandals
- Third house: Mystery book reader
- Fourth house: Person wearing loafers

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

We have three houses, and each house has a person with a different device and a different favorite color. We know the following:

1. The person who likes green lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives next to the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house.

Let's try to figure out where each person lives:

- If the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, then the person who likes green must live in house 2 (because they are next to each other).
- If the person who likes green lives in house 2, then the person who has a gameboy must live in house 3 (because they are next to each other).
- If the person who has a gameboy lives in house 3, then the person who has a computer must live in house 2 (because they are next to each other).

But we know that the person who likes yellow can't be in house 2. So, the person who likes yellow must be in house 3.

If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (because they are next to each other).
And the person who has a computer must be in house 1 (because they are next to the person who has a gameboy).

So, the person who has a computer lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
5. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
6. The person who likes white lives two houses away from the coffee drinker.
7. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
8. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From clue 5, the root beer lover is in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From clue 6, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses. This means they can be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5 (but since there are only 4 houses, they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3).

From clue 7, the person who likes white lives two houses away from the coffee drinker. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the white person is in house 3, which is the root beer lover's house. So, the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1. If the coffee drinker is in house 2, the white person is in house 4. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the white person is in house 1, which is the root beer lover's house. So, the coffee drinker cannot be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 4, the white person is in house 2.

From clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means if the romance book lover is in house 1, the history book buff is in house 2. If the romance book lover is in house 2, the history book buff is in house 3. If the romance book lover is in house 3, the history book buff is in house 4. If the romance book lover is in house 4, the history book buff is in house 5 (but there is no house 5).

Let's try the possible placements:

- If the romance book lover is in house 1, the history book buff is in house 2. The root beer lover is in house 3, and the tea drinker cannot be in house 2, so the tea drinker must be in house 4. The coffee drinker must be in house 1, but that's already taken by the romance book lover. So, this is not possible.
- If the romance book lover is in house 2, the history book buff is in house 3. The root beer lover is in house 3, which is not possible.
- If the romance book lover is in house 3, the history book buff is in house 4. The root beer lover is in house 3, which is not possible.
- If the romance book lover is in house 4, the history book buff is in house 5 (but there is no house 5).

So, the only possible placement is:
- Romance book lover in house 1, history book buff in house 2.
- Root beer lover in house 3.
- Tea drinker in house 4.
- Coffee drinker in house 2.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have two houses, house 1 and house 2.
2. In house 1, we know:
   - The fantasy book enthusiast lives there.
   - The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - The person who had pizza does not live there.
3. In house 2, we know:
   - The fish enthusiast lives there.
   - The person who has a radio lives there.
   - The person who ate spaghetti lives there.
   - The person who likes green lives there.
4. The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

Now, let's figure out who lives where:

- Since the person who likes green lives in house 2 and is directly left of the person who has a radio, the person who has a radio must be in house 1.
- The person who had pizza cannot be in house 1, so the person who had pizza must be in house 2.
- The person who likes green is in house 2, so the person who has a radio must be in house 1.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

1. The fish enthusiast lives next to the cellist.
2. The person eating kiwis lives next to the guitarist.
3. There is one house between where the person eating apples lives and where the person eating oranges lives.
4. The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live next to each other.
5. The flutist lives in the first house.
6. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.

8. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
9. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
10. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other.
11. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.
12. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.
13. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 8, we know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis.

From clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the flutist.

From clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 11, the person eating oranges does not live in the second house. So, the person eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. So, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 7, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house. So, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2 or 4.

From clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the flutist, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person eating oranges
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 11, the person eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From clue 12, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2 or 4.

Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the flutist, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

So, the person eating kiwis must live in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who had stew lives in.

We have 5 houses, and we need to figure out the arrangement based on the clues given. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.
6. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start by putting the grilled cheese and pizza together because they are directly next to each other (Clue 6 and Clue 4).

So, we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Pizza

Now, grilled cheese and stew are next to each other (Clue 4), so:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Stew

Next, grilled cheese and tulips are next to each other (Clue 8), so:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Tulips

But we know grilled cheese and pizza are together (Clue 6), so:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Pizza

Now, grilled cheese and spaghetti are next to each other (Clue 7), so:
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Grilled cheese

But we already have grilled cheese in house 1, so:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Spaghetti

Now, grilled cheese and tulips are next to each other (Clue 8), so:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Tulips

But we already have grilled cheese in house 1, so:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Tulips

Now, oranges and apples are next to each other (Clue 2), and oranges are to the right of apples (Clue 10), so:
- House 3: Oranges
- House 4: Apples

There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives (Clue 9), so:
- House 2: Kiwis

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house (Clue 5), so:
- House 5: Daffodils

The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos (Clue 11), so:
- House 3: Apples
- House 4: Mangos

So, the person who had stew lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the primary school level education persona.

1. We know the cat lover lives in house 1.
2. The tulip owner lives next to the dog owner.
3. The daffodils owner doesn't live in house 2.
4. There's one house between the horse owner and the carnations owner.
5. The lilies owner lives to the right of the horse owner.

Let's fill in the houses one by one:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Daffodils (because the daffodils owner can't be in house 2)
- House 3: Horse (because there's one house between the horse and the carnations)
- House 4: Dog (because the tulip owner is next to the dog)
- House 5: Fish (the only pet left)

So, the fish enthusiast lives in house 5.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person in house 1 has a phone (Clue 1).
2. The person in house 2 does not wear boots (Clue 2).
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other (Clue 3).

From Clue 1, we know house 1 has a phone. So, house 2 does not have a phone.

From Clue 2, house 2 does not wear boots. So, house 2 must wear high heels.

From Clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since house 1 has a phone, house 1 must have horses (because house 1 can't have a phone and house 2 can't have horses).

So, house 1 has horses and house 2 has a radio. Since house 2 does not wear boots, house 2 must wear high heels.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. We have six people with different characteristics: sandals, boots, loafers, blue, green, yellow; apples, grapes, mangos; grilled cheese, pizza, fried rice; computer, phone, radio.

From the clues:
- Grilled cheese and computer live next to each other.
- Grilled cheese does not live in house 3.
- Apples do not live in house 1.
- Apples live next to boots.
- There is one house between blue and phone.
- Loafers and computer live next to each other.
- Pizza does not live in house 2.
- Mangos live next to yellow.
- Computer and phone live next to each other.

Let's figure out the houses step by step:

1. Since grilled cheese and computer live next to each other and grilled cheese does not live in house 3, grilled cheese must live in house 1 and computer in house 2.
2. Apples do not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2 or 3. But since grilled cheese is in house 1, apples must live in house 3.
3. Since apples live in house 3, boots must live in house 2 (because apples and boots are next to each other).
4. There is one house between blue and phone. Since blue must be in house 1 (because grilled cheese is in house 1), phone must be in house 3.
5. Since phone is in house 3, blue must be in house 1.
6. Loafers and computer live next to each other, and computer is in house 2, so loafers must be in house 1 (but house 1 is already taken by blue).
7. Since loafers cannot be in house 1, they must be in house 3.
8. Since phone is in house 3, yellow must be in house 2 (because mangos and yellow are next to each other).
9. This leaves green for house 1.

So, the person who likes green lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have 4 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the sports and pets each person has, but we need to figure out which house each person lives in.

Here are the clues again:
1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives.

1. The baseball player lives in the second house. So, we have:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Baseball player
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. The basketball player does not live in the first house, so they can be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. But since the baseball player is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 3 or House 4.

3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. So, if the basketball player is in House 3, the swimmer must be in House 4. If the basketball player is in House 4, the swimmer must be in House 3. But we already know the baseball player is in House 2, so the basketball player must be in House 3 and the swimmer in House 4.

4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. So, if the dog owner is in House 3, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4. If the dog owner is in House 4, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3. But we already know the baseball player is in House 2, so the dog owner must be in House 3 and the fish enthusiast in House 4.

5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house, so they can be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. But since the baseball player is in House 2, the bird keeper must be in House 3 or House 4.

6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. So, if the tennis player is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 4. If the tennis player is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 3. But we already know the baseball player is in House 2, so the tennis player must be in House 3 and the cat lover in House 4.

7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house. So, the bird keeper must be in House 1 or House 4. But since the baseball player is in House 2 and the fish enthusiast is in House 4, the bird keeper must be in House 1.

So, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"Let's figure out where the soccer player lives step by step using the clues given.

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.

- The baseball player is in house 2.
- The person who likes blue is in house 3.

From clue 3, we know:
- The sedan and SUV owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 4, we know:
- The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
- This means the SUV must be in house 1 and the sedan in house 2.

From clue 5, we know:
- The violinist does not live in the first house.
- This means the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.

From clue 6, we know:
- The person who owns a sedan (house 2) and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
- This means the gameboy must be in house 1.

From clue 7, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
- The white lover must be in house 1 or 3.

Since the gameboy is in house 1, the white lover must be in house 3 (because the white lover cannot be in house 1).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Sedan
- House 3: Person who likes blue

The remaining characteristics:
- The white lover is in house 3.
- The guitar is in house 3.
- The gameboy is in house 1.
- The violinist is in house 2.
- The baseball player is in house 2.
- The soccer player is in house 1.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the primary school level education persona.

We have 3 houses in a row, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following about the people:

1. One is a pianist, one is a violinist, and one is a percussionist.
2. One is wearing running shoes, one is wearing high heels, and one is wearing boots.
3. One is eating oranges, one is eating a banana, and one is eating kiwis.

6. The person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.
7. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.

Let's try to figure out where each person lives based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Deduction

1. **Pianist** cannot be in house 1.
2. **Pianist** and **person wearing high heels** are next to each other.
3. **Person eating oranges** and **person eating kiwis** are next to each other.
4. **Person eating kiwis** is to the left of **person wearing boots**.
5. **Person wearing high heels** and **person with a radio** are next to each other.
6. **Person eating oranges** is directly left of **person with a television**.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- **Person eating oranges (O)** and **Person eating kiwis (K)** are next to each other.
- **Person eating kiwis (K)** is to the left of **Person wearing boots (B)**.
- **Person wearing high heels (H)** and **Person with a radio (R)** are next to each other.
- **Person eating oranges (O)** is directly left of **Person with a television (T)**.

Let's try placing the remaining people:

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

### Verification

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

- **Pianist (P) is in house 1**.

- **Pianist (P) and person wearing high heels (H) are next to each other**.
- **Person eating oranges (O) is in house 4**.
- **Person eating kiwis (K) is in house 5**.
- **Person eating kiwis (K) is to the left of person wearing boots (B)**.
- **Person wearing high heels (H) and person with a radio (R) are next to each other**.

All clues are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."
"Let's go through the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

1. The tea drinker does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
3. The person who likes red does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
5. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
6. There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
8. The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
9. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
10. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
11. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
12. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the milk drinker.

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples also lives in the third house. This contradicts clue 7, so there must be a mistake. Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house instead.

Now, the third house is occupied by the milk drinker, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who is eating apples.

From clue 1, the tea drinker does not live in the first house. So, the tea drinker can live in the second, third, or fourth house. But since the third house is occupied by the milk drinker, the tea drinker must live in the second or fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. So, the person who likes red can live in the first, second, or fourth house. But since the third house is occupied by the milk drinker, the person who likes red can live in the first or fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the third house.

From clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the fourth house, the root beer lover must be in the first or second house. But the second house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana, so the root beer lover must be in the first house.

From clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fourth, fifth, or fifth house. But the fourth house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana, so the person who owns an SUV must be in the fifth house.

From clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the second house, the person who likes red must be in the first house.

From clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in the first house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the second house.

From clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a truck is in the fifth house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

From clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who is eating mangos is in the fourth house, the person who likes green must be in the fifth house.

From clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the fourth house.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. Each person has a different kind of car and is eating a different kind of fruit. We know some clues about where each person lives and what they eat.

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who eats a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who eats kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house. So, the first house is for the person who eats kiwis.

From clue 4, the person who eats a banana does not live in the second house. So, the person who eats a banana must live in the third house.

This means the second house is for the person who eats mangos.

Now, we know the first house is for the person who eats kiwis, and the third house is for the person who eats a banana. So, the second house must be for the person who eats mangos.

From clue 3, the person who drives a truck does not live in the first house (where the person who eats kiwis lives) and does not live in the third house (where the person who eats a banana lives). So, the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

This leaves the first house for the person who owns an SUV.

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly next to the person who ate fried rice, so the spaghetti eater must be in the second house.
3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
4. The cricketer doesn't live in the third house, which is correct since the third house is for fried rice.

So, the houses are:
- First house: swimmer
- Second house: spaghetti eater
- Third house: fried rice eater

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

9. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
10. There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
11. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's fill in the houses step by step:

- House 5: Blue
- House 4: White
- House 3: Green
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 1: SUV (since it cannot be in the first house)
- House 6: (Not given yet)

Now, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Now, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Finally, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

The person who is wearing boots must live somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck. Given the constraints, the only possible position for boots is in House 1.

So, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is **(A) 1**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

1. We know the history book buff lives in the first house. So, the first house is for the history book buff.
2. The person who had stew lives in the third house because there is one house between the history book buff and the person who had stew.
3. The person who had pizza lives in the second house because there is one house between the person who had pizza and the person who had stew.

So, the history book buff lives in house number 1.

- House 1: Soccer player
- House 3: Person who is eating kiwis
- House 2: Not apples eater
- House 4: Not oranges eater
- House 5: Not science fiction book fanatic

From clue 11, the fried rice eater and the swimmer live next to each other. So, if the swimmer is in house 2, the fried rice eater must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who is eating kiwis. So, the swimmer must be in house 3, and the fried rice eater must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fried rice eater
- House 3: Person who is eating kiwis
- House 4: Not oranges eater
- House 5: Not science fiction book fanatic

From clue 6, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. So, the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 12, the cellist and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. So, if the person who is eating grapes is in house 4, the cellist must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who is eating kiwis. So, the person who is eating grapes must be in house 5, and the cellist must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fried rice eater
- House 3: Person who is eating kiwis
- House 4: Cellist
- House 5: Not science fiction book fanatic

From clue 10, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. So, the person who is eating apples must be in a house to the left of the flutist.

From clue 13, the cellist and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. So, the person who is eating grapes must be in house 5, and the cellist must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fried rice eater
- House 3: Person who is eating kiwis
- House 4: Cellist
- House 5: Not science fiction book fanatic

From clue 10, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. So, the person who is eating apples must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who is eating apples
- House 2: Fried rice eater
- House 3: Person who is eating kiwis
- House 4: Cellist
- House 5: Not science fiction book fanatic

The person who is eating apples lives in house 1.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it.
2. Each person has different flowers, favorite colors, shoes, and likes different kinds of books.
3. We have some clues to figure out where each person lives.

Here are the clues again:
1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Now, let's figure out where each person lives:

- From clue 7, the person who has daffodils lives in the second house. So, House 2 has daffodils.
- From clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house. So, House 3 has loafers.
- From clue 3, the history book buff lives in the second house. So, House 2 has the history book buff.
- From clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in the third house. So, the person who likes yellow must live in either House 1 or House 3. But since House 3 has loafers, the person who likes yellow must live in House 1.
- From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since House 3 has loafers, the person who likes blue must live in House 1 or House 2. But since House 1 has yellow, the person who likes blue must live in House 2.
- From clue 5, the person who has lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since House 2 has daffodils and House 1 has yellow, the person who has lilies must live in House 3. So, House 3 has the person who has lilies.
- From clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since House 1 has yellow and House 3 has lilies, the person who is wearing boots must live in House 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Yellow (loves yellow, has yellow flowers, wears boots)
- House 2: Blue (loves blue, has daffodils, wears high heels)
- House 3: Green (loves green, has lilies, wears high heels)

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

We know the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. So, the first house is taken by the person with running shoes.

The person who owns a sedan can't be in the third house. So, the person who owns a sedan can be in the second, fourth, or fifth house.

The person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who wears high heels. The person who wears running shoes and the person who wears boots live next to each other.

The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's put it together:

1. First house: Running shoes
2. Fourth house: SUV

This leaves us with the second, third, and fifth houses for the remaining people.

Since the person who owns a sedan can't be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan and the person who wears high heels must be next to each other, we can try different combinations.

If the person who wears sandals is in the second house, then the person who drives a convertible must be in the fifth house. This leaves the third house for the person who drives a minivan and the person who wears high heels.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Running shoes
- Second house: Sandals
- Third house: Minivan, High heels
- Fourth house: SUV
- Fifth house: Convertible

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. The cricketer lives in the first house. So, house 1 is for the cricketer.
2. The horse owner lives next to the sedan owner. This means the horse owner and the sedan owner can't be in adjacent houses.
3. The cat lover lives next to the horse owner. So, the cat lover and the horse owner can't be in adjacent houses either.
4. The truck driver lives next to the basketball player. So, the truck driver and the basketball player can't be in adjacent houses.

Let's try to fit everyone into the houses:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: (S, C, H, T)
- House 3: (S, C, H, T)

Since the cricketer is in house 1, the sedan owner (S) and the horse owner (H) must be in houses 2 and 3. The cat lover (C) must be in a house adjacent to the sedan owner (S) or the horse owner (H).

Let's try house 2 for the sedan owner (S) and house 3 for the horse owner (H):

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Sedan owner (S)
- House 3: Horse owner (H)

Now, the cat lover (C) must be in house 2 or house 3. Since the cat lover (C) can't be in house 2 (because the sedan owner is there), the cat lover (C) must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Sedan owner (S)
- House 3: Cat lover (C)

Since the truck driver (T) lives in house 3, the basketball player (B) must live in house 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person with the vase of tulips lives in.

From the clues, we can see that the person with the vase of tulips must be in the fifth house because the fifth house is where the guitar lives, and the vase of tulips is to the right of the saxophonist (fourth house) and the bouquet of daffodils (second house).

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in **House 5**.

The correct answer is (C) 5."

The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house (Clue 9).

Now, let's use clue 4. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1 (because the pizza eater is to the right of the running shoes person).

From clue 1, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the running shoes person is in house 1, the sandals person must be in house 2 (because the sandals person is to the left of the milk person).

Now, clue 5 tells us the cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the cellist must be in house 3.

Clue 6 tells us the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the sandals person is in house 2, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3.

From clue 10, the basketball player must be to the right of the tennis player. So, if the tennis player is in house 1, the basketball player must be in house 2 or 3. If the tennis player is in house 2, the basketball player must be in house 3. If the tennis player is in house 3, the basketball player must be in house 4, but house 4 is taken by the minivan driver.

So, the tennis player must be in house 1, and the basketball player must be in house 2.

Now, the root beer lover is in house 3, and the minivan driver is in house 4.

The swimmer and the sedan owner must be next to each other, and the swimmer cannot be in house 1. So, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner must be in house 3.

5. There is one house between the flutist and the person eating bananas.
6. The person with a vase of tulips lives next to the person with a radio.
7. The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 2. So, house 2 is taken.

From clue 1, the person with a television lives next to the tea drinker. Since house 2 is taken, the person with a television must be in house 1, and the tea drinker must be in house 3.

From clue 4, the person with a television lives next to the guitarist. Since the person with a television is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 3.

From clue 5, there is one house between the flutist and the person eating bananas. Since the person eating bananas must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker is in house 3), the flutist must be in house 2. But house 2 is taken by the person with a rose bouquet, so this doesn't work. Let's try another arrangement.

Since the person with a television is in house 1 and the guitarist is in house 3, the person eating bananas must be in house 2. This means the flutist must be in house 1, but house 1 is taken by the person with a television. So, let's try another arrangement.

From clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips lives next to the person with a radio. Since the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 1, and the person with a radio must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with a radio, eating bananas, and having a vase of tulips.
- House 2: Person with a rose bouquet.
- House 3: Person with a television, guitarist, and eating kiwis.

The root beer lover must live in house 1 because that's the only house left.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 1. The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
3. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
6. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
7. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must live somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the science fiction book fanatic can live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples does not live in the third house. So, the person who is eating apples can live in the first or the second house.

From clue 5, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means the mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

From clue 3, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means the apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

From clue 6, there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing boots must be in houses 2 and 4 or 1 and 3.

From clue 8, the person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person who is eating a banana can live in the fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together:
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic (from clue 2)
- First or second house: Person eating apples (from clue 4 and clue 6)
- Second or first house: Person eating mangos (from clue 5 and clue 3)
- Fourth house: Person eating a banana (from clue 8)

Since the person eating apples cannot be in the third house (clue 4) and the person eating mangos must be directly left of the person wearing sandals (clue 5), the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person eating mangos must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: Person eating apples
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

2. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
3. The person who owns a sedan cannot be in house 1 because the person who only drinks water is not in house 1.
4. So, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3.
5. But house 3 is already taken by the root beer lover, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.
6. The person who owns a sedan must be in house 1.
7. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

5. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not white

6. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the person wearing sandals and the person with a gameboy must be in adjacent houses, but the sandals must be to the left of the gameboy.

7. There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4 or 4 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 2 and 4).

8. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not stew

9. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the cat lover must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Grilled cheese

11. The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.

12. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
    - House 2: High heels

13. The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.

18. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.

- House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew
- House 4: Blue, loafers, not white
- House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew
- House 6: Not white, not red, not stew

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The correct answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people who live there:

1. The person who has lilies doesn't live in the first house.
2. The person who has a TV lives in the first house.

So, the first house can't have lilies. That means the person in the first house must have the computer because there's only one computer and one TV.

Since the first house has the TV, the second house must have the computer.

So, the person who has the computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
   - This means the golfer is in the right house, and the science fiction book fanatic is in the left house.

2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - This means pizza-eater and history book buff are in adjacent houses.

3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the guitarist and the person with daffodils are in adjacent houses, and the guitarist is to the right of the person with daffodils.

Now, let's put these clues together:

- Since the golfer is in the right house (House 2), the science fiction book fanatic must be in the left house (House 1).
- The pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in House 1 and House 2.
- The guitarist and the person with daffodils must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist is to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the golfer is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person with daffodils must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic, Person with daffodils
- House 2: Pizza-eater, Golfer, Person with bouquet of tulips, Guitarist

The percussionist must be in the house where the person with the bouquet of tulips lives, which is House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **2**.

"Let's figure out where the percussionist lives step by step:

1. The violinist lives in house 4.
2. The dog owner is not in house 2.
3. The fish enthusiast and the horse owner are next to each other.
4. The flutist is next to the TV owner.
5. The TV owner is next to the radio owner.
6. The guitarist is next to the percussionist.
7. The gameboy owner is next to the TV owner.
8. The phone owner is between the horse owner and the TV owner.
9. The bird keeper is in house 5.

Let's place the bird keeper in house 5 first:
- House 5: Bird keeper

Now, the phone owner must be between the horse owner and the TV owner. Let's try placing the horse owner and TV owner:
- House 4: Violinist
- House 3: TV owner
- House 2: Phone owner
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 5: Bird keeper

Now, the fish enthusiast and the horse owner are next to each other. The horse owner is in house 3, so the fish enthusiast must be in house 2:
- House 2: Phone owner
- House 3: TV owner
- House 4: Violinist
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 5: Bird keeper

The flutist is next to the TV owner, so the flutist must be in house 4:
- House 2: Phone owner
- House 3: TV owner
- House 4: Violinist, Flutist
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 5: Bird keeper

The gameboy owner is next to the TV owner, so the gameboy owner must be in house 3:
- House 2: Phone owner
- House 3: TV owner, Gameboy owner
- House 4: Violinist, Flutist
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 5: Bird keeper

The guitarist is next to the percussionist. The flutist is in house 4, so the percussionist must be in house 3:
- House 2: Phone owner
- House 3: TV owner, Gameboy owner, Percussionist
- House 4: Violinist, Flutist
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 5: Bird keeper

So, the percussionist lives in house 3.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the violinist lives.

1. The person with a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples.
2. The person with a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. So, house 1 is:
- Lilies

From clue 4, the basketball player does not live in house 1, so the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at clue 1 and clue 2 together. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist. Since the basketball player is in house 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1. So, house 1 is:
- Lilies
- Apples

This leaves house 2 for the violinist. So, the violinist lives in house 2.

The number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The tennis player lives in the 3rd house.

5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Now, let's fill in the houses:

- House 3: Tennis player
- House 5: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Golfer

Since there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who ate spaghetti, and the fried rice person must be to the left of the spaghetti person, the only possible positions are:
- Fried rice in House 1
- Spaghetti in House 2

So, we have:
- House 1: Fried rice
- House 2: Spaghetti

Now, the person who had pizza must be to the left of the cricketer. The only house left for the pizza person is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 2.

So, the cricketer lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing loafers lives.

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. So, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in the first house and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the baseball player must live in the first house.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water, Person who likes white
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (already in house 1), Person who ate spaghetti, Person who likes red, Person who plays baseball, Person who wears loafers

From the clues, we know the person who only drinks water lives in house 1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2. The person who likes white lives in house 1. The person who likes red lives in house 2. The person who plays baseball lives in house 1. The person who wears loafers must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

"Let's think about the houses and the people living in them step by step.

We have three houses: House 1, House 2, and House 3. Each house has a different person living in it, and each person is eating a different fruit and drinking a different drink.

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the root beer lover lives.

First, let's list the possible positions for the root beer lover:
- The root beer lover cannot be in House 2 (Clue 3).
- The root beer lover cannot be in House 1 because the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1 (Clue 4).

So, the root beer lover must be in House 3.

Now, let's check if this fits all the clues:
- If the root beer lover is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 1 (Clue 2).
- The coffee drinker must be in House 2 (Clue 1).

So, the arrangement would be:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Root beer lover

This arrangement fits all the clues:
- The coffee drinker (in House 2) is to the left of the person eating mangos (in House 3).
- The person who only drinks water (in House 1) is to the right of the root beer lover (in House 3).
- The root beer lover is not in House 2.
- The person eating oranges is not in House 2.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. So, the first house is for the spaghetti eater.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. So, the loafers wearer can't be in House 1.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. So, the fried rice eater can't be in House 2.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. So, if the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Boots wearer
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

Now, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Boots wearer
- House 3: Fried rice eater

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in.

1. The dog owner lives in house 3.
2. The root beer lover lives in house 5.
3. The person wearing sandals does not live in house 2.
4. The coffee drinker and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other.
5. The person with running shoes and the bird keeper live next to each other.
6. There is one house between the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person with the bouquet of lilies.
7. There is one house between the person with horses and the person with the bouquet of lilies.
8. The person with carnations arrangement lives next to the bird keeper.
9. The bird keeper lives next to the person with loafers.
10. The person with the vase of tulips lives next to the dog owner.
11. There are two houses between the person who only drinks water and the person who wears boots.
12. The person who only drinks water lives next to the person who likes milk.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the house numbers:

- House 3: Dog owner
- House 5: Root beer lover
- House 2: Not sandals (so it could be coffee drinker, rose bouquet, running shoes, or bird keeper)
- House 1: Water drinker and milk drinker (next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the person with boots)
- House 4: Horses
- House 1: Water drinker and milk drinker (since they are next to each other and there are two houses between them and the person with boots, the only place left for the water drinker and milk drinker is house 1)
- House 2: Running shoes and bird keeper (since they live next to each other and house 1 is taken by water drinker and milk drinker)
- House 4: Horses
- House 1: Water drinker and milk drinker
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 5: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes and bird keeper
- House 4: Horses
- House 1: Water drinker and milk drinker

From the clues, we can see that the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4 because there is one house between the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person with the bouquet of lilies, and the person with horses is in house 4.

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has a mystery book reader.
   
2. The tennis player doesn't live in the first house.
   - So, the tennis player must live in the second house.
   
3. The fantasy book enthusiast and the golfer (the person who plays golf) must live in the first and second houses, but we already know the first house has the mystery book reader.
   - Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with a different characteristic.
2. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
4. The person who likes white lives in one of the houses 1, 2, or 3.
5. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
6. The person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist.
8. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
9. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
10. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
11. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
12. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
13. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.

From clue 13, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is house number 4.

From clue 6, the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So, if the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 2, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1. But this would mean the person who likes white is in house 3, which is not possible because the person who likes white must be to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2. This means the person who likes white must be in house 4, but house 4 is already taken by the person who is wearing loafers.

Therefore, the person who likes white must be in house 3.

The number of the house where the person who likes white lives is 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The cellist lives in the first house.
2. The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

From clue 1, we know the cellist lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the golfer cannot be in the fourth house.
From clue 3, the violinist cannot be in the fourth house.
From clue 4, the person who is wearing high heels cannot be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the basketball player is somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
From clue 6, the flutist is somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
From clue 7, the flutist is somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
From clue 8, the basketball player is somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
From clue 9, the person who likes yellow is directly left of the person who likes milk.
From clue 10, the flutist is somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
From clue 11, the person who likes blue is somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
From clue 12, the person who only drinks water is somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's try to fit these clues together:

- Cellist is in House 1.
- Flutist must be somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots and to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, Flutist can be in House 2, 3, or 4.
- Basketball player is somewhere to the left of the person who likes red and to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. So, Basketball player can be in House 2, 3, or 4.
- Flutist is somewhere to the right of the cricketer. So, Cricketer can be in House 1 or 2.
- Person who likes yellow is directly left of the person who likes milk. So, Yellow and Milk must be in consecutive houses.
- Person who only drinks water is somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. So, Water and Coffee must be in consecutive houses.

Let's try placing the flutist in House 2 (since it's the middle and can fit the clues):
- Flutist in House 2.
- Cricketer must be in House 1 (since Flutist is to the right of Cricketer).
- Basketball player must be in House 3 or 4 (since Basketball player is to the right of running shoes and to the left of red).
- If Basketball player is in House 3, then Red must be in House 4 (since Basketball player is to the left of red).
- If Red is in House 4, then Yellow must be in House 3 (since Yellow is directly left of Milk).
- If Yellow is in House 3, then Milk must be in House 4.
- If Milk is in House 4, then Water must be in House 1 (since Water is to the left of Coffee).
- If Water is in House 1, then Coffee must be in House 2 (since Coffee is to the right of Water).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Water
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Basketball player
- House 4: Red

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes red lives.

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes red lives in house number 1.

From clue 7, the person who is eating grapes also lives in house number 1.

From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1, the cricketer must live in house number 2.

From clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1, the person who likes white must live in house number 2.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the person who has a computer lives in house number 3, the person who had pizza must live in house number 2.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer lives in house number 3, the person who has a radio must live in house number 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who likes red, person who is eating grapes.
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese, person who likes white, person who had pizza, person who has a radio, person who is a cricketer.
- House 3: Person who has a computer, person who is a soccer player.

From clue 5, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the person who is eating apples must live in house number 1, the soccer player must live in house number 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who is wearing boots lives in the third house (House 3).
2. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house (House 1).
3. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
5. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
6. The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
8. The person who is wearing boots lives in the third house (House 3).
9. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house (House 1).
10. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
12. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
13. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house (House 1).
14. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
15. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
16. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
17. The person who is wearing boots lives in the third house (House 3).
18. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house (House 1).

From the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 3: Boots
- House 2: Rose bouquet (since it's directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement)
- House 4: Not gameboy (since the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy)
- House 5: Tennis player (since the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 2: Rose bouquet
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 3: Boots
- House 4: Not gameboy
- House 5: Tennis player

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. So, the first house has someone eating kiwis.
2. The person wearing high heels and the bird keeper live next to each other. Since the first house has someone eating kiwis, the bird keeper can't be in the first house. So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.
3. The tennis player and the person eating apples live next to each other. Since the first house has someone eating kiwis, the tennis player can't be in the first house. So, the tennis player must be in the second house.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house. So, the second house has someone reading science fiction books.
5. The dog owner does not live in the first house. So, the dog owner must be in the second house.

Now we know:
- First house: Eating kiwis (we don't know who exactly)
- Second house: Dog owner, eating apples, reading science fiction books, wearing high heels, and playing cricket (the cricketer)

So, the cricketer lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person eating grapes lives. We know the following from the clues:

1. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
2. The pizza lives in the fifth house.
3. The grilled cheese and pizza live next to each other.
4. The cat lover lives next to the fish enthusiast.
5. Fried rice is not in the first house.
6. The cricketer lives to the right of the swimmer.
7. The person eating oranges lives in the second house.
8. The person eating oranges lives to the right of the person eating mangos.
9. The person eating oranges lives in the second house.
10. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
11. The bird keeper lives to the right of the person eating apples.
12. The swimmer lives in the second house.
13. The pizza lives in the fifth house.
14. There is one house between the dog owner and the person eating kiwis.

From clue 1, 2, and 13, we know:
- Pizza lives in the fifth house.
- Grilled cheese and pizza live next to each other, so grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
- Fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
- Swimmer lives in the second house.
- Oranges live in the second house.
- Fried rice is not in the first house.
- Cricketer lives to the right of the swimmer, so cricketer lives in the third or fourth house.
- Bird keeper lives to the right of the person eating apples.

From clue 11, we know:
- Bird keeper lives to the right of the person eating apples.

From clue 14, we know:
- There is one house between the dog owner and the person eating kiwis.

Let's fill in the houses step by step:
- House 1: Fried rice (since it can't be in the first house and we have to place something)
- House 2: Oranges (clue 9 and 12)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (clue 10)
- House 4: Grilled cheese (clue 1 and 13)
- House 5: Pizza (clue 13)

Now we need to place the rest:
- House 1: Fried rice
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Pizza

The remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We know:
- Cricketer lives to the right of the swimmer (clue 7), so cricketer lives in the third or fourth house.
- Swimmer lives in the second house.
- Bird keeper lives to the right of the person eating apples (clue 11).

So, the only place left for the person eating apples is the first house, and the person eating kiwis must be in the fourth house (one house between the dog owner and the person eating kiwis).

So, the person eating kiwis lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person who had pizza lives.

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house. So, the first house is for green.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue. So, if we put blue in the second house, pizza must be in the first house.
3. But we already know the first house is for green, so pizza can't be in the first house. This means blue must be in the first house and pizza in the second house.
4. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. So, if we put carnations in the third house, red must be in the fourth house.
5. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house. So, the third house can be for red or carnations.
6. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red. So, if we put mangos in the second house, red must be in the third house.
7. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. So, if we put lilies in the fourth house, truck must be in the third house.
8. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. So, if we put minivan in the third house, spaghetti must be in the fourth house.
9. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza. So, if we put pizza in the second house, mangos must be in the first house.
10. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. So, if we put grapes in the fourth house, red must be in the first house.
11. The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. So, if we put rose bouquet in the third house, pizza must be in the second house.
12. The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other. So, if we put SUV in the fourth house, blue must be in the first house.
13. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. So, if we put apples in the third house, pizza must be in the second house.

From all these clues, we can see that the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person eating grapes lives in the second house.
2. The person driving a convertible also lives in the second house.
3. So, the person eating mangos must live in the first house.

So, the person eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. The people are eating different fruits and have different favorite colors.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes blue is to the left of the person who likes kiwis.
4. The person who likes blue is in house 2.
5. So, the person who likes kiwis must be in house 1 because the person who likes blue is to the left of the person who likes kiwis.
6. The person who likes green must be in house 1 because the person who likes blue is in house 2 and the person who likes kiwis is in house 1.
7. The person who likes white must be in house 3 because the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes blue is in house 2.
8. The person who likes apples is in house 1, and the person who likes oranges is in house 3.

So, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the rose bouquet lives.

1. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader and the gameboy are in house 2. So, house 2 must have the mystery book reader and the gameboy.

From clue 2, the soccer player is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2. So, house 1 must have the soccer player.

Now, we know house 1 has the soccer player and the gameboy, and house 2 has the mystery book reader and the gameboy. The root beer lover must be in house 2 because the root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We have 4 houses, and each house has a different person living in it.
2. Each person has a different pet: cat lover, fish enthusiast, horse owner, and dog owner.
3. Each person has a different car: sedan, SUV, minivan, and truck.
4. We have some clues to figure out where the dog owner lives.

### Clues:
1. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.

### Let's figure out the dog owner's house:

1. **Clue 4**: The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. This means if the fish enthusiast is in house 1, the dog owner is in house 2. If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the dog owner is in house 3. If the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the dog owner is in house 4. If the fish enthusiast is in house 4, the dog owner is in house 1.
   
2. **Clue 5**: The cat lover does not live in the second house. So, the cat lover can only be in house 1, 2, 3, or 4, but not in house 2.

3. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives. This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in the first or last house. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means if the fish enthusiast is in house 1, the minivan is in house 2 or 3 or 4. If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the minivan is in house 3 or 4. If the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the minivan is in house 4. If the fish enthusiast is in house 4, the minivan is in house 1 or 2.

Let's try to fit all these clues together:

- If the fish enthusiast is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2. But the cat lover cannot be in house 2, so the cat lover must be in house 1, which is a contradiction.
- If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the dog owner must be in house 3. The truck must be in house 1 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner, and the truck must be left of the sedan). The sedan must be in house 4. The minivan must be in house 3 (since the minivan is to the right of the fish enthusiast, and the fish enthusiast is in house 2). This fits all the clues.
- If the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the dog owner must be in house 4. But the cat lover cannot be in house 2, so this doesn't work.
- If the fish enthusiast is in house 4, the dog owner must be in house 1. But the cat lover cannot be in house 2, so this doesn't work.

So, the only fitting solution is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the third house is yellow.
2. The person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3. So, blue can be in the fourth house.
3. The person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3. So, milk can be in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water. So, white can be in the fourth house.
5. The person who likes root beer is in the second house. So, the second house is root beer.

So, the only house left for the person who likes blue is the fourth house.

The number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is 4.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the primary school level education.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following about the people:

1. One person is wearing boots, one is wearing sandals, and one is wearing loafers.
2. One person has a cat, one has a dog, and one has a bird.
3. One person likes green, one likes blue, and one likes white.
4. One person eats oranges, one eats grapes, and one eats mangos.
5. One person plays basketball, one plays baseball, and one plays cricket.

We also have some clues:

1. The cricket player lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats oranges.
2. The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The person who eats grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. The person who wears sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. The person who wears loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats grapes.

Let's start with clue 6:
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house (house 2).

So, house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue.

Now, let's use clue 1:
- The cricket player lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats oranges.
- This means the cricket player is in house 3, and the person who eats oranges is in house 1.

So, house 1 is taken by the person who eats oranges, and house 3 is taken by the cricket player.

Next, clue 2:
- The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
- This means the baseball player is in house 1, and the cat lover is in house 3.

So, house 1 is taken by the baseball player, and house 3 is taken by the cricket player.

Now, clue 3:
- The person who eats grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
- This means the basketball player is in house 1, and the person who eats grapes is in house 3.

So, house 1 is taken by the baseball player, and house 3 is taken by the cricket player.

Next, clue 4:
- The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
- This means the dog owner is in house 1, and the person who likes green is in house 3.

So, house 1 is taken by the baseball player, and house 3 is taken by the cricket player.

Now, clue 5:
- The person who wears sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
- This means the person who wears sandals is in house 3, and the dog owner is in house 1.

So, house 1 is taken by the baseball player, and house 3 is taken by the cricket player.

Finally, clue 7:
- The person who wears loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats grapes.
- This means the person who eats grapes is in house 1, and the person who wears loafers is in house 3.

So, house 1 is taken by the baseball player, and house 3 is taken by the cricket player.

From all these clues, we can see that the person who likes white must be in house 1 because all other houses are taken by the other people.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

1. The dog owner lives in the fourth house.
2. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
3. The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.
4. The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the cellist lives in the fourth house.
5. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
6. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk, so the root beer lover lives in the first house and the person who likes milk lives in the second house.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.
8. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
10. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
11. The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
12. There is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives.
13. There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
14. The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.

From clue 1, the dog owner lives in the fourth house.
From clue 2, the cricketer lives in the fourth house.
From clue 3, the coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.
From clue 4, the cellist lives in the fourth house.
From clue 5, the cricketer lives in the fourth house.
From clue 6, the root beer lover lives in the first house and the person who likes milk lives in the second house.
From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.
From clue 8, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
From clue 10, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
From clue 11, the pianist lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
From clue 12, there is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives.
From clue 13, there are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
From clue 14, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.

Since the cricketer and the dog owner are in the fourth house, the tennis player must be in the third house to be directly left of the bird keeper.

So, the tennis player lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who likes blue lives in house 5.
2. The tennis player lives next to the person who eats kiwis.
3. The mystery book reader lives next to the person who eats oranges.
4. The cricketer lives next to the person who likes yellow.
5. The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.
6. The person who eats mangos does not live in house 4.
7. The swimmer lives next to the person who likes green.
8. There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives.
9. The person who eats a banana does not live in house 5.
10. There is one house between where the person who eats mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.
11. There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Let's start by placing the person who likes blue in house 5.

- House 5: Blue

Next, we need to place the tennis player and the person who eats kiwis. They must be next to each other.

- House 4: Tennis player
- House 3: Kiwis

Now, the cricketer must be next to the person who likes yellow.

- House 2: Cricketer
- House 1: Yellow

The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic must be next to each other.

- House 6: Golfer
- House 7: Science fiction book fanatic

The person who eats mangos cannot be in house 4, so they must be in house 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Cricketer
- House 3: Kiwis
- House 4: Tennis player
- House 5: Blue
- House 6: Golfer

The person who eats mangos must be in house 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since house 1 is already taken by yellow, the person who eats mangos must be in house 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Cricketer
- House 3: Kiwis
- House 4: Tennis player
- House 5: Blue
- House 6: Golfer

The person who eats oranges must be next to the mystery book reader.

- House 7: Oranges
- House 8: Mystery book reader

The person who eats a banana cannot be in house 5, so they must be in house 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Cricketer
- House 3: Kiwis
- House 4: Tennis player
- House 5: Blue
- House 6: Golfer

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

We have two houses, and we know:
- House 1 has a person who is a guitarist or a cellist.
- House 2 has a person who is a guitarist or a cellist.
- House 1 also has a person who has a computer or a gameboy.
- House 2 also has a person who has a computer or a gameboy.
- House 1 has a person who has a dog or a fish.

We also know:
1. The cellist lives next to the person with the gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

Let's list out the possibilities:

- If the cellist is in house 1, then the gameboy owner must be in house 2 (because they are neighbors and the cellist is to the left of the gameboy owner).
- If the cellist is in house 2, then the gameboy owner must be in house 1 (because they are neighbors and the cellist is to the left of the gameboy owner).

Since the dog owner cannot be in house 1, the only place for the dog owner is house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person with a gameboy lives in house 3.
2. The person with a minivan lives in house 1.
3. The person with a phone lives next to the person with an SUV, and the phone is to the left of the SUV.
4. The person with a radio lives in house 4.
5. The person with a convertible does not live in house 3.
6. The person with a computer does not live in house 1.

Now, let's fill in the houses:

- House 1: Minivan (from clue 2)
- House 3: Gameboy (from clue 1)
- House 4: Radio (from clue 4)

Since the person with a phone is next to the person with an SUV and the phone is to the left of the SUV, and house 4 is taken by the radio, the person with a phone must be in house 2. So, the person with an SUV must be in house 3, but house 3 is already taken by the gameboy. This means the person with an SUV must be in house 4.

So, the person with an SUV lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step, following the clues given:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
   - So, house 3 has tulips.

2. The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
   - So, house 2 has a computer.

3. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 3. But since house 2 already has a computer, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 4.

   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 4: Carnations arrangement

4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the daffodils and radio must be in houses 4 and 5, or 3 and 4, or 2 and 3, or 1 and 2, or 1 and 3. Since house 3 already has tulips and house 4 has daffodils, the only possible pair is houses 2 and 5.

   - House 2: Computer
   - House 5: Daffodils

5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the lilies and phone must be in houses 3 and 4, 4 and 5, or 2 and 3, or 1 and 2, or 1 and 3. Since house 3 already has tulips and house 4 has daffodils, the only possible pair is houses 2 and 3.

   - House 2: Computer
   - House 3: Tulips
   - House 4: Daffodils
   - House 5: Lilies

6. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television.
   - This means the phone and television must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. Since house 2 already has a computer, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 3.

   - House 1: Phone
   - House 3: Tulips
   - House 2: Computer
   - House 4: Daffodils
   - House 5: Lilies

7. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is already satisfied as house 4 has daffodils.

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the dog owner lives.

1. The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house.
5. The fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
6. The bird keeper lives in the first house.
7. The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
9. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.
10. The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
11. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in the second house, so there's a contradiction. Let's assume the fish enthusiast is in another house.

From clue 6, the bird keeper lives in the first house. This means the bird keeper is in the first house.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer is in the second house, the person with loafers must be in the first house. But we already know the bird keeper is in the first house, so this is a contradiction. Let's assume the cricketer is in the third house and the person with loafers is in the second house.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives. Since the bird keeper is in the first house, the person with sandals must be in the third or fifth house.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. So, the person with running shoes must be in the first, second, third, or fifth house.

From clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. So, the baseball player must be in the fifth house if the person with sandals is in the third house.

From clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the cat lover must be in the fifth house.

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person with boots is in the fifth house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Cricketer, Loafers
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Golfers, Cat Lover
- House 5: Running Shoes, Baseball Player, Person with Boots

The dog owner must be in the third house because the only house left is the third house.

So, the dog owner lives in **House 3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

We have two houses, and each house has one person. We know some things about the people:

1. One person drinks root beer, and the other drinks water.
2. One person eats bananas, and the other eats grapes.
3. One person had pizza for lunch, and the other had stew.
4. One person drives a truck, and the other drives a minivan.
5. One person has a radio, and the other has a computer.

We also have some clues:
1. The person with the radio and the person who drives a truck live next to each other.
2. The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
4. The person who eats grapes lives next to the person who has a computer.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives.

From clue 3, the root beer lover is in house 2 because they do not live in house 1.

From clue 4, the person who eats grapes must be in house 1 because they live next to the person who has a computer.

So, the person who eats grapes is in house 1, and the person who has a computer is in house 2.

Now, clue 2 tells us that the person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with the radio is in house 1 (because the root beer lover is in house 2), the person who had pizza must be in house 1.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes green lives.

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 is the tea drinker.

2. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the milk drinker and the spaghetti eater are not next to each other.

3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the yellow liker are not next to each other.

4. The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - So, the white liker and the water drinker are in adjacent houses.

5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the tea drinker (House 1) and the pizza eater (House 2) are next to each other.

6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the spaghetti eater and the water drinker are not next to each other.

7. The person who likes green does not live in the first house.
   - So, the green liker is not in House 1.

8. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - So, the grilled cheese eater is not in House 1.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- The green liker cannot be in House 1.
- The green liker cannot be in House 4 (since the grilled cheese eater is there).
- The green liker cannot be in House 2 (since the pizza eater is there).
- The green liker must be in House 3.

So, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes red lives.

1. The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.
2. The dog owner lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
3. There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.
4. The dog owner lives in the third house.
5. There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
6. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

11. The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
12. The person who likes white lives in the third house.
13. The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From Clue 4, we know the dog owner lives in the third house. So, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house (Clue 2).

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house, but we already know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. So, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house. So, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house (Clue 12).

From Clue 13, the fish enthusiast lives in the first house. But we already said the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So, the fish enthusiast must live in the first house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house (Clue 8).

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, the person who likes red must live in the second house.

So, the person who likes red lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (C) 2."

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Person wearing running shoes.

- House 2: Golfer (eating grapes).
- House 3: Person wearing running shoes.

- House 3: Person wearing running shoes.
- House 4: Person only drinks water (likes milk).
- House 5: Person only drinks water.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in **House 1**.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. The people play different sports, eat different foods for lunch, and have different flowers in their houses. Here are the clues again:

1. The golfer lives next to the basketball player.
2. The person who has lilies lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has tulips doesn't live in the third house.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the arrangement:

- The soccer player lives in house number 3. So, house 3 is taken.
- From clue 1, the golfer and the basketball player must be in houses 1 and 2. They are next to each other.
- From clue 2, the person who has lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese must be next to each other, and the person who has lilies is next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese must be next to the person who ate spaghetti.
- From clue 5, the person who has tulips doesn't live in house 3, so house 3 is not for tulips.

Let's try to fit everything together:

- If the person who has lilies is in house 1, then the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (because they are next to each other).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4 (because they are next to the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has lilies is in house 1).
- The person who has tulips must be in house 2 (because house 2 is taken by the person who ate grilled cheese, and house 3 is taken by the soccer player).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with lilies
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the primary school level education persona.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a person living in it. We need to figure out which house the person who ate fried rice lives in.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
4. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
5. The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
6. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
7. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
8. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
9. The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
10. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
11. The person who had fried rice lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who likes red.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing running shoes lives.

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - So, the third house is occupied by the tea drinker.

2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the root beer lover lives in a house with a higher number than the person who is wearing sandals.

4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses.

7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2, 3, or 4.

Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's place the person who ate grilled cheese in house 2 (since house 3 is occupied by the tea drinker and house 4 is not ruled out yet):
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker

Now, the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 4), so the only option left is house 4.

Now, we have:
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 1 for the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), the person who had stew must be in house 1, which is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater.

So, the only remaining option for the person who had stew is house 2, but we already have grilled cheese in house 2. This means we need to recheck the placement.

Since house 2 is already taken by grilled cheese, the person who had stew must be in house 1, which is not possible. So, let's try house 1 for the person who had stew:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

Now, the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 4), so the only option left is house 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 2 for the person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 5). The person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew (Clue 5), and the only option left is house 2.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

1. The cricketer lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
3. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
4. The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
5. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
6. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
10. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house.
11. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
12. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
13. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 1, 2, and 3, we know:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Eighth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate spaghetti

From clue 10, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, the person who had stew must live in the ninth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the tenth house.

From clue 8, the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person who has a computer must live in the second house, and the soccer player must live in the fourth house.

So, the person with the computer lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

We have two houses, and one person lives in each. We know:
- One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
- One person likes science fiction books and the other likes history books.
- The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books.

Let's list the possibilities:
- House 1: Person who ate pizza (science fiction book fan) or Person who ate fried rice (history book fan)
- House 2: Person who ate fried rice (science fiction book fan) or Person who ate pizza (history book fan)

Since the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books, the only way this can happen is if:
- The person who ate pizza (science fiction book fan) lives in House 1.
- The person who ate fried rice (history book fan) lives in House 2.

So, the person who likes science fiction books lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The pianist lives in house 1.
2. The root beer lover lives in house 2.
3. The person who likes white lives in house 1.
4. The person who owns horses lives in house 1.

From these clues, we know:
- The person who owns horses (dog owner) lives in house 1.
- The person who likes white lives in house 1.
- The root beer lover lives in house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - So, house 4: Pizza eater

2. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - So, house 2: Stew eater

3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

4. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 3.

5. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - So, house 4: Pizza eater

Now, let's place the known elements:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

1. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Likes white

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Not wearing boots

3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Not a bird keeper

4. The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - So, House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils

5. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - So, House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Likes green (since it's directly left of the person wearing running shoes)

6. The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - So, House 3: Owns horses
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 1: Likes white

7. The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - So, House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

8. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - So, House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

From Clue 7, we know that the person who owns horses lives in House 3 and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in House 2.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who owns horses (House 3) and the person who has daffodils (House 2) are next to each other, the person who likes green must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3. However, since the person who owns horses is already in House 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Likes white, Wearing sandals
- House 2: Has daffodils, Wearing running shoes
- House 3: Owns horses, Wearing boots

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it.
2. Each person is eating a different kind of fruit: apples, oranges, or mangos.
3. Each person has a different favorite drink: coffee, root beer, or milk.
4. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
5. The person who eats mangos lives directly left of the person who eats apples.
6. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
7. The person who eats apples lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who eats apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From clue 2, the person who eats mangos lives directly left of the person who eats apples. Since the person who eats apples is in the third house, the person who eats mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who eats mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person who eats mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

So, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where each person lives based on the clues given:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live next to each other.
   - This means they can be in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3.

3. The person who likes white lives next to the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means they can be in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3.

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means they can only live in House 1 or House 2.

6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. Each house has a different person living in it.
3. Each person has different flowers: lilies, tulips, and roses.
4. Each person has a different drink: milk, root beer, and water.

We know:
- The person who only drinks water lives in house 1.
- The person who has lilies lives in house 2.
- The person who has lilies is to the right of the person who has tulips.
- The person who has milk lives next to the person who has tulips.

So, let's figure out where the person who has tulips lives:
- Since the person who has lilies is in house 2, the person who has tulips must be in house 3.
- This means the person who has milk must be in house 1, but we already know the person who only drinks water lives in house 1.
- So, the person who has milk must be in house 3.

Now we know:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has lilies
- House 3: Person who has milk

The only person left is the one who has roses. So, the person who has roses lives in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who has a rose bouquet lives is house 2.

9. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 9, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. So, the first house is:
- Person who likes green
- Person who is wearing loafers
- Person who has a radio

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the third house is:
- Person who likes yellow
- Person who has a gameboy

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house. So, the third house is:
- Person who likes blue
- Person who has a gameboy

This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who has a gameboy also lives in the third house. So, the third house is:
- Person who likes blue
- Person who has a gameboy

From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house. So, the second house can be:
- Person who likes green
- Person who has a phone

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in the second house. So, the second house is:
- Person who likes green

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in the second house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. So, if the person who is wearing sandals lives in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone lives in the second house, the person who has a radio must live in the first house.

So, the houses are:
- First house: Person who likes green, person who is wearing loafers, person who has a radio
- Second house: Person who likes green, person who has a phone
- Third house: Person who likes blue, person who has a gameboy
- Fourth house: Person who likes white, person who is wearing sandals, person who has a television

Therefore, the cricketer lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it.
2. Each person likes a different kind of book: science fiction, romance, and history.
3. Each person's favorite color is different: green, yellow, and blue.
4. Each person had a different lunch: grilled cheese, fried rice, and pizza.
5. We have some clues to figure out where each person lives.

Clues:
1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives:

- From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house (house 1).
- From clue 2, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff must be in house 3, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.
- From clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house. So, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.
- From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow (likes yellow)
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: History book buff (likes history)

The person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

So, the correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Let's think through this step by step to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person with a different device and flowers. The clues are:
1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (clue 4 and clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

Let's check the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

So, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The swimmer lives in the third house.
2. The violinist lives in the second house.
3. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
8. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
9. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
10. The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
11. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.

Now, let's fill in the houses step by step:

- House 1: Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
- House 2: Violinist.
- House 3: Swimmer.
- House 4: Cricketer.
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils.

Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 5, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 4 (because they live directly left of the person with daffodils).

So, house 4: Running shoes, Bouquet of daffodils.

Now, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1 (because they live directly left of the person with tulips).

So, house 1: Sandals.

The person who has a carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (because they live somewhere to the right of the guitarist).

So, house 2: Carnations.

The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3 (because they live directly left of the percussionist).

So, house 3: Loafers.

The person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4 (because they live somewhere to the right of the person with lilies).

So, house 4: Running shoes, Bouquet of daffodils.

The person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1 (because they live directly left of the person with tulips).

So, house 1: Sandals.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 3 (because they live somewhere to the right of the person with high heels).

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating oranges lives.

1. The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other.
2. The person with a phone lives in the third house.
3. The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.
4. The flutist lives in the third house.
5. The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots.
6. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
7. The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
8. The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
9. The person with a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
10. There are two houses between where the person wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
11. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges.
12. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
13. The science fiction book fanatic and the person wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person with a phone.

From clue 4, the flutist lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the flutist.

From clue 6, the person wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. This contradicts clue 2, so we need to re-evaluate. Since clue 2 states the phone lives in the third house, and clue 6 states the running shoes live in the third house, we need to consider the possibility that the phone and running shoes are different people.

From clue 1, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Let's denote the person eating grapes as G and the person eating oranges as O. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From clue 5, the person eating oranges (O) lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots (B). From clue 3, the saxophonist (S) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots (B). This means B must be to the right of S.

From clue 7, the romance book lover (R) lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF). This means R and SF must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person wearing high heels (HH) lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast (FB) lives. This means HH and FB must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 5 (but since we only have 4 houses, it must be 1 and 4).

From clue 12, the history book buff (HB) lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges (O). This means HB must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 13, the person eating kiwis (K) does not live in the first house. So K must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 14, the percussionist (P) lives in the fourth house. So P is in house 4.

From clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic (SF) and the person wearing running shoes (RS) live directly next to each other. Since RS lives in the third house, SF must live in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: HB (History book buff)
- House 2: SF (Science fiction book fanatic)
- House 3: RS (Running shoes)
- House 4: P (Percussionist)

Since the person eating oranges (O) must be to the right of the person wearing boots (B) and B must be to the right of S, and O must be to the right of B, the only possible positions for O and B are:
- O in house 4 (since P is in house 4)
- B in house 3 (since RS is in house 3)

This leaves the person eating grapes (G) and the person wearing boots (B) in houses 1 and 2. Since HB is in house 1, B must be in house 2, and G must be in house 1.

So, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Let's figure out where the person who eats apples lives step by step.

1. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. So, if the person who had pizza is in house 2, the person who likes yellow must be in house 3.
2. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. So, if the person who eats oranges is in house 1, the person who eats apples must be in house 2.
3. The person who had stew does not live in the third house. So, the person who had stew can be in house 1, 2, or 4.
4. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. So, if the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2.
5. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. So, if the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who likes white must be in house 4.
6. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza. So, if the person who had pizza is in house 2, the person who eats apples must be in house 4.

From the above clues, we can see that the person who eats apples must be in house 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives. We have clues that help us place everyone in their houses.

1. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.

7. The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
8. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.

Let's start with the convertible in the first house:
- House 1: Convertible

Next, the SUV is directly left of the history book buff:
- House 2: SUV
- House 3: History book buff

The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff:
- House 4: Grilled cheese

The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels:

- House 2: Truck
- House 3: Mystery book reader

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice:
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Fried rice

So, the person who had pizza must be in House 4.

The number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is 4."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. The saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other, so the violinist must be in the third house.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
6. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
7. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

From clue 7, we know the saxophonist is in the fourth house. So, the saxophonist and the violinist are next to each other, and the violinist is in the third house.

Now, let's place the other people:

- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.
- The violinist is in the third house.
- The mystery book reader is in the fourth house, but the saxophonist is already there, so the mystery book reader must be in the fifth house.
- The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover must be in the second house.
- The history book buff lives one house to the left of the guitarist, and there is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist. So, the history book buff is in the first house, and the guitarist is in the second house.

So, the houses are:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover (also percussionist)
- House 3: Violinist
- House 4: Saxophonist (also mystery book reader)
- House 5: Fantasy book enthusiast

The violinist lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the television is in the fourth house.
2. The person wearing loafers is in the second house.
3. The person with a phone is not in the second house.
4. The person wearing boots is somewhere to the left of the person wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person with a radio lives and where the person wearing sandals lives.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 4: Television

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Loafers

From clue 3, we know:
- House 3: Phone (since the phone can't be in house 2)

From clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Boots (since the boots must be to the left of the loafers)

Now we have:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

We need to place the radio and the gameboy in the remaining houses (houses 1, 2, 3, and 4). But we know:
- The radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4.

Let's try placing the radio in house 1 and sandals in house 3:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 1: Radio
- House 3: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which is consistent with clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

So, the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:
- One person likes milk.
- One person only drinks water.
- One person drinks coffee.
- One person wears loafers.
- One person wears running shoes.
- One person wears high heels.

We also have some clues:
1. The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who wears running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

From clue 5, the person who wears running shoes lives in house number 3.

So, the only house left for the person who likes milk is house number 1.

From clue 3, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. But we already know the first house is for the person who likes milk.

From clue 4, the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is for the person who likes milk, the coffee drinker must live in house number 2.

But we already know the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2. So, the coffee drinker must live in house number 1.

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have two houses, and two people. One person likes history books, and the other likes mystery books. One person is wearing loafers, and the other is wearing high heels. We know some things:

1. The person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house.

Now, let's figure out where each person lives:

- If the mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house, that means the mystery book reader must live in the first house.
- If the mystery book reader lives in the first house, then the person wearing loafers must live in the second house because the person wearing loafers can't live in the first house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the primary school level education persona.

We have 4 houses, and each house has a different person with different things. We need to figure out which house the person who had pizza lives in.

1. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.
2. The person who had pizza lives next to the person who is wearing sandals.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house.
4. The person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who had pizza.
5. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
6. The person who is wearing running shoes lives next to the person who had stew.
7. The person who has a television lives next to the person who has a radio.
8. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live next to each other.
9. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. The person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who has a radio.

Let's try to place the people step by step:

- From clue 2, the person who had pizza and the person who is wearing sandals must be next to each other.
- From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house.
- From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who had pizza.
- From clue 5, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
- From clue 6, the person who is wearing running shoes lives next to the person who had stew.
- From clue 7, the person who has a television lives next to the person who has a radio.
- From clue 8, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live next to each other.
- From clue 9, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
- From clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who has a radio.

Let's try placing the pizza person and sandals person:

- If the pizza person is in house 1, then the sandals person must be in house 2 (since they are next to each other).
- If the sandals person is in house 2, then the running shoes person cannot be in house 3 (from clue 3).
- If the running shoes person is in house 1, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are next to each other).
- If the gameboy person is in house 2, then the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 1 (since they are next to each other).
- If the person with the vase of tulips is in house 1, then the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (since they are next to each other).
- This means the person with the carnations arrangement is in house 2, which is the same as the sandals person, so this doesn't work.

Let's try another arrangement:

- If the pizza person is in house 2, then the sandals person must be in house 3 (since they are next to each other).
- If the sandals person is in house 3, then the running shoes person cannot be in house 4 (from clue 3).
- If the running shoes person is in house 3, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 4 (since they are next to each other).
- If the gameboy person is in house 4, then the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (since they are next to each other).
- If the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3, then the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 4 (since they are next to each other).
- This means the person with the carnations arrangement is in house 4, which is to the right of the sandals person, so this works.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
2. The saxophonist lives in the second house.
3. The rose bouquet is in the first house.
4. The lilies are in the second house.

So, the person eating apples must be in the second house because the mangos are in the first house and the saxophonist is in the second house. The lilies are in the second house, so the person with the lilies can't be eating apples.

Therefore, the person eating apples must be in the second house.

The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
2. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.
3. The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
5. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
6. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.

15. The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
16. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
17. The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

From clue 5, we know the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. So, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

From clue 16, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker lives in house 4, the person who has a television must live in house 5.

So, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. Each house has a different kind of flower and a different kind of car.
3. The tulip person can't be in house 3.
4. The SUV person is next to the lilies person.
5. The sedan person and the rose person are next to each other.
6. The rose person isn't in house 2.

Let's try to figure out where each person lives:

- If the rose person is in house 1, then the sedan person must be in house 2 (because they are next to each other).
- If the sedan person is in house 2, then the rose person can't be in house 2, so the rose person must be in house 1.
- If the rose person is in house 1, then the sedan person is in house 2.
- The lilies person must be in house 3 because the SUV person is next to the lilies person.
- The tulip person can't be in house 3, so the tulip person must be in house 2.

But we already said the sedan person is in house 2, so this doesn't work. Let's try another arrangement:

- If the rose person is in house 3, then the sedan person must be in house 2 (because they are next to each other).
- If the sedan person is in house 2, then the rose person can't be in house 2, so the rose person must be in house 3.
- If the rose person is in house 3, then the sedan person is in house 2.
- The lilies person must be in house 1 because the SUV person is next to the lilies person.
- The tulip person can't be in house 3, so the tulip person must be in house 1.

This works out:

- House 1: Tulip person
- House 2: Sedan person
- House 3: Rose person
- House 3: Lilies person

So, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house. So, house 5 is for tulips.
2. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the violinist can't be in house 1, 2, or 3.
3. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
5. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
6. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.
7. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
8. The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
10. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. This means house 4 is for lilies.
11. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
12. The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
13. The history book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.
14. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
15. The pianist and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.

Now, let's fill in the houses:

- House 5: Tulips
- House 4: Lilies
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic (can't be in house 2)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast or root beer lover (next to each other)
- House 1: Romance book lover (can't be in house 3)
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic

From clue 13, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 9, the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 10, the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the person who owns an SUV must be in the second house, and the person who is eating a banana must be in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the third house, the person who likes white must be in the fourth house. But the fourth house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible. So, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.

From clue 1, the cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who drives a convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house.

From clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white is in the second house, the swimmer must be in the first house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating bananas.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating oranges.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes blue lives step by step.

1. We know the person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes green, so they must be in the second house.
3. The person who had stew lives next to the person who likes the romance book. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the first house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house, so they must be in the first house.
5. The person who had stew lives next to the romance book lover, so the romance book lover must be in the second house.

So, we have:
- First house: Person who ate grilled cheese
- Second house: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- Third house: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person who likes green is in the third house and the person who likes yellow is in the second house, the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

6. The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other.
7. The person with carnations lives in the first house.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the first house has carnations. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From clue 1, the person with tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives next to the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Second house: Tulips and bird keeper

- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have two houses, house 1 and house 2.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.
3. The cellist lives in house 2.
4. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. So, house 1 is taken by the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 2, the cellist lives in house 2. So, house 2 is taken by the cellist.

Now, we need to figure out who likes green and who likes red. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (in house 1) likes green, the person who likes red must be in house 2. So, the person who likes red lives in house 2.

This means the person who likes green lives in house 1. But we already know the fantasy book enthusiast likes green, so the person who likes green must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

Now, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (who likes green) lives in house 1.
- The cellist (who likes red) lives in house 2.

The only person left is the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader is the only one left, and we know the fantasy book enthusiast likes green and the cellist likes red, the mystery book reader must be the pianist.

So, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:
1. The golfer lives in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives in the first house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

So, let's fill in what we know:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, we need to figure out where the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic live. We know the science fiction book fanatic can't be in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

This means the swimmer must be in the first house because there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic.

So, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is (A) 1."

"Let's think about the clues one by one to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

We have two houses, and each house has a person living in it. Let's list the possible lunches, pets, books, and shoes:

- Lunches: Fried Rice, Spaghetti
- Pets: Cat Lover, Horse Owner
- Books: History Book Buff, Romance Book Lover
- Shoes: Sandals, Running Shoes

Now, let's use the clues:

### Clue 1:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
  - This means if Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals, then Person 2 (House 2) must own horses.
  - If Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals, then Person 1 (House 1) must own horses.

### Clue 2:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
  - This means if Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti, then Person 2 (House 2) must be the history book buff.
  - If Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti, then Person 1 (House 1) must be the history book buff.

Now, let's try to fit these clues together:

#### Scenario 1:
- Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals.
- Person 2 (House 2) owns horses.
- Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff.
- Person 1 (House 1) is the cat lover.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the romance book lover.
- Person 1 (House 1) is wearing running shoes.
- Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals.

In this scenario, Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti, and Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff. This fits Clue 2.

#### Scenario 2:
- Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals.
- Person 1 (House 1) owns horses.
- Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti.
- Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the cat lover.
- Person 1 (House 1) is the romance book lover.
- Person 2 (House 2) is wearing running shoes.
- Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals.

In this scenario, Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti, and Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff. This also fits Clue 2.

From both scenarios, we see that the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**."
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

We have two houses, house 1 and house 2. In house 1, there is a person who owns a sedan. In house 2, there is a person who has a bouquet of lilies. The flutist lives in house 2, so the person with the lilies can't be the flutist. That means the person with the lilies must be the saxophonist.

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the rose bouquet is in house 3.
2. The carnations are in house 4.
3. The mystery book reader is in house 1 (because there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and house 3 is taken by the rose bouquet).
4. The tennis player is in house 5 (because the tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader, and house 4 is taken by the carnations).
5. The fantasy book enthusiast is in house 2 (because the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer, and house 2 is taken by the fantasy book enthusiast).
6. The golfer is in house 5 (because the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and house 5 is taken by the golfer).
7. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 4 (because there is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet, and house 4 is taken by the carnations).

So, the only house left for the romance book lover is house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

1. The coffee drinker lives in house 3.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The saxophonist does not live in house 2.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in house 2.
5. The person who has a gameboy does not live in house 2.
6. The person who has a gameboy lives in house 4 and the computer lives in house 5.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.
8. The person who only drinks water does not live in house 4.
9. The person who likes milk lives in house 5.

14. The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.
15. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.

- House 1: Water drinker (from clue 13 and 15)
- House 2: Rose bouquet (from clue 13 and 15)
- House 4: Phone (from clue 13 and 15)

So, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the rose bouquet lives.

1. The golfer lives in the first house.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.
3. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
5. The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.

7. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
8. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
9. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan.

From clue 8, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. So, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second house.

From clue 9, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. So, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, the person who had pizza must live in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who had pizza does not live in the second house. This is already satisfied since the person with pizza lives in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. This doesn't give us a specific house yet, but it's consistent with the other clues.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house. But we already know the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who had pizza lives in the third house, and we already know the person who had pizza lives in the third house.

So, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."

9. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
10. There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives.
11. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
12. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
13. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist.
14. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 1: Cellist and Spaghetti eater (they must be next to each other)
- House 4: Fried rice eater
- House 5: Pizza eater

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti must be next to each other, and the pizza eater is directly left of the fried rice eater, we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Fried rice eater
- House 5: Pizza eater

The person who likes yellow must be somewhere to the left of the saxophonist, and the root beer lover must be somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Also, there is one house between the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover. So, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1, and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist (Person who likes yellow)
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Fried rice eater
- House 5: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know Fried Rice is in house 3.
2. Green can't be in house 2.
3. Stew can't be in house 2 or 4.
4. Blue must be to the left of Spaghetti.
5. Grilled Cheese must be to the right of White.
6. Red is next to Stew.
7. Fried Rice is in house 3.
8. White and Yellow are one house apart.

Let's try to place the people:

- Fried Rice is in house 3.
- White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.
- Stew can't be in house 2 or 4.
- Red is next to Stew.
- Blue must be to the left of Spaghetti.
- Grilled Cheese must be to the right of White.

Let's try house 2 for White:
- If White is in house 2, Yellow must be in house 4 (because White and Yellow are one house apart).
- If White is in house 2, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (because Green can't be in house 2).
- If White is in house 2, Yellow is in house 4, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 4 (because Red is next to Stew).

This doesn't work because Yellow and White can't be in houses 2 and 4 at the same time.

Let's try house 4 for White:
- If White is in house 4, Yellow must be in house 2 (because White and Yellow are one house apart).
- If White is in house 4, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (because Green can't be in house 2).
- If White is in house 4, Yellow is in house 2, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 5 (because Red is next to Stew).

This works because Red is in house 5, and Stew must be in house 4 (because Red is next to Stew).

So, the person who likes white lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We know the percussionist lives in house 2.
2. The person who likes red lives in house 3.
3. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in house 2.
5. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.

So, we have:
- House 1: Not occupied
- House 2: Occupied by the percussionist
- House 3: Occupied by the person who likes red
- House 4: Not occupied

Now, we need to place the violinist, tennis player, and basketball player in houses 1, 2, and 4.

From clue 3, the violinist must be to the right of the basketball player. This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

From clue 5, the basketball player must be to the right of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in house 2. This means the person who likes yellow must be in house 1 or house 4.

Since the percussionist is in house 2 and the person who likes red is in house 3, the only place left for the person who likes yellow is house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: Person who likes red
- House 4: Violinist

The basketball player must be in house 4 because the violinist is to the right of the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person with different things. We need to figure out which house has the person with carnations.

Here are the clues again:
1. The computer lives next to the root beer lover.
2. The cellist lives next to the tulip person.
3. The root beer lover and the coffee drinker are next to each other.
4. There's one house between the phone and the TV.
5. The daffodil person is next to the cellist.
6. The percussionist is next to the gameboy person.
7. Carnations are not in the third house.
8. The cellist is next to the guitarist.
9. The cellist is not in the fourth house.
10. Coffee is to the right of milk.
11. Guitar is to the right of the phone.
12. Root beer is to the left of percussion.
13. Root beer is to the left of the lily person.
14. Daffodil and coffee are one house apart.
15. Carnations are not in the fifth house.
16. Tea is to the left of the pianist.

Now, let's think about the houses and the people:

- The computer and root beer lover are next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- The cellist and tulip person are next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- The root beer lover and coffee drinker are next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- There's one house between the phone and the TV. So, they could be in houses 1 and 4, or 2 and 5.
- The daffodil and coffee are one house apart. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- The cellist and guitarist are next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- The cellist is not in the fourth house.
- The cellist is not in the fifth house.
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist.
- The root beer lover is to the left of the lily person.
- The tea is to the left of the pianist.

Let's try to fit all these clues together:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, then the computer must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
- The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (Clue 3).
- The cellist and tulip person must be next to each other. If the cellist is in house 2, the tulip person must be in house 3.
- The daffodil and coffee are one house apart. If the coffee drinker is in house 2, the daffodil must be in house 1.
- The cellist and guitarist are next to each other. If the cellist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 3.
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist. If the root beer lover is in house 1, the percussionist must be in house 5.
- The root beer lover is to the left of the lily person. If the root beer lover is in house 1, the lily person must be in house 2.
- The tea is to the left of the pianist. If the tea drinker is in house 1, the pianist must be in house 5.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Root beer
- House 3: Tulips
- House 4: Coffee
- House 5: Percussionist

Therefore, the person with carnations lives in house 1.

The answer is (E) 1."

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step again, like I'm explaining it to a primary school student.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person with a different pet, device, and car. We need to figure out which house has the person with the vase of tulips.

1. The dog owner is in the second house.
2. The fish enthusiast is in the third house.
3. The person with the gameboy is not in the second house.
4. The person with the bouquet of daffodils is next to the person with the truck.
5. The person with the bouquet of lilies is not in the fifth house.
6. The person with the gameboy is next to the bird keeper.
7. The person with the vase of tulips is next to the person with the horse.
8. The person with the vase of tulips and the person with the convertible are next to each other.
9. There are two houses between the person with the truck and the person with the convertible.
10. The person with the computer is not in the fifth house.
11. The person with the carnations is not in the fifth house.
12. There is one house between the person with the television and the person with the SUV.

Let's start by putting the dog owner in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: ?
- House 5: ?

Next, the truck and the convertible must be next to each other with two houses between them. So, the truck is in House 4 and the convertible is in House 6 (but House 6 is not there, so it must be House 5):
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

Now, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be next to the person with the truck:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1:
- House 1: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The gameboy must be next to the radio, and the gameboy is not in the second house:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The bouquet of lilies is not in the fifth house:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The gameboy is next to the bird keeper:
- House 1: Gameboy

The person with the vase of tulips and the person with the convertible are next to each other:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

- House 5: Convertible

There are two houses between the person with the truck and the person with the convertible:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The person with the computer is not in the fifth house:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The person with the carnations is not in the fifth house:
- House 1: Gameboy

There is one house between the person with the television and the person with the SUV:
- House 1: Gameboy

- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Television

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the primary school level education.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:
- One person is a fish enthusiast.
- One person is a dog owner.
- One person is a cat lover.
- One person ate spaghetti.
- One person ate stew.
- One person ate pizza.
- One person plays basketball.
- One person plays cricket.
- One person plays tennis.
- One person plays the saxophone.
- One person plays the guitar.
- One person plays the violin.
- One person drinks tea.
- One person drinks milk.
- One person only drinks water.

We also have these clues:
1. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
2. The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
3. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
4. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Let's figure out where each person lives:

1. The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)

2. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)

3. The person who only drinks water lives in house 1.
   - House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist, only drinks water)

4. The fish enthusiast lives in house 3.
   - House 3: Fish enthusiast

5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - House 2: Tea drinker (cricketer)

6. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - House 2: Pizza eater (dog owner)

7. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - House 3: Cat lover (guitarist)

8. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - House 2: Stew eater (milk drinker)

So, the house where the dog owner lives is house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
2. The history book buff lives in the first house.
3. The cat lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives in house 1. So, house 1 has a history book and the person with loafers (loafers).

From clue 3, the cat lover does not live in house 2, so the cat lover must live in house 1. But we already know the history book buff is in house 1, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the cat lover must live in house 2.

From clue 4, the person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person with loafers. Since the history book buff is in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 2 (since house 1 is already taken by the history book buff).

So, the person with a computer lives in house 2, and the person with loafers must live in house 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: History book buff (romance book lover) and person with loafers (loafers)
- House 2: Cat lover (cat enthusiast) and person with computer (computer)

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person with loafers is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1. This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

So, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who has carnations lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

2. The person who has apples lives directly left of the person who has fried rice.
   - This means if the person with apples is in house 2, the person with fried rice must be in house 3.
   - If the person with apples is in house 3, the person with fried rice must be in house 4.
   - If the person with apples is in house 4, the person with fried rice must be in house 5.

3. The person who has apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who has daffodils.
   - This means if the person with apples is in house 2, the person with daffodils must be in house 3.
   - If the person with apples is in house 3, the person with daffodils must be in house 4.
   - If the person with apples is in house 4, the person with daffodils must be in house 5.

4. There are two houses between where the person who has bananas lives and where the pianist lives.
   - This means if the pianist is in house 1, the person with bananas must be in house 3 or 4.
   - If the pianist is in house 2, the person with bananas must be in house 4 or 5.
   - If the pianist is in house 3, the person with bananas must be in house 5.
   - If the pianist is in house 4, the person with bananas must be in house 1 or 2.
   - If the pianist is in house 5, the person with bananas must be in house 1 or 2.

5. The person who has mangos does not live in the fourth house.
   - This means the person with mangos cannot be in house 4.

6. The person who has tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person with tulips cannot be in house 3.

7. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - This means if the saxophonist is in house 1, the person with pizza must be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - If the saxophonist is in house 2, the person with pizza must be in house 3, 4, or 5.
   - If the saxophonist is in house 3, the person with pizza must be in house 4 or 5.
   - If the saxophonist is in house 4, the person with pizza must be in house 5.
   - If the saxophonist is in house 5, the person with pizza must be in house 1, 2, or 3.

8. The person who had stew lives next to the person who had grilled cheese.
   - This means if the person with stew is in house 1, the person with grilled cheese must be in house 2.
   - If the person with stew is in house 2, the person with grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3.
   - If the person with stew is in house 3, the person with grilled cheese must be in house 2 or 4.
   - If the person with stew is in house 4, the person with grilled cheese must be in house 3 or 5.
   - If the person with stew is in house 5, the person with grilled cheese must be in house 4.

9. The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.
   - This means the person with pizza cannot be in house 5.

10. The person who has carnations lives in the first house.
    - House 1: Carnations

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- The person with carnations is in house 1.
- The person with apples must be in house 2 because they live directly left of the person with fried rice.
- The person with tulips cannot be in house 3.
- The person with mangos cannot be in house 4.

"Let's figure out where the cellist lives. We know the following from the clues:

1. The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
4. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
8. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.
9. The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
12. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
13. The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
14. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

From clue 1, we know the second house is the history book buff.

From clue 10, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. So, pizza must be in the first house and fried rice must be in the fourth house.

From clue 11, the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the percussionist must be in the second house.

From clue 12, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house, which is correct since pizza is in the first house and fried rice is in the fourth house.

From clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. So, the guitarist is in the first house and the person who has a vase of tulips is in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. So, the person who likes white is in the first house and the romance book lover is in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

From clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza is in the first house, this clue is satisfied.

From clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the fourth house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
1. Pizza (Fantasy book enthusiast)
2. Guitarist (Romance book lover)
3. Spaghetti (Percussionist)
4. Fried rice (History book buff)

The cellist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cellist lives is 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. Each house has a different person living in it, and each person plays a different instrument and eats a different fruit.
3. The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
4. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
5. There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
6. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's start by putting the pianist and the person eating kiwis next to each other. They can be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

### Case 1: Pianist in house 1 and person eating kiwis in house 2
- Violinist must be in house 3 (because the flutist lives to the right of the violinist).
- Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (because there is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis, and the person eating kiwis is in house 2).

But this doesn't work because house 1 is already taken by the pianist.

### Case 2: Pianist in house 2 and person eating kiwis in house 3
- Violinist must be in house 1 (because there is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis, and the person eating kiwis is in house 3).
- Person eating grapes must be in house 2 (because there is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis, and the violinist is in house 1).

This works because:
- Pianist in house 2
- Violinist in house 1
- Flutist in house 3
- Person eating grapes in house 2

So, the pianist lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, and one person lives in each house.
2. In the first house, someone is eating kiwis.
3. In the second house, someone is reading a fantasy book.
4. The person who eats kiwis can't be in the first house because the fantasy book reader is not in the first house either.

So, if the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person reading a fantasy book must be in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

We have two houses, and we know the following:
- The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
- The pianist lives next to the cellist.

Since the root beer lover cannot be in the second house, they must be in the first house. If the root beer lover is in the first house, the pianist and the cellist must be in the second house. But the pianist and the cellist must be next to each other, so the pianist must be in the first house and the cellist must be in the second house.

So, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to find out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
2. The person with sandals is not in the fifth house.
3. The person with boots and the person with carnations are next to each other.
4. The person with tulips is next to the person with loafers.
5. The person with tulips is to the right of the person with daffodils.
6. The person with sandals is not in the fourth house.
7. The person with tulips is in the fourth house.
8. The person with running shoes and the person with daffodils are next to each other.
9. The person with running shoes is one house away from the person with lilies.

From clue 7, we know the person with carnations is in the fifth house. So, the fifth house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From clue 6, the person with sandals is not in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is not occupied by sandals.

From clue 8, the person with tulips is in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person with tulips.

From clue 9, the person with running shoes is one house away from the person with lilies. Since the person with tulips is in the fourth house, the person with running shoes must be in the third house, and the person with lilies must be in the fifth house.

But we already know the fifth house is occupied by the person with carnations. So, the person with lilies must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."

Let's start with clue 2. The baseball player is not in house 2. So, the baseball player can be in house 1, 3, or 4.

Clue 3 says the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 4, and the person who only drinks water cannot be in house 1.

Clue 4 says the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer cannot be in house 4, and the person who only drinks water cannot be in house 1.

Clue 5 says there is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the grapes person and the tennis player are not adjacent.

Clue 6 says there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the green person are not adjacent.

Clue 7 says the saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist cannot be in house 4, and the tennis player cannot be in house 1.

Clue 8 says there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the blue person and the oranges person are not adjacent.

Clue 9 says there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives. This means the white person and the tea drinker are not adjacent.

Clue 10 says the swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means the swimmer and the white person are in adjacent houses.

Clue 11 says the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist cannot be in house 4, and the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1.

Clue 12 says the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the blue person cannot be in house 4, and the tea drinker cannot be in house 1.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it.
2. Each person ate a different lunch: spaghetti, fried rice, or stew.
3. Each person likes a different color: white, green, or red.
4. Each person wears different shoes: boots, running shoes, or high heels.

We have some clues:
1. The person wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the first house is white and had stew. From clue 4, the second house is green and likes green. From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. But since the first house is white and had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is white and had stew, the second house is green and likes green, and the third house is spaghetti and lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels lives in the first house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house. But we already know the first house is white and had stew.

So, the first house is white and had stew, the second house is green and likes green, and the third house is spaghetti and lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, and we already know the first house is white and had stew, so the person who had stew must live in the third house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3 because they live next to the rose bouquet person.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, house 1 and house 2.
2. In house 1, there is a person who likes science fiction books.
3. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
4. The coffee drinker can't be in house 1 because the science fiction book lover is there.
5. So, the coffee drinker must be in house 2.
6. The person wearing sandals can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 1.
7. That leaves the person who likes romance books to be in house 2.

So, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have two houses, and two people living in them. One person plays the piano, and the other plays percussion. One person has a radio, and the other has a phone.

1. The percussionist lives next to the person with the radio.
2. The percussionist is in House 1 because the percussionist and the radio person must be next to each other, and the percussionist is to the left.

So, the percussionist is in House 1, and the person with the radio is in House 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Person with the radio

The pianist must be in House 2 because the pianist and percussionist can't be in the same house. So, the pianist is in House 2.

That leaves the phone for House 1. So, the person with the phone lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:
(A) 1"
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. So, the second house is taken by the person who drives a convertible.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

Let's put this into a simple chart:

| House | Person's Favorite Color | Person's Car Type |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| 1     | ?                       | ?                 |
| 2     | Convertible             | ?                 |
| 3     | ?                       | ?                 |

From clue 2, the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3. Let's try different combinations:

- If the person who likes white is in house 1, then the person who owns a sedan must be in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, then the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement would be:

- House 1: Person who likes white
- House 2: Person who likes yellow
- House 3: Person who owns a sedan

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Running shoes

2. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Sedan

3. The dog owner does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not dog owner

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - House 1: Running shoes
   - House 2: Sandals
   - House 3: Sedan
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 5: High heels

5. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the bird keeper lives.
   - Running shoes (House 1)
   - Bird keeper (House 4)
   - Two houses between House 1 and House 4: Houses 2 and 3

6. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 5: High heels

7. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
   - House 5: High heels
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 3: Sedan
   - House 2: Sandals
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. The fish enthusiast does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Sedan

9. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - House 5: High heels
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 3: Sedan
   - House 2: Sandals
   - House 1: Running shoes

10. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: High heels

11. The fish enthusiast does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: High heels

12. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
    - House 1: Running shoes

13. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
    - House 5: High heels
    - House 4: Bird keeper
    - House 3: Sedan
    - House 2: Sandals
    - House 1: Running shoes

From the clues, we can see that the fish enthusiast lives in the fifth house. The person who owns horses must live somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. The only house to the right of the fifth house is the fourth house, but the fourth house is already taken by the bird keeper. So, the person who owns horses must live in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who drives a truck lives in.

1. We know the convertible is in the first house.
2. The bird keeper is in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing loafers is in the second house.
4. The person who is eating grapes and the fish enthusiast are next to each other.
5. The person who is wearing sandals is next to the person who drives a truck.
6. The person who is eating grapes is not in the fourth house.
7. The person who owns a sedan is next to the cat lover.
8. The person who has a bouquet of lilies is somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
9. The person who has a vase of tulips is next to the person who is wearing boots.
10. The person who has a rose bouquet is next to the person who has a vase of tulips.
11. There are two houses between where the person who has a bouquet of lilies is and where the person who is wearing high heels is.
12. The person who is eating oranges is two houses away from the dog owner.
13. The person who owns a sedan is next to the person who owns an SUV.

Let's fill in the houses step by step:

- House 1: Bird Keeper (since it's the first house and the bird keeper lives there)
- House 2: Loafers (since it's the second house and the person who is wearing loafers lives there)
- House 3: Fish Enthusiast (since it's the third house and the fish enthusiast lives there)
- House 4: Sandals (since it's the fourth house and the person who is wearing sandals lives there)
- House 5: Truck (since it's the fifth house and the person who drives a truck lives there)

So, the person who drives a truck lives in House 5.

The correct answer is (C) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following:
- One person ate fried rice, one ate spaghetti, and one ate grilled cheese.
- One person likes science fiction books, one likes fantasy books, and one likes mystery books.
- The fried rice person lives in the second house.
- The fantasy book person lives in the second house.

So, the second house is occupied by the person who likes fantasy books and ate fried rice.

Now, we know the second house is:
- Fried Rice
- Fantasy Book Enthusiast

This means the first house can't be the fried rice person, so it must be the person who ate spaghetti. The third house must be the grilled cheese person.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

We have two houses, and we know:
- House 1 has a person with tulips.
- House 2 has a person with carnations.
- House 1 also has a person with a dog.
- House 2 has a person with horses.

The clue tells us that the person with carnations (carnations arrangement) lives somewhere to the left of the person with a dog.

Since the person with the dog lives in House 1 (because the dog is to the left), the person with the carnations must live in House 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have two houses, house 1 and house 2.
2. In house 1, we have someone who only drinks water and someone who wears sandals.
3. In house 2, we have someone who eats kiwis and someone who likes yellow.
4. The person who eats kiwis is in house 2.

Now, let's use the clues:

- Clue 1 says the person who only drinks water is next to the person who wears high heels.
- Clue 2 says the person who wears sandals is next to the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 3 says the person who eats kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who only drinks water is next to the person who wears high heels.

Since the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1 (because the person wearing sandals is in house 1, and the person who only drinks water is next to the person who wears high heels).

So, the person who wears high heels lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have two houses, house 1 and house 2.
2. In house 1, we have:
   - Someone wearing sandals (Clue 1)
   - Someone eating grapes (Clue 2)
   - Someone drinking tea (Clue 3)
3. In house 2, we have:
   - Someone wearing high heels (Clue 1)
   - Someone drinking water (Clue 3)
   - Someone eating kiwis (Clue 2)

From the clues, we know:
- The person wearing sandals is in house 1.
- The person eating grapes is in house 1.
- The person drinking tea is in house 1.
- The person wearing high heels is in house 2.
- The person drinking water is in house 2.
- The person eating kiwis is in house 2.

So, the person eating kiwis lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. The tea drinker lives in house 1.
3. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
5. The violinist does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the tea drinker is in house 1. So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

Now, let's think about the cellist. The cellist can't be in house 3 because the person who only drinks water must be to the right of the cellist. So, the cellist can only be in house 2.

If the cellist is in house 2, then the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. This means the guitarist and the violinist must be in houses 2 and 3, but the violinist can't be in house 3 because there must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist. So, the violinist must be in house 2, and the guitarist must be in house 3.

So, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals. From clue 3, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house because the sandals are directly left of the person who only drinks water.

So, the arrangement is:
- Third house: Someone wearing sandals
- Fourth house: Someone who only drinks water
- Fifth house: Someone who drinks tea (Clue 4)

Now, we need to place the remaining people:
- First house: Someone who is not wearing running shoes (Clue 2)
- Second house: Someone who is not the coffee drinker or the person who is wearing loafers (Clue 5)
- First house: Someone who is wearing boots (Clue 7)
- Second house: Someone who is wearing running shoes (Clue 2)
- Fourth house: Someone who only drinks water (Clue 3)
- Fifth house: Someone who drinks tea (Clue 4)

Since the first house is occupied by someone who is wearing boots (Clue 7) and the second house is occupied by someone who is wearing running shoes (Clue 2), the only place left for the person who only drinks water is the fourth house.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the pizza is in house 4.
2. The radio is not in house 4, so it can be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.
3. The radio and computer must be separated by one house.
4. The gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.
5. The grilled cheese and spaghetti must be next to each other.
6. The grilled cheese is not in house 4.
7. The computer is not in house 4.

Let's try to place the radio and computer:

- If the radio is in house 1, the computer must be in house 2.
- If the radio is in house 2, the computer must be in house 3.
- If the radio is in house 3, the computer must be in house 4 (but house 4 is taken by pizza).
- If the radio is in house 5, the computer must be in house 4 (but house 4 is taken by pizza).

So, the radio must be in house 1 and the computer in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Computer
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Radio (already placed)

Next, the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be next to each other. Since the radio is in house 1 and the computer is in house 2, the grilled cheese and spaghetti can be in house 3 and house 4 or house 2 and house 3.

But house 4 is taken by pizza, so the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in house 2 and house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Radio (already placed)

The gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house. The gameboy can be in house 1 or house 2, but house 1 is taken by radio. So, the gameboy must be in house 2, and the fried rice must be in house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Gameboy
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Radio (already placed)

The only device left is the television. The television must be in house 5 because the phone must be to the right of the television.

Now we have:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Gameboy
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Television

The only person left is the one who ate spaghetti. Since the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be next to each other, and grilled cheese is in house 3, spaghetti must be in house 4.

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who eats a banana lives in.

1. We know the pianist lives in the third house.
2. The person who eats a banana must live somewhere to the right of the pianist, so they can't be in the first, second, or third houses. That leaves the fourth or fifth house.
3. The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
4. Since the percussionist lives in the fourth house, the person who eats a banana must be in the fifth house.

So, the person who eats a banana lives in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people who live there:

1. One person plays a percussion instrument, and the other plays a guitar.
2. One person had pizza for lunch, and the other had grilled cheese.
3. One person has a dog as a pet, and the other has a bird.

We also know:
- The person who had grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who has a bird.
- The percussionist doesn't live in the second house.

Let's figure out where each person lives:

1. Since the person who had grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who has a bird, and the second house is to the right of the first house, the person who has a bird must be in the first house, and the person who had grilled cheese must be in the second house.
2. The percussionist can't be in the second house, so the percussionist must be in the first house.
3. That leaves the guitarist and the person who had pizza to be in the second house.

So, the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have four houses, and each house has a different person living in it. Each person has a different pet, car, and sport. We need to figure out which house the bird keeper lives in based on the clues.

1. The bird keeper lives in the third house.
2. The cat lover does not live in the second house.
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
5. The baseball player does not live in the third house.
6. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
7. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
8. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives in house 3. Now let's look at the other clues:

- The cat lover cannot be in house 2.
- The golfer and the truck driver cannot be in adjacent houses.
- The convertible driver cannot be in house 1.
- The baseball player cannot be in house 3.
- The sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player.
- The soccer player cannot be in house 3.
- The fish enthusiast cannot be in house 3.
- The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player.
- The bird keeper is in house 3.

So, if the bird keeper is in house 3, the convertible driver can be in house 1 or 4. The baseball player cannot be in house 3, so they can be in house 1, 2, or 4. The sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so if the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 2.

The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player, and the soccer player must be to the left of the bird keeper (which is house 3). So, the fish enthusiast can be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 2. This means the soccer player must be in house 1.

So, the house assignments are:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."

3. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
4. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
5. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.

From clue 6, we know the person eating grapes is in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

From clue 5, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

From clue 4, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts clue 6, which says the person eating grapes is in house 2. So, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: ?
- House 4: Yellow

From clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white is in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana is in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: White
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: ?
- House 4: Yellow

From clue 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes red must be in house 2. This contradicts clue 6, which says the person eating grapes is in house 2. So, the person who likes red must be in house 3, and the person who likes green must be in house 1. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Yellow

From clue 1, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's think through the clues step by step to figure out where the person who had stew lives.

1. The person wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person eating oranges.
   - This means if the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
   - If the person eating oranges is in house 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 3 (but there is no house 3, so this is not possible).

2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the cat lover.

3. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 1, we know the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

From clue 2, the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, and from clue 3, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must also be in adjacent houses.

Let's place the person eating stew in house 1 (since the person eating stew must be next to the mystery book reader, and the mystery book reader must be next to the cat lover).

If the person eating stew is in house 1, then the person who had stew must be in house 2 (since they are next to each other).

Now, the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes is in house 2.

The only remaining house is house 3, which must be for the cat lover and the person who ate fried rice. Since the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be adjacent, and the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are adjacent, the only way to fit all these clues is:

- House 1: Person eating stew
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes
- House 3: Cat lover and person eating fried rice

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person eating stew (in house 1) is next to the mystery book reader (in house 2).
- The mystery book reader (in house 2) is next to the cat lover (in house 3).
- The person wearing running shoes (in house 2) is next to the person eating stew (in house 1).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes milk lives by following the clues step by step.

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
3. The root beer lover lives in the first house.
4. The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1. So, house 1 is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. So, house 2 is occupied by the person who only drinks water.

From Clue 4, the person who has a television does not live in house 2. So, the person who has a television must live in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a television lives in house 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in house 2. But we already know the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in house 1, but we already know the root beer lover lives in house 1. This means the person who has a vase of tulips must live in house 3.

So, house 1 is occupied by the root beer lover, house 2 is occupied by the person who only drinks water, and house 3 is occupied by the person who has a vase of tulips.

Now, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who only drinks water lives in house 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1, and the person who has a phone must live in house 3.

So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 3.

The person who likes milk must live in the remaining house, which is house 3.

So, the person who likes milk lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person with the computer lives by looking at the clues again.

1. The person wearing loafers lives in the first house.
2. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos.
3. The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person drinking water.
4. The person wearing boots does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person drinking milk.
6. The person wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person with a gameboy.
7. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.

We know:
- House 1: Wearing loafers
- House 2: Phone, Boots, Gameboy
- House 3: Mangos, Milk, Kiwis

From clue 3, grapes and water must be in adjacent houses. Since grapes can be in House 1 or 2, and water must be in House 2 or 3, we can deduce:
- If grapes are in House 1, water must be in House 2.
- If grapes are in House 2, water must be in House 3.

From clue 5, kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses. Since kiwis can be in House 2 or 3, and milk must be in House 2 or 3, we can deduce:
- If kiwis are in House 2, milk must be in House 3.
- If kiwis are in House 3, milk must be in House 2.

From clue 6, boots must be to the right of the gameboy. This means:
- If boots are in House 2, gameboy must be in House 1.
- If boots are in House 3, gameboy must be in House 2.

From clue 7, kiwis cannot be in House 1. So, kiwis must be in House 2 or 3.

Let's try different placements:

1. **If kiwis are in House 2:**
   - Kiwis: House 2
   - Milk: House 3
   - Gameboy: House 1
   - Phone: House 2 (but this is a contradiction because phone must be left of mangos)

2. **If kiwis are in House 3:**
   - Kiwis: House 3
   - Milk: House 2
   - Gameboy: House 2
   - Phone: House 1

This fits all the clues:
- House 1: Wearing loafers
- House 2: Phone, Boots, Gameboy
- House 3: Mangos, Milk, Kiwis

So, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person eating oranges lives in house 1.
2. The person driving a truck and the person driving a convertible live next to each other.
3. The person eating mangos does not live in house 3.
4. The person owning horses lives in house 3.
5. The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible live next to each other.

From clue 5, we know:
- House 3: Owning horses.

- House 1: Eating oranges.

From clue 4, we know:
- House 3: Not eating mangos.

From clue 6, we know:
- The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible live next to each other.

So, the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in houses 1 and 2. Since house 1 is eating oranges, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2.

Now, we need to place the bird keeper and the dog owner. From clue 3, the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are 2 and 3, but house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses. Therefore, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 1.

Since house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3. But house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses, so the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 1.

So, the only remaining house for the person driving a truck is house 2.

"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the primary school level education persona.

1. We know the person who likes green lives in house 3. So, house 3 is for green.
2. The percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other. They can't be in house 1 or 5 because there's only one house between them.
3. The person who has a television lives next to the person who likes red.
4. There's one house between the guitarist and the person who likes yellow.
5. There are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist.
6. The person who has a phone lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
7. The person who likes green lives in house 3.
8. The percussionist lives next to the person who likes white.
9. The person who likes red doesn't live in house 2.
10. The person who has a radio lives in house 3.
11. The person who has a computer doesn't live in house 2.
12. The person who has a computer lives next to the person who has a phone.

Let's fill in the houses step by step:

- House 3: Green (already known)
- House 2: Red (since the percussionist and guitarist are next to each other, and the percussionist lives next to the person who likes white, and the person who likes red can't be in house 2)
- House 1: Guitarist (next to the percussionist)
- House 4: Cellist (since the cellist can't be in house 5 and the cellist is two houses away from the percussionist)
- House 5: Violinist (since the violinist is two houses away from the percussionist)
- House 6: Saxophonist (since the saxophonist is the only one left)

So, the saxophonist lives in house 6.

The correct answer is (B) 6."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

1. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

From Clue 1, we know the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2 because the cellist has to be to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2. This is because the history book buff has to be to the left of the cat lover.

From Clue 3, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the cellist is already in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1 and the guitarist must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

The person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's think about the houses and the clues one by one to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a different pet and a different flower arrangement. We know the following:

1. The person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner is not in the second house.
3. The person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner.

Let's start by considering the dog owner. The dog owner can't be in the second house, so they can only be in the first or the third house.

### Case 1: Dog owner in house 1
- If the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper can't be in house 1 (because the carnations must be to the right of the bird keeper).
- So, the bird keeper must be in house 2.
- Now, the carnations must be in house 3 (because the carnations are to the right of the bird keeper).
- This means the person with tulips must be in house 3 (because the tulips are to the right of the dog owner, and the dog owner is in house 1).

So, if the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with tulips is in house 3.

### Case 2: Dog owner in house 3
- If the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper can't be in house 3 (because the carnations must be to the right of the bird keeper).
- So, the bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2.
- If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 2 (because the carnations are to the right of the bird keeper).
- This means the person with tulips must be in house 2 (because the tulips are to the right of the dog owner, and the dog owner is in house 3).

So, if the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper is in house 1, and the person with tulips is in house 2.

From the above two cases, we can see that the person with the vase of tulips can only be in house 2 or house 3. But we need to check which one fits all the clues.

### Checking the first case:
- Dog owner in house 1
- Bird keeper in house 2
- Tulips in house 3
- Carnations in house 3 (which fits the clue)

### Checking the second case:
- Dog owner in house 3
- Bird keeper in house 1
- Tulips in house 2
- Carnations in house 2 (which fits the clue)

Both cases fit the clues, but we need to pick one. The question asks for the house number where the person with the vase of tulips lives. From the clues, the most straightforward and fitting scenario is the second case where the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper is in house 1, and the person with tulips is in house 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person wearing sandals lives. We know the following:

1. The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
2. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
3. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
4. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.

So, the order must be:
- Person wearing sandals
- Person with phone
- Person eating oranges
- Person with computer

This means the person wearing sandals lives in House 1, the person with phone lives in House 2, the person eating oranges lives in House 3, and the person with computer lives in House 4.

Therefore, the person wearing sandals lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has mangos.

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - So, horses are not in the first house.

3. The bird keeper and the person who eats kiwis live next to each other.
   - This means they are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. The person who eats a banana does not live in the third house.
   - So, the banana is not in the third house.

5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - So, horses are not in the second house.

6. The person who eats a banana lives next to the dog owner.
   - This means if the banana is in house 1, the dog owner is in house 2, or if the banana is in house 2, the dog owner is in house 1 or 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Eating mangos, not horses, not banana, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses.

Since the person eating a banana cannot be in house 3, the only place for the banana is house 1. So, the dog owner must be in house 2.

This means:
- House 1: Eating mangos, not horses, not banana, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses.

Since the person eating a banana is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 3 (because they must be next to each other).

So, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 4. The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Mystery book reader

2. The bird keeper and the history book buff live next to each other.
   - So, they can be in houses 2 and 3.

3. The romance book lover cannot be in the third house.
   - So, the romance book lover must be in the second house.

4. The person who owns horses cannot be in the third house.
   - Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Person who owns horses

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in the second house.

The answer is: (B) 2"
"Let's think through the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person eating apples lives next to the person drinking water, and the apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
3. The person eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating apples lives next to the tea drinker.
6. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

Now, let's use clue 2. The apple eater and the water drinker must be next to each other, and the apple eater is to the left of the water drinker. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 3, the mangos eater cannot be in house 1 or house 3. So, the mangos eater must be in house 4.

From clue 6, the kiwi eater cannot be in house 3. So, the kiwi eater must be in house 1 or house 4. But since the mangos eater is in house 4, the kiwi eater must be in house 1.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwi eater
- House 4: Mangos eater
- House 2: Coffee drinker (from clue 1)
- House 3: Apple eater

The apple eater and the water drinker must be next to each other, and the apple eater is to the left of the water drinker. So, the apple eater must be in house 3 and the water drinker must be in house 4. But we already know the mangos eater is in house 4, so the water drinker must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwi eater
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Apple eater
- House 4: Water drinker

The coffee drinker lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating bananas lives.

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who likes green.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. This means the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes green, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes green, which is a contradiction. So, let's recheck the clues.

From clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, and the golfer must be to the left of the cricketer, the golfer must live in the first house, and the cricketer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the person who likes white (house 2) lives directly left of the person who likes red (house 4). Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who likes red must live in house 1.

From clue 3, the person who likes white (house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who likes white (house 2) lives and where the person who is eating apples (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From clue 6, the cricketer (house 4) does not live in the fifth house, which is consistent.

From clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis (house 2) and the person who is eating a banana (house 3) live directly next to each other, which is consistent.

So, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."

6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. So, the second house is:

- Soccer Player

From clue 1, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. This means the person who had stew cannot be in the first house, and the person who is wearing high heels cannot be in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. This means the person who had stew cannot be in the third house, and the person who had stew must be in the first or second house.

From clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in the third house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in the first house, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the mystery book reader does not live in the second house. This means the mystery book reader can live in the first or third house.

From clue 3, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the golfer cannot be in the first house, and the golfer must be in the third house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the first house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement is:

- First House: Rose Bouquet
- Second House: Soccer Player
- Third House: Stew

The person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first house because the first house is already taken by the rose bouquet.

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, thinking like someone with primary school education.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. One person plays the flute, one plays the percussion, and one plays the cello.
2. One person wears boots, one wears high heels, and one wears loafers.
3. One person has a gameboy, one has a phone, and one has a TV.
4. One person drives a convertible, one drives a minivan, and one drives a truck.

We also have some clues:

1. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. The person who wears high heels and the person who has a TV live directly next to each other.
5. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. The person who wears boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's try to figure out where each person lives based on these clues.

First, let's look at Clue 6: The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the flutist and the minivan driver must be in houses 1 and 2.

Now, let's look at Clue 5: The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck. So, the truck driver must be in house 1, and the minivan driver must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Truck driver
- House 2: Minivan driver
- House 3: Flutist

Now, let's use Clue 2: The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since the truck driver is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2. But house 2 is already taken by the minivan driver. So, the gameboy must be in house 3.

Now, let's use Clue 4: The person who wears high heels and the person who has a TV live directly next to each other. Since the person with the TV is in house 3, the person who wears high heels must be in house 2. But house 2 is already taken by the minivan driver. So, the person who wears high heels must be in house 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Person who wears high heels
- House 2: Minivan driver
- House 3: Flutist

Since the person who wears high heels is in house 1, the percussionist must be in house 3 (because the flutist is in house 3 and the percussionist must be somewhere else).

So, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to find out where the person eating apples lives.

1. The person eating grapes lives in house 5.
2. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.

10. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist.
11. The violinist and the person eating oranges live directly next to each other.
12. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
13. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.

From clue 6, we know the person eating grapes lives in house 5.

From clue 5, the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

From clue 4, the person with a television lives in house 3.

From clue 10, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

From clue 12, the person eating oranges lives in house 3 (since the person with a television lives in house 3 and the person eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist).

From clue 11, the violinist and the person eating oranges live directly next to each other. Since the person eating oranges is in house 3, the violinist must be in house 2.

From clue 13, the person eating oranges (in house 3) lives directly left of the saxophonist. So, the saxophonist must be in house 4.

From clue 7, the person with a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in house 4, the person with a gameboy must be in house 3 and the guitarist must be in house 5.

From clue 8, the person with a phone lives directly left of the person with a radio. Since the person with a television is in house 3, the person with a phone must be in house 2 and the person with a radio must be in house 1.

So, the house where the person eating apples lives is house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The person with the lilies bouquet lives in the second house.
2. The person with the SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
3. The person with the SUV lives in the first house.
4. The person with the truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
5. The person with the truck lives somewhere to the right of the person with the minivan.
6. The person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.

From clue 2 and clue 3, we know:
- The person with the SUV lives in the first house.
- The person with the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 6, the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house because the coffee drinker is directly left of the rose bouquet person.

So, the first house has the person with the rose bouquet, the second house has the person with the lilies bouquet, and the third house has the person with the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person who drives a truck lives step by step.

1. The person who likes blue lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
2. The person who had stew lives next to the person who has lilies.
3. The person who has a rose lives next to the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who had stew lives next to the person who drives a minivan.
5. The person who likes red doesn't live in the first house.
6. The person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who has daffodils.

Let's start with clue 4: The person who had stew lives next to the person who drives a minivan. This means if the person who had stew is in house 1, the minivan person must be in house 2, and if the person who had stew is in house 2, the minivan person must be in house 3.

Now, clue 6 says the person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who has daffodils. So, if the minivan person is in house 2, the daffodils person must be in house 3, and if the minivan person is in house 3, the daffodils person must be in house 2.

Let's use clue 3: The person who has a rose lives next to the person who drives a truck. This means if the person who has a rose is in house 1, the truck person must be in house 2, and if the person who has a rose is in house 2, the truck person must be in house 3.

Now, clue 1: The person who likes blue lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. If the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, and if the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1.

From clue 5: The person who likes red doesn't live in the first house. So, the person who likes red must be in house 2 or house 3.

Let's put it all together:
- If the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3. But then the person who likes red can't be in house 2 (because the person who likes blue is in house 1), and the person who likes red can't be in house 3 (because the person who likes blue is in house 1). This doesn't work.
- If the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1. The person who likes red can't be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue is in house 2), and the person who likes red can't be in house 3 (because the person who likes blue is in house 2). So, the person who likes red must be in house 3. This works.

So, the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti is in house 1, the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who has a rose is in house 1, the person who drives a minivan is in house 2, and the person who drives a truck is in house 3.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
3. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
5. The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
6. The soccer player lives in the second house.
7. The flutist lives in the third house.
8. The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
10. The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other.
11. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house.
12. The person who likes green does not live in the third house.
13. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
14. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
15. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. From clue 8, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. From clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first, third, or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. From clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. From clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

Now, let's summarize the known information:
- Second house: Flutist
- Third house: Cellist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV (and also the person who likes white)

Since the sedan owner cannot be in the second house (clue 15) and the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must be in the first house.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have 3 houses: House 1, House 2, and House 3.
2. We know the following:
   - House 3 has a gameboy.
   - House 2 has a red device.
   - House 1 has white.
   - House 3 has grapes.
   - There is one house between where the person who eats apples lives and where the person who wears sandals lives.
   - The person who has a phone lives next to the person who wears running shoes.
   - The person who likes white lives next to the person who eats grapes.

Now, let's figure out where each person lives:

- House 3 has a gameboy, so it can't have the person who eats apples or the person who wears sandals.
- House 2 has a red device, so it can't have the person who eats apples or the person who wears sandals.
- House 1 has white, so it can't have the person who eats apples or the person who wears sandals.

Since there is one house between where the person who eats apples lives and where the person who wears sandals lives, and House 3 has a gameboy, the person who eats apples must be in House 1 and the person who wears sandals must be in House 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: White (likes white)
- House 2: Red (likes red)
- House 3: Gameboy (has a gameboy)
- House 4: Sandals (wears sandals)

Now, we need to place the person who eats grapes and the person who has a phone. Since the person who eats grapes lives next to the person who likes red, and the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who eats grapes must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, so the person who eats grapes must be in House 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: White (likes white)
- House 2: Red (likes red)
- House 3: Gameboy (has a gameboy) and grapes (eats grapes)
- House 4: Sandals (wears sandals)

Now, the person who has a phone must be next to the person who wears running shoes. The person who wears running shoes must be in House 2, so the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

So, the person who has a phone lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

From clue 8, the bird keeper (house 2) must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (house 4). So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4.

From clue 9, the person who owns horses lives in house number 4, which is correct since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 4: Person who owns horses

From clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the bouquet of lilies cannot be in house 4.

From clue 3, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist. This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the person who had pizza cannot be in house 1.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. This means the violinist and the person with the rose bouquet must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the dog owner must be in house 3, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti (house 4) must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1). This is already satisfied.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1) must be to the left of the guitarist (house 1), which is a contradiction. So, we need to re-evaluate the placement.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Person who has a vase of tulips
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who owns horses

So, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person eating grapes are next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1. But we already know the saxophonist is in house 1, so this is a contradiction. This means the person eating grapes must be in house 1, and the baseball player must be in house 2.

From clue 2, the saxophonist and the golfer are next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2.

From clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer are next to each other. Since the golfer is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Saxophonist, Romance book lover
- House 2: Golfer, Person eating grapes

Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From clue 10, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. This"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:
1. The person with the lilies doesn't live in the second house.
2. The person with the high heels doesn't live in the second house.
3. The person with boots lives in the first house.
4. The person with daffodils lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person with boots lives in the first house. And from clue 4, we know the person with daffodils also lives in the first house. So, the first house is taken by both the person with daffodils and the person with boots.

This means the second house can't have the person with daffodils or the person with boots. So, the second house must have the person with the lilies.

That leaves the third house for the person with the high heels.

So, the person with boots lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 5 houses numbered 1 to 5.
2. Each house has a person with different characteristics.
3. We need to figure out where the tea drinker lives.

Here are the clues again:
1. The coffee drinker does not live in the fourth house.
2. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
3. The basketball player and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
4. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
6. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
8. The person who only drinks water does not live in the fifth house.
9. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
10. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
11. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
13. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.
14. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing boots. They must be in the first house because the basketball player must be directly left of them.

1. House 1: Person wearing boots
2. House 2: Basketball player

Next, the root beer lover must be in the fourth house because they must be directly left of the person wearing high heels.

3. House 4: Root beer lover
4. House 3: Person wearing high heels

Now, the basketball player and the tennis player must be next to each other. They can be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But since the root beer lover is in house 4, the basketball player must be in house 3 and the tennis player in house 2.

5. House 2: Basketball player
6. House 3: Tennis player

The cricketer must be to the right of the person wearing sandals. The only place left for the cricketer is house 5.

7. House 5: Cricketer

The person who only drinks water must be to the left of the tea drinker. The only place left for the person who only drinks water is house 4, but it can't be there because the root beer lover is there. So, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

8. House 1: Person who only drinks water

The cricketer must be to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. The only place left for the person who is wearing sandals is house 4.

9. House 4: Person who is wearing sandals
10. House 5: Cricketer

Now, the person who had stew must be to the left of the tennis player. The only place left for the person who had stew is house 3.

11. House 3: Person who had stew

The person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who is wearing loafers. The only place left for the person who ate spaghetti is house 2.

12. House 2: Person who ate spaghetti
13. House 1: Person who only drinks water

So, the tea drinker must be in house 1.

The tea drinker lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following:
- One person likes red, and the other likes yellow.
- One person is eating oranges, and the other is eating grapes.
- One person likes mystery books, and the other likes fantasy books.
- One person drives a truck, and the other drives a convertible.
- One person wears boots, and the other wears running shoes.

We also have these clues:
1. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- So, if Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

But Clue 1 tells us:
- The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.

This creates a contradiction because Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow and eat grapes at the same time. So, Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow.

Therefore, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

Now, since Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

From Clue 1 again:
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.

Since Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

From Clue 2:
- The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
- If Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, then Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.
- If Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, then Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.

Since Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader, Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.

So, we have:
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots and likes red.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes and likes yellow.
- Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the fantasy book reader.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

- The violinist lives in the second house.
- The basketball player lives in the second house.
- The cricketer lives in the first house.
- The cellist lives in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player also lives in the second house, and the violinist is already in the second house, the basketball player must be the one who plays basketball.

This leaves the soccer player to live in the first house.

So, the soccer player lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the primary school level education persona.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Stew

The person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person with pizza (house 4) lives directly left of the person with spaghetti, and the person with pizza lives in house 4, the person with spaghetti must be in house 5. The person with stew (house 5) lives directly left of the person with pizza, so the person with stew lives in house 4.

Since the person with pizza (house 4) lives directly left of the person with spaghetti (house 5), and the person with pizza lives in house 4, the person with spaghetti must be in house 5. The person with stew (house 5) lives directly left of the person with pizza, so the person with stew lives in house 4.

The person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in a house number greater than house 4, and the person with a computer must be in a house number greater than the person with a bouquet of daffodils. The only house left for the person with a computer is house 5.

So, the person with a computer lives in house 5.

The correct answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person in house 1 is wearing high heels and is a cat lover.
2. The person in house 2 is wearing boots.
3. The person in house 3 is wearing running shoes (we need to find this).
4. The person in house 3 owns a sedan.
5. The person in house 1 owns an SUV.
6. The person in house 2 owns an SUV (but we already know house 1 owns an SUV, so this is a mistake in the clue).

So, let's put it together:

- House 1: High Heels (Cat Lover)
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Sedan (Running Shoes)

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the tea drinker lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the first house because the person who likes blue is next to the person who is eating kiwis.
3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live next to each other.
4. The person who has carnations lives in the first house.
5. The person who has tulips lives in the second house.
6. The person who likes green lives in the first house because the person who likes green is next to the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Person who likes green
- House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live next to each other, and the only house left for the person who likes milk is House 3, the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

So, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. Each house has a different person living in it.
3. Each person likes a different kind of book: mystery, science fiction, and history.
4. Each person has a different device: computer, television, and phone.

We have these clues:
1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader is in the first house. So, the first house is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (MR)

From clue 1, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. So, the history book buff must be in the second house:
- House 2: History book buff (HBB)

Now, we know the first house is MR and the second house is HBB. From clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Since MR is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is HBB. So, the person with the television must be in the third house.

Now we know:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: HBB (history book buff)
- House 3: TV (television)

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person with the television is in the third house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. So, the person with the phone is MR (mystery book reader).

This leaves the person with the computer. Since the person with the phone is MR, the person with the computer must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is HBB. So, the person with the computer must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: HBB (history book buff)
- House 3: TV (television)

The person who has the computer is in the third house. The person who has the phone is in the first house. The person who has the television is in the second house.

The science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house because the first and second houses are taken by the mystery book reader and the history book buff, respectively.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"No, a person with St. Vitus's Dance is not likely to win a ballet competition. St. Vitus's Dance causes jerky, uncontrolled movements, which are hard to control and perform in a ballet. Ballet requires smooth, precise movements, so someone with these uncontrollable movements would have a hard time performing well."
"No, it's not impossible for pigs to use pig Latin. Pigs can't understand or use human languages like pig Latin, but they can be trained to do certain things. So, they can't speak pig Latin, but they can be taught to do tasks."

"The correct answer is (A) No.

Brown rock fish are not usually found in the waters around Saint Kitts and Nevis. These fish like colder waters and are more common in places like the North Atlantic.

"Growing seedless cucumber might not be good for a gardener with entomophobia because seedless cucumbers need insects to help them grow. If the gardener is scared of insects, they might feel more comfortable with regular cucumbers that don't need insect help. So, the answer is (B) No."
"To figure out if Martin Luther would run out of theses in half a year, let's think about it step by step.

Half a year is about 182 days. If Martin Luther wrote one thesis every day, he would write a thesis each day for 182 days. That means he would have written 182 theses in 182 days.

On the 183rd day, he would have written his 183rd thesis.

So, Martin Luther would not run out of theses in half a year. He would have 182 theses by the end of 182 days, and he would have his 183rd thesis on the 183rd day.

The answer is:
(B) No"
"The question is a bit confusing because ""slam dance"" isn't a common dance style. If we're talking about waltz and a dance that might be more energetic, waltz is usually less injurious. Waltz involves slow, graceful movements that are generally safe. A more energetic dance might be slam dance, but we don't know what that means exactly. So, if we assume waltz is less injurious, the answer would be:

(A) No"
"No, a 1943-S penny would not be good for making silverware. Silverware is made of silver, not copper-nickel alloy like the 1943-S penny. The 1943-S penny is a historical coin and not a material that can be used to make silverware."
"Yes, it would be very difficult to snowboard on Venus. Venus is a very hot planet with a thick atmosphere that is mostly made of carbon dioxide.

So, mentioning her story can help people understand what PTSD is and how it affects people."
"Jack Black is an actor and singer, and Bear McCreary is a composer. They work in different fields, so it's unlikely that Jack Black would compete with Bear McCreary for an award. So the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"No, not all cucumbers are the same texture. Some cucumbers can be very crunchy, like the ones you might find in a salad. But some cucumbers can be softer and more watery, like the ones you might find in a drink. So, the texture can be different."
"B

Rick and Morty is a funny cartoon show for grown-ups. It has silly jokes and talks about big ideas. It doesn't usually talk about families where someone drinks too much grown-up stuff.

Other things like listening to music or playing games can also make you feel happy and excited."
"Let's think about this like we're talking to a primary school student.

Apollo is a god from Greek stories, and D'Artagnan is a character from a book. In Greek stories, gods are very powerful and can do amazing things. But in the book, D'Artagnan is a brave and strong person who fights with swords.

If we imagine these characters fighting, it's hard to say who would win. The god might be very powerful, but D'Artagnan is also very strong. So, it's not clear who would win.

So, the best answer is:

(A) No

This means we can't say for sure that all of Apollo's would defeat all of D'Artagnan's. It's like asking if all the superheroes in one story could beat all the villains in another story. We just don't know!"

The answer is: (B) No"

So, they are more likely to break bones easily."

So, the answer is:

"Yes, some mental disorders can be hidden. People with mental disorders might not show obvious signs to others, so they might not be noticed.

"Yes, Paul Bunyan would be a poor choice for an urban planner. Here’s why:

Paul Bunyan is known for being very big and strong, like being as tall as a house and having a big axe. But being big and strong doesn't help much in making cities better. An urban planner needs to know how to make roads, build houses, and keep the city clean. Paul Bunyan can't do those things. He can't build roads with his big axe or make sure there are enough houses for people to live in. So, Paul Bunyan wouldn't be good at being an urban planner."

"Based on the information given, Iris is a messenger of the gods and can move very fast, while Hermes is a messenger of the gods who is also known for being a bit tricky and resourceful.

Hermes might have a harder time with the more routine tasks like organizing packages and talking to customers, but he could still do okay. So, they might not struggle much together, but Hermes might have a harder time with the more boring parts of the job.

"Lactic acid is not bad for your body. It's a normal thing that happens when you exercise and your muscles don't get enough oxygen.

Your body can usually get rid of the lactic acid, and it helps your muscles work better. So, having lactic acid in your body is not bad, it's just a normal part of how your body works when you're active."
"The Gunpowder Plot was a plan to blow up King James I and the English nobles. Mary, Queen of Scots, was a Catholic and was in England at the time. She was accused of being involved in the plot.

So, it's hard to say which bite hurts worse. Both can hurt a lot, but a bull shark bite might hurt a little bit more because of how strong they are.

The Samsung Galaxy A10e has only 32GB of storage. Even if we assume each episode of Game of Thrones is 1 hour long and in HD, it would take a lot of space. There are 16 seasons, and each season has around 10-12 episodes. So, that's about 160-192 hours of video. Since 1 hour of HD video is about 5GB, it would take 500-600GB of storage.

A sofer is someone who writes or inspects the writing of Torah scrolls. Torah scrolls are very important in Jewish religious practice. To make these scrolls, they use special paper called parchment, which is made from animal skin. They also use ink that might have gelatin in it, which is a protein found in animal skin and bones.

Now, a vegan diet means not eating any animal products or by-products. This includes things like meat, dairy, eggs, and sometimes gelatin.

1. **Health Risk**: Door-to-door canvassing involves close contact with people, which can spread the virus, especially if the person being approached is older or has health problems.
