Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with the flutes lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent, and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the carnations and the bouquet of lilies must be adjacent, and the person with the carnations must be to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.
   - Since the flutist lives in house number 2, the pianist must live in either house number 3 or house number 4.

Let's consider the possible positions for the pianist:

### Case 1: Pianist lives in house number 3
- If the pianist lives in house number 3, then the guitarist must live in house number 2 (since the flutist is already in house number 2), which contradicts the fact that the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips. Therefore, the pianist cannot live in house number 3.

### Case 2: Pianist lives in house number 4
- If the pianist lives in house number 4, then the guitarist must live in house number 3 (since the flutist is in house number 2 and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips).

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- The person with the bouquet of lilies must be to the left of the person with the carnations arrangement.
- The person with the vase of tulips must be to the left of the guitarist (house number 3).

Let's place the remaining flowers and instruments:

- The person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house number 1 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).
- The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 4 (since house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist and house number 4 is occupied by the pianist).

This leaves house number 1 for the person with the bouquet of lilies and house number 4 for the person with the carnations arrangement. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 2 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).

Thus, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **House 1:** The person who is eating kiwis.
2. **House 2:** The person who likes green.
3. **House 3:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy (they live next to each other).

### Clue Analysis

### Initial Setup

- **House 1:** The person who is eating kiwis.
- **House 2:** The person who likes green.
- **House 3:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy (they live next to each other).

### Clue 5
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
  - House 1: Green.

### Clue 6
- The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
  - This means the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

### Clue 7
- The percussionist does not live in the second house.
  - This means the percussionist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

### Clue 4
- There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
  - This means the cellist and the person with a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, this is not possible).

### Clue 3
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
  - This means the person who only drinks water must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

### Clue 2
- The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
  - This means the person who has a television must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

### Clue 1
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
  - This means the root beer lover must be to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

### Combining Clues

Given Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3.

### Final Arrangement

- **House 1:** Green (person who likes green)
- **House 2:** Blue (person who likes blue) and Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)
- **House 3:** Root beer (person who drinks root beer) and Kiwis (person who eats kiwis)

Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3, and the person who drinks root beer must be to the left of the person who drinks root beer, the only possible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** Green
- **House 2:** Blue, Gameboy
- **House 3:** Root beer, Kiwis

Thus, the cellist must live in house 3.

"Given the clues and the logical deductions, we can determine the house where the tea drinker lives as follows:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
3. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
4. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

11. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
12. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in the third house is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The person who had pizza must be in house 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 3.
- The person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(A) 2**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's summarize and analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - This directly tells us that the grilled cheese eater lives in house number 5.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in one of the houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the root beer lover and the person who had stew are neighbors, with the root beer lover being to the left of the person who had stew.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house number 5.

5. **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who ate spaghetti are neighbors, with the coffee drinker being to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors.

From Clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives in house number 5. From Clue 1, we know the person who ate grilled cheese also lives in house number 5. This leaves house number 1, 2, and 4 for the remaining characteristics.

From Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 3. This leaves houses 1, 2, and 4 for the person who had stew, the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover.

From Clue 3, the root beer lover and the person who had stew are neighbors, with the root beer lover being to the left of the person who had stew. This means the root beer lover must be in house 1 and the person who had stew in house 2.

From Clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the person who likes milk.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who likes milk
- House 5: Person who only drinks water (and also the person who ate grilled cheese)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The correct answer is (A) 5."

Given that the person with daffodils must be to the right of the person eating oranges, and the soccer player and the person eating oranges are in houses 1 and 2, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 and the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

### Combining Clue 2:
- The swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2.
- Since the person with daffodils is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1.

### Combining Clue 3:
- The person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.
- The person eating mangos must be in house 1 (since the swimmer is in house 1 and the person with daffodils is in house 2).

Thus, the person eating mangos must be in house 1, and the person with tulips must be in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person with daffodils
- House 3: Person with tulips

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions of the people in the houses:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The history book buff lives in House 3.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
5. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a radio lives one house away from the history book buff.
8. The person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist.

From these constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Violinist (ate spaghetti)
- House 3: History book buff (ate fried rice)
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone (must be next to each other)

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist, and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 (which is a contradiction since the violinist is already there). Therefore, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2, and the person with a phone must be in House 3.

This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips.

Thus, the person with a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the person who lives in the second house (Clue 2). This person is the mystery book reader.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Next, we use Clue 3 and Clue 6 to place the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast. The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the history book buff. The history book buff must be directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in House 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 5 to place the percussionist. The percussionist must be directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the computer must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the person who has a gameboy. The person who has a gameboy must be directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Finally, we use Clue 8 to place the cellist. The cellist cannot be in House 3. Since the cellist is not in House 3, the cellist must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy is in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the rose bouquet is in House 3, the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person wearing boots lives in house 2.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person driving a convertible must live in house 1 (since the convertible driver must be directly left of the history book buff, and the history book buff cannot be in house 1).

Therefore, the person driving a truck must live in house 2 (since the person driving a truck is the only other car type left).

Now, let's assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is not wearing boots, so they must be wearing sandals.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is not wearing boots, so they must be wearing boots.
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is not a history book buff, so they must be a mystery book reader.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is a history book buff.

Thus, the person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step.

1. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
4. **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From Clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

Now, let's use the other clues to determine the remaining houses:

- **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.
- **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in either the first or third house.
- **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. This means the history book buff cannot live in the first house, and the person who is wearing loafers cannot live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the remaining people:

1. The third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
2. The person wearing high heels cannot be in the second house, so they must be in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
3. The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (second house) must be to the right of each other. This means the person wearing loafers must be in the fourth house.
4. The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the first and fourth houses are occupied, the only remaining houses are the second and third. The person wearing sandals must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing high heels
- Second house: Person wearing sandals
- Third house: Mystery book reader
- Fourth house: Person wearing loafers

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct option is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

From Clue 5, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's summarize the information we have so far:
- The third house is occupied by the root beer lover.
- The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
- The tea drinker is not in the second house.

Let's try to place the people based on the clues:

1. The root beer lover is in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker is not in the second house.

If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers step by step:

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (House 1).**
   - This means the person in House 1 likes green and has a radio.

2. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house (House 1).**
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in House 2.

3. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house (House 1).**
   - This means the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

4. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - Since the person who likes green lives in House 2, the person who has a radio must live in House 1.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who likes green (in House 1) and the person who had pizza (in House 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in House 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in House 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in House 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in House 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in House 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Based on the given clues and the deduced arrangement, the person who only drinks water lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The flutist lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
9. **Clue 10:** The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
12. **Clue 13:** The cat lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, we can write:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 1, 3, or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis.

From Clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2 or 4.

From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts Clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2 or 4.

Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2. The person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who likes milk must live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 4.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start by placing the grilled cheese and pizza based on Clue 6 and Clue 4:

- **Grilled cheese** and **pizza** must be adjacent, and **grilled cheese** and **stew** must be adjacent. This means the possible pairs are (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4) or (4, 5).

Given Clue 8, grilled cheese and tulips must be adjacent, and Clue 7, grilled cheese must be to the right of spaghetti. This narrows down the possible positions for grilled cheese.

Let's try placing grilled cheese in house 1:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Spaghetti (since grilled cheese must be to the right of spaghetti)
- House 4: Stew (since grilled cheese and stew must be adjacent)
- House 5: Tulips (since grilled cheese and tulips must be adjacent)

Now, we need to place the remaining fruits and flowers:
- **Oranges** and **apples** must be adjacent, and **oranges** must be to the right of **apples**.
- **Oranges** and **kiwis** must be two houses apart.
- **Oranges** and **carnations** must be adjacent.
- **Apples** and **mangos** must be adjacent.

Given the positions:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Tulips

We can place the remaining fruits and flowers:
- **Oranges** and **apples** must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- **Oranges** and **kiwis** must be two houses apart.
- **Oranges** and **carnations** must be adjacent.
- **Apples** and **mangos** must be adjacent.

Let's try placing **oranges** in house 2 and **apples** in house 3:
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: Apples
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Tulips

This leaves house 1 for **grilled cheese**, house 2 for **oranges**, house 3 for **apples**, house 4 for **stew**, and house 5 for **tulips**.

Now, we need to place **kiwis** and **carnations**:
- **Kiwis** must be two houses apart from **oranges** (house 2), so **kiwis** must be in house 4 or 5.
- **Carnations** must be adjacent to **oranges** (house 2).

Given the positions:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: Apples
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Tulips

**Kiwis** must be in house 4, and **carnations** must be in house 2.

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's reanalyze the houses and their occupants step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner lives in house \(X\), the tulip owner lives in house \(X-1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the daffodils owner cannot live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the carnations owner lives in house \(X+1\) or \(X-1\).

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the lilies owner lives in house \(X+1\) or higher.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover lives in house 1.

Given the cat lover lives in house 1, we can start filling in the houses:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Daffodils (from Clue 2)
- House 3: Horse (from Clue 4, since the lilies owner must be to the right of the horse owner)
- House 4: Dog (from Clue 1, since the tulip owner must be to the left of the dog owner)
- House 5: Fish (remaining pet)

Now, let's verify the remaining clues:

- **Clue 1:** The tulip owner lives in house 4, and the dog owner lives in house 5.
- **Clue 2:** The daffodils owner lives in house 2.
- **Clue 3:** The horse owner lives in house 3, and the carnations owner lives in house 4 (which is consistent with the dog owner living in house 5).
- **Clue 4:** The lilies owner lives in house 4 (which is consistent with the dog owner living in house 5).
- **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in house 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast must live in house 5.

However, since the options provided are (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 1, (D) 4, and house 5 is not an option, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the options. Based on the given clues and logical deductions, the correct answer should be house 5.

Given the options, the closest correct answer is:

\(\boxed{D}\)"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers step by step:

   - This means the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Has a phone.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Does not wear boots.

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone (Clue 1), the person in house 2 must be wearing boots (since the person in house 2 does not wear boots). Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Now, let's determine the pets and devices:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 cannot have a phone (because the person in house 1 has a phone), the person in house 1 must own horses. The person in house 2 must have a radio.

So, the characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

From Clue 8, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow must live in the third house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who has a phone must live in the third house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a computer lives in the first house, the person who has a phone must live in the third house.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people and their pets in the houses. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Baseball player
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 1**: The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player can live in House 2, House 3, or House 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
   - This means the basketball player must be in a house to the left of the swimmer.

4. **Clue 4**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner must be in a house to the left of the fish enthusiast.

5. **Clue 5**: The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
   - This means the bird keeper can live in House 2, House 3, or House 4.

6. **Clue 6**: The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the tennis player and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses.

7. **Clue 7**: The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - This means the bird keeper can live in House 1 or House 4.

Let's use these clues to determine the correct arrangement:

- From Clue 3, the baseball player is in House 2.
- From Clue 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1, so it must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. Since the baseball player is already in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 3 or House 4.
- From Clue 2, the basketball player must be to the left of the swimmer. Therefore, the basketball player cannot be in House 4, so it must be in House 3.
- Now, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: ?
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: Basketball player
  - House 4: ?

- From Clue 4, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4, and the dog owner must be in House 3.
- From Clue 5, the bird keeper cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 1 or House 4. Since the fish enthusiast is in House 4, the bird keeper must be in House 1.
- From Clue 6, the tennis player and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the fish enthusiast is in House 4 and the dog owner is in House 3, the tennis player and the cat lover must be in House 3 and House 4, but since the fish enthusiast is already in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3 and the cat lover must be in House 4.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Basketball player
- House 4: Cat lover

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **White and Computer:**
   - The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - This means the computer owner cannot be in the first house, and the white lover cannot be in the first house either.

2. **Baseball Player and Blue:**
   - There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - This means the baseball player must be in house 2, and the person who likes blue must be in house 3.

3. **Sedan and SUV:**
   - The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the sedan owner and the SUV owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Sedan and Gameboy:**
   - The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - This means the sedan owner and the gameboy owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

5. **Violinist and First House:**
   - The violinist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the violinist must live in either house 2 or 3.

6. **Guitarist and White:**
   - The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the guitarist must live in a house to the right of the white lover.

### Deduction

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

From clue 1, we know:
- The computer owner cannot be in house 1, and the white lover cannot be in house 1.

From clue 3, we know:
- The sedan and SUV owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 4, we know:
- The sedan and gameboy owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 5, we know:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1.

From clue 6, we know:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover.

### Combining Clues

Let's place the known elements:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

Now, let's place the sedan and SUV:
- If the sedan is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (but house 2 is already taken by the baseball player).
- Therefore, the sedan must be in house 2, and the SUV must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

Now, we need to place the violinist and the white lover:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.
- The white lover must be in house 1 or 3.

Since the white lover cannot be in house 1 (because the computer owner is there), the white lover must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 2 for the sedan owner.

Now, we need to place the guitarist and the gameboy:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover (house 3), so the guitarist must be in house 3.
- The gameboy must be next to the sedan owner (house 2).

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

### Final Arrangement

- House 1: Computer owner
- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Person who likes blue

The remaining characteristics:
- The white lover is in house 3.
- The guitar is in house 3.
- The gameboy is in house 2.
- The violinist is in house 2.
- The baseball player is in house 2.
- The soccer player is in house 1.

Thus, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the corresponding characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and is directly left of the person who had fried rice. Therefore, the person who had fried rice must live in the second house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house, and the person who has a phone must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house. This contradicts the previous deduction that the person who has a phone lives in the third house. Therefore, we need to reassess the positions.

Since the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be next to each other, and the person who had pizza is in the second house, the person who has a phone must be in the third house. The cat lover, who lives in the third house, must be the person who has a phone.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

- First house: Person who ate grilled cheese
- Second house: Person who had pizza
- Third house: Person who has a phone (cat lover)
- Fourth house: Person who has a television
- Fifth house: Person who has a gameboy

All clues are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **The tea drinker does not live in the first house.**
2. **The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.**
3. **The person who likes red does not live in the third house.**
4. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.**
5. **The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.**
6. **There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.**
7. **The person who likes milk lives in the third house.**
8. **The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.**
9. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
10. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.**
11. **The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.**
12. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
13. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.**

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. This contradicts Clue 7, so there must be a mistake. Let's re-evaluate the setup.

From Clue 1, the tea drinker does not live in the first house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house.

From Clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who only drinks water is in the second house and the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must be in houses 1 and 5 or 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the fourth house, the root beer lover must be in the first house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth house. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the fourth house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fifth or sixth house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the milk drinker is in the third house and the person who only drinks water is in the second house, the person who likes red must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in the first house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the second house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a truck is in the fifth or sixth house and the person who likes blue is in the first house, the person who drives a truck must be in the sixth house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who is eating mangos is in the second house and the person who likes green is in the fifth house, the person who likes green must be in the sixth house.

   - This means the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 4.

3. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing running shoes lives in house 1, the person wearing boots must live in house 2.

Let's place the people in the houses based on these clues:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: (S, C, H, T)
- House 3: (S, C, H, T)

Since the cricketer is in house 1, the sedan owner (S) and the horse owner (H) must be in houses 2 and 3. Also, the cat lover (C) must be in a house adjacent to the sedan owner (S) or the horse owner (H).

Let's try placing the sedan owner (S) and the horse owner (H) in houses 2 and 3:

- House 2: S (sedan owner)
- House 3: H (horse owner)

This leaves the cat lover (C) and the truck driver (T) to be placed in houses 2 and 3. Since the cat lover (C) must be adjacent to the sedan owner (S), and the horse owner (H) is already in house 3, the cat lover (C) must be in house 2. This leaves the truck driver (T) to be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Cat lover (C)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)

Since the truck driver (T) lives in house 3, the basketball player (B) must live in house 2.

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer

- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
   - The swimmer must live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the basketball player and the truck driver must be in adjacent houses, with the basketball player being to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
   - The minivan driver lives in house 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
    - The root beer lover lives in house 3.

From the above, we know:
- House 4 (Minivan driver): Root beer lover.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): Root beer lover.
- House 2 (Swimmer): The swimmer must be to the left of the sedan owner, and the sedan owner must be to the left of the truck driver. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2.
- House 1 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 1.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver lives in house 4.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- House 2 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 2.
- House 1 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 1.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver lives in house 4.
- House 2 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 2.
- House 1 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 1.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver lives in house 4.

From the above, we can see that the truck driver must be in house 1, as house 1 is the only house left for the truck driver to live in, given the constraints.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house (Clue 1).
2. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person driving a minivan (Clue 2).
3. The person driving a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 3).
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives (Clue 4).
5. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house (Clue 5).

Let's analyze the possible positions:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.
- The person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

Given Clue 4, the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement step by step to determine the house where the person who owns an SUV lives.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

Let's verify if this fits with the other clues:

2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - If the SUV owner is in house 3, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 must be the person who drives a convertible.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. But house 1 is already taken by the person who drives a convertible, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - The person who drives a convertible is in house 1, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - The person who drives a minivan must be in house 2 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible), and the dog owner must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
   - The person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, and house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV). The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 4. Since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The bird keeper is in house 4, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

8. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - The person who drives a minivan is in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, the history book buff must be in house 1.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos), and the romance book lover must be in house 4.

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
    - The person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

Given all these clues, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Person who drives a convertible
- House 2: Person who is eating mangos
- House 3: Person who owns an SUV
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house (house 2). This means:
   - House 2: Person with a rose bouquet.

2. **Clue 1**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker. This means:
   - If the television is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet).
   - If the television is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 3.
   - If the television is in house 3, the tea drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet).

   Therefore, the television must be in house 1 and the tea drinker must be in house 3.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker. This means:
   - The coffee drinker must be in a house with a lower number than the person eating kiwis.

4. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker does not live in the second house. This is already satisfied by the arrangement above.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist. This means:
   - The television is in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means:
   - If the flutist lives in house 1, the person eating a banana must live in house 3.
   - If the flutist lives in house 2, the person eating a banana must live in house 1.
   - If the flutist lives in house 3, the person eating a banana must live in house 2.

   Since the person eating bananas is in house 1 and the person eating kiwis is in house 3, the flutist must live in house 2.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio. This means:
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 3, the person with a radio must be in house 1.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2, the person with a radio must be in house 1.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 1, the person with a radio must be in house 1.

   Since the person with a radio is in house 1, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3.

From the above deductions, we have:
- House 1: Person with a radio, eating bananas, and having a vase of tulips.
- House 2: Person with a rose bouquet, flutist.
- House 3: Person with a television, guitarist, and eating kiwis.

The root beer lover must live in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 1"
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast.

2. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
   - This means the person eating apples and the person wearing boots must be in houses 2 and 4 or 1 and 3.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 2**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in either the fourth house or the fifth house (but since there are only 4 houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house).

7. **Clue 1**: The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the second house.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person eating a banana must live in either the fourth or the fifth house. But since there are only 4 houses, the person eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Second house: History book buff
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic (from Clue 2 and Clue 6)
- First house: Person eating mangos (from Clue 5 and Clue 3)
- Fourth house: Person eating a banana (from Clue 8)
- Fifth house: Person eating apples (from Clue 4 and Clue 3)

Since the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house, and the fourth house is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person eating apples must live in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: History book buff
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct option is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house (number 1). Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house (number 2).
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house (number 2). Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house (number 1).
3. The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the flutist lives in the first house (number 1), the person who likes white must live in the second house (number 2).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house (number 2), the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house (number 1).

From these deductions, we can summarize the characteristics as follows:
- **First House (Number 1)**:
  - Flutist
  - Wearing loafers
  - Owns an SUV
- **Second House (Number 2)**:
  - Person who likes white
  - Wearing sandals
  - Owns an SUV

But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the sedan owner and the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 1, and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From Clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew
- House 4: Blue, loafers, not white
- House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew
- House 6: Not white, not red, not stew

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The correct answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person living in the first house (house 1) has a television. Since the person in the first house has a television, the person in the second house (house 2) must have the computer (since there is only one computer and one television).

From clue 1, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house (house 2).

Now we know:
- The person in the first house (house 1) has a television.
- The person in the second house (house 2) has a computer.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic (SFF) and the golfer (Golfer) must be in different houses, and the golfer must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - Possible positions: Golfer in House 2, SFF in House 1.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza-eater (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) must be in adjacent houses.
   - Possible positions: PE in House 1, HBB in House 2 or PE in House 2, HBB in House 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D.
   - Possible positions: G in House 2, D in House 1 or G in House 1, D in House 2.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1, Golfer is in House 2 and SFF is in House 1.
- From Clue 2, PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since Golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.
- From Clue 3, G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.
2. The basketball player does not live in house 1, so the basketball player must live in house 2.
3. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2.

From these deductions, we can conclude that the violinist lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Let's start by placing the known individuals:

- Tennis player: 3rd house
- Grilled cheese: 5th house
- Golfer: 4th house
- Stew: 1st house (since the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the 1st house is the only position left for stew)
- Spaghetti: 3rd house (since the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the 3rd house is the only position left for spaghetti)

Now, we need to place the remaining individuals (soccer player, cricketer, and pizza eater) in the remaining houses (2nd and 5th houses):

- The 5th house is occupied by grilled cheese.
- The 3rd house is occupied by spaghetti.
- The 1st house is occupied by stew.
- The 4th house is occupied by the golfer.
- The 2nd house must be occupied by the cricketer (since the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer, and the cricketer must be to the left of the soccer player).

Thus, the cricketer lives in the 2nd house.

The correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses as follows:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (house 2).
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

From the above deductions:
- **House 1:** Person who only drinks water, Person who likes white, Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2)
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water (lives in house 1), Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2), Person who likes red (lives in house 2), Person who plays baseball (lives in house 1), Person who wears loafers (lives in house 2)

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(A) 2**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the root beer lover and the other characteristics of the people living in the houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to the houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively. We will use the clues to deduce the positions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

**Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

### Final Deduction

Given the constraints and the need for the romance book lover and the mystery book reader to live next to each other, and considering the other constraints, the only house that fits all the conditions is the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is:

(D) 2"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The dog owner lives in house 3.
2. The root beer lover lives in house 5.
3. The person wearing sandals does not live in house 2.
4. The coffee drinker and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other.
5. The person wearing running shoes and the bird keeper live next to each other.
6. There is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person with a bouquet of lilies.
7. There is one house between the person who owns horses and the person with a bouquet of lilies.
8. The person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the bird keeper.
9. The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
10. The person with a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.
11. There are two houses between the person who only drinks water and the person who is wearing boots.
12. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Let's analyze the positions step by step:

- Since the dog owner is in house 3, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in either house 2 or house 4 (one house away from house 3).
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in either house 1 or house 2 (one house away from house 3).
- The person with a bouquet of lilies cannot be in house 2 because the person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the bird keeper, and the bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2. If the person with a bouquet of lilies were in house 2, the person with a carnations arrangement would be in house 1, which is not possible since the person with a carnations arrangement must be in house 1 (as the person with a bouquet of lilies is one house away from house 3 and the person with a carnations arrangement is directly left of the bird keeper).

Thus, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 4.

The person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 (since the person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the bird keeper, and the bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2).

The person with a vase of tulips must be in house 1 (since the person with a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner, and the dog owner is in house 3).

The person with a carnations arrangement must be in house 1 (since the person with a vase of tulips is in house 1 and the person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the bird keeper, and the bird keeper must be in house 1).

The person with a rose bouquet must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other, and the person with a rose bouquet cannot be in house 2 because the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 2).

The person with a root beer lover must be in house 5.

The person with a shoe (sandals) must be in house 1 (since the person with a shoe cannot be in house 2).

The person with a bird keeper must be in house 1 (since the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers, and the person with a shoe is in house 1).

The person with a running shoe must be in house 2 (since the person with a running shoe and the bird keeper live next to each other, and the person with a shoe is in house 1).

The person with a loafers must be in house 1 (since the bird keeper is in house 1 and the person with a loafers must be directly right of the bird keeper).

The person with a cat lover must be in house 4 (since the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 2).

The person with a horse must be in house 4 (since the person with a horse lives one house away from the person with a bouquet of lilies, and the person with a bouquet of lilies is in house 4).

The person with a root beer lover must be in house 5 (as given).

The person with a water drinker must be in house 4 (since the person with a water drinker lives two houses away from the person with a shoe, and the person with a shoe is in house 1).

The person with a tea drinker must be in house 3 (since the person with a tea drinker is the only one left).

The person with a milk drinker must be in house 2 (since the person with a milk drinker lives directly next to the person with a water drinker, and the person with a water drinker is in house 4).

Thus, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."

"Given the clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

We can deduce the following:
- Since the baseball player lives in the second house (Clue 2), and the person driving a convertible also lives in the second house (Clue 3), the person eating grapes must live in the second house.
- Consequently, the person eating grapes lives in the second house, and the person driving a convertible also lives in the second house.
- Therefore, the person eating mangos must live in the first house (Clue 1).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people and their characteristics as follows:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house (house 2).
   - This means the person who likes blue is in house 2.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 3. But since the person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person who is eating apples is in house 1 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3. But we already know the person who likes blue is in house 2, so the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since the person who likes blue is in house 2 and the person who likes white must be in house 3).
   - Therefore, the person who likes white must be in house 3.

Based on the above deductions, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 3 (but there is no house 3, so this is not possible).

2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses, with the soccer player in house 1 and the mystery book reader in house 2, or vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the person with the gameboy must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person with the gameboy is in house 1.
- The mystery book reader is in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player is in house 1 (since the mystery book reader is in house 2).

From Clue 1, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 (since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, Gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Root beer, Rose bouquet

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the people as Cat Lover, Fish Enthusiast, Horse Owner, and Dog Owner.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**From Clue 4:**
- The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
- This means the fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 2:**
- There are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
- This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in the first or last house. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

**From Clue 3:**
- The truck lives directly left of the sedan.
- This means the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 1:**
- The minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- This means the minivan cannot be in the first house.

**From Clue 5:**
- The cat lover does not live in the second house.
- This means the cat lover must live in either the first or the fourth house.

### Combining Clues:

Let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

1. **Dog owner in house 3:**
   - Truck must be in house 2 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 4 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 3).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration works:
   - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
   - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
   - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
   - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

2. **Dog owner in house 4:**
   - Truck must be in house 3 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 2 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 3 and the dog owner is in house 4).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

2. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step.

### Clue Breakdown

1. **Cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.**

5. **Person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
6. **Person who likes blue lives in the second house.**
7. **Person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.**

### Initial Setup

- **House 2:** Person who likes blue (Clue 6).

### Deduction

- **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
  - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1, and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in house 3.

- **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
  - This means the baseball player cannot be in house 3, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

- **Clue 3:** The person eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
  - This means the basketball player cannot be in house 3, and the person eating grapes cannot be in house 1.

- **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
  - This means the dog owner cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes green cannot be in house 1.

- **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
  - This means the dog owner cannot be in house 3, and the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 1.

- **Clue 7:** The person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.
  - This means the person eating grapes cannot be in house 3, and the person wearing loafers cannot be in house 1.

### Arrangement

Given the constraints, let's place the people step by step:

1. **House 1:** Dog owner (Clue 4 and Clue 5).
2. **House 2:** Person who likes blue (Clue 6).
3. **House 3:** Cricketer (Clue 1), Person wearing sandals (Clue 5), Person eating grapes (Clue 3), Person wearing loafers (Clue 7).

Now, we need to place the baseball player and the cat lover:

- **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
  - The baseball player cannot be in house 3, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.
  - Therefore, the baseball player must be in house 1, and the cat lover must be in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- **House 1:** Dog owner, Baseball player
- **House 2:** Person who likes blue
- **House 3:** Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes, Person wearing loafers

### Conclusion

The person who likes white (the only color left) must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (as house 1 is taken by the dog owner and baseball player), the bird keeper must be in house 3.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is **(B) 3**."

- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Blue

The person who is eating mangos lives in House 2, and the person who likes green lives in House 5. The romance book lover lives in House 1, and the mystery book reader lives in House 4. The history book buff must live in House 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the history book buff lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

We can deduce the arrangement as follows:

- Since the dog owner cannot be in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2.
- The cellist and the person with the gameboy are neighbors, and the cellist is to the left of the person with the gameboy. This means the cellist must be in house 1 and the person with the gameboy must be in house 2.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is (B) 2."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person who owns an SUV lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person with a phone and the person with an SUV must be adjacent, and the phone must be to the left of the SUV.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

Given the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, we can place the phone and SUV as follows:
- The person with a phone must be in house 2 (since house 1 is occupied by the minivan and house 3 is occupied by the gameboy).
- The person with an SUV must be in house 4 (since house 4 is occupied by the radio and the phone must be to the left of the SUV).

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct placement of each person and their respective items. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the houses step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Computer

2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tulips

3. **Clue 7**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement must be in adjacent houses. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Since the computer is in house 2, the adjacent houses for the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement are houses 1 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since house 3 already has tulips, the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 3. But since house 2 already has a computer, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 4.

   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 4: Carnations arrangement

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the daffodils and radio must be in houses 4 and 5, or 3 and 4, or 2 and 3, or 1 and 2, or 1 and 3. Since house 1 already has a rose bouquet and house 3 has tulips, the only possible pair is houses 2 and 5.

   - House 2: Computer
   - House 5: Daffodils

5. **Clue 1**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the lilies and phone must be in houses 3 and 4, 4 and 5, or 2 and 3, or 1 and 2, or 1 and 3. Since house 3 already has tulips and house 4 has daffodils, the only possible pair is houses 2 and 3.

   - House 2: Computer
   - House 3: Tulips
   - House 4: Daffodils
   - House 5: Lilies

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television.
   - This means the phone and television must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. Since house 2 already has a computer, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 3.

   - House 1: Phone
   - House 3: Tulips
   - House 2: Computer
   - House 4: Daffodils
   - House 5: Lilies

7. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is already satisfied as house 4 has daffodils.

### Conclusion:
The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives in the second house. This contradicts Clue 1, so the fish enthusiast must be someone else. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in the second house.
4. **Clue 6:** The bird keeper lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other. This means the cricketer and the person with loafers must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

8. **Clue 10:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
9. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.

3. **Radio and Truck**: The person with the radio and the person driving the truck live next to each other (clue 1).
4. **Radio and Pizza**: The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza (clue 2).

From clue 4, the person with the radio must be in house 1 (since they must be next to the person with the pizza and the pizza person must be in house 1).

From clue 2, the person with the radio (in house 1) must be to the left of the person who had pizza (in house 1). This means the person who had pizza must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the milk drinker and the spaghetti eater cannot be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the yellow liker cannot be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the white liker and the water drinker must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 5, we know the tea drinker (House 1) and the pizza eater (House 2) are adjacent. Given Clue 7, the green liker cannot be in House 1, and Clue 8, the grilled cheese eater cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the green liker must be in House 3, and the grilled cheese eater must be in House 4.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza eater (adjacent to the tea drinker)
- House 3: Green liker (cannot be in House 1)
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater (adjacent to the pizza eater)

The only house left for the spaghetti eater and the water drinker is House 3. Since the spaghetti eater must be to the left of the water drinker (Clue 6), the spaghetti eater must be in House 3, and the water drinker must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the golfer and the basketball player are adjacent, and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are adjacent, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

3. **Clue 3:** The soccer player lives in the third house.
   - This means the soccer player lives in house number 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in a house number less than the house number where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person with tulips does not live in house number 3.

From Clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in house number 3. Now, let's consider Clue 1 and Clue 2 together. Since the golfer and the basketball player are adjacent and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player, they must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 2, the person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are adjacent, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person with lilies must be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in a house number greater than the house number where the person who ate grilled cheese lives (Clue 4), house 4 is the correct placement for the person who ate spaghetti.

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct house number where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. **Clue 2:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This directly answers the question.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the root beer lover lives in a house with a higher number than the person who is wearing sandals.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, 2, or 4, the only option left is house 1. So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 1.

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 4), the only option left for the person who only drinks water is house 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 2 for the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), the person who had stew must be in house 1, which is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater.

So, the only remaining option for the person who had stew is house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 4 for the person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 5). The person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew (Clue 5), and the only option left is house 4.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 4.

The correct option is (A) 4."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the person with the computer lives.

3. **Clue 12**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
6. **Clue 6**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
8. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
9. **Clue 7**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

11. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
12. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From Clue 11, we know the cricketer lives in the third house. From Clue 12, the person who is wearing loafers also lives in the third house. From Clue 5, the person who has a radio lives in the third house. From Clue 6, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From Clue 10, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. From Clue 1, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. From Clue 3, the root beer lover does not live in the first house. From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. From Clue 2, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Sixth house: person who had stew (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the sixth house)
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who had stew
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above analysis, the person with the computer lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).

From Clue 1, we know that the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2, and the person who ate pizza must be in house 1. Since the person who ate pizza is the one who likes science fiction books, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is (B) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- The pianist lives in house 1.
- The root beer lover lives in house 2.
- The person who owns horses lives in house 1 (since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who owns horses, and the root beer lover is in house 2).

This leaves the person who likes white to live in house 1. Therefore, the dog owner, who is the person who owns horses, lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

2. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the violinist cannot be in house 1.

4. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 3.

5. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 1, and the percussionist cannot be in house 4.

6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 4.

7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

From the above, we know:
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

The only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{C}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses as follows:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Likes white

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not wearing boots

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not a bird keeper

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils

5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Likes green (since it's directly left of the person wearing running shoes)

6. **Clue 6:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - House 3: Owns horses
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 1: Likes white

7. **Clue 7:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

From Clue 7, we know that the person who owns horses lives in House 3 and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in House 2.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who owns horses (House 3) and the person who has daffodils (House 2) are next to each other, the person who likes green must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3. However, since the person who owns horses is already in House 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Likes white, Wearing sandals
- House 2: Has daffodils, Wearing running shoes
- House 3: Owns horses, Wearing boots

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement of the houses with the person eating apples in the third house is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses as follows:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in house number 1.
2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house number 2.
3. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies

Since the person who only drinks water is in house 1, the person who likes milk must be in house 3 (one house to the right of house 1). This leaves house 2 for the person who has a vase of tulips.

Now, we need to place the person who has a rose bouquet. From Clue 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (in house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. But house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3, leaving house 2 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a rose bouquet
- House 3: Person who likes milk

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's reanalyze the clues with a focus on logical deduction:

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**

From clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1. From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, so the person who is wearing sandals must live in house 4. This means the cricketer lives in house 3.

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in house 3. Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 4 (clue 3).

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in house 2. Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 3 and the person who has a gameboy lives in house 4, the person who has a phone must live in house 1. This contradicts clue 9, which states the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement.

Since the person who likes green must live in house 1 (clue 9), and the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1, the person who likes green must be the person who is wearing loafers. This means the person who likes green lives in house 1.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who likes green lives in house 1, the person who has a phone must live in house 2 (since house 1 is occupied by the person who likes green). This means the person who has a radio lives in house 3.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in house 2, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 3. This contradicts the fact that the person who likes yellow lives in house 3. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement again.

Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 4. This means the person who has a phone must live in house 2, and the person who has a radio must live in house 1.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 4, the cricketer must live in house 3.

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (house number 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and the romance book lover must be to the left of the history book buff. Given that the yellow person is in house 1, the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 3.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so the pizza eater must be in either house 2 or house 3. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the pizza eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who ate fried rice must live somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the fried rice eater must be in house 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step.

### Clue 1: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
This means the tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be in a house to the left of the television.

### Clue 2: The golfer does not live in the second house.
This means the golfer cannot be in house number 2.

### Clue 3: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
This means the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses.

### Clue 4: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
This means the radio and rose bouquet must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the rose bouquet.

### Clue 5: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.
This means the radio and television must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on Clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

### Case 1: Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Television (V) in house 2

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

### Checking the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who is wearing sandals.

### Clues Recap:
1. The swimmer lives in the third house.

### Deductions:
- **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives in the third house.
  - House 3: Swimmer

- **Clue 2:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
  - This means the guitarist cannot live in house 5, and the carnations arrangement cannot live in house 1.

- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
  - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the tulips person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
  - This means if the running shoes person is in house X, the daffodils person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 5:** The violinist lives in the second house.
  - House 2: Violinist

- **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
  - This means if the basketball player is in house X, the guitarist is in house X+1.

- **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
  - This means if the high heels person is in house X, the lilies person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
  - This means if the loafers person is in house X, the percussionist is in house X+1.

- **Clue 9:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
  - House 4: Cricketer

- **Clue 10:** The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
  - This means they must be in houses X and X+1.

- **Clue 11:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
  - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

- **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
  - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the cellist must be in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

### Deduction Process:
1. **House 1:** Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
2. **House 2:** Violinist.
3. **House 3:** Swimmer.
4. **House 4:** Cricketer.
5. **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils.

Given Clue 11, the daffodils person is in house 5. Clue 12 tells us that the sandals person must be in house 1 or 3. Since the sandals person must be directly left of the tulips person, and house 3 is occupied by the swimmer, the sandals person must be in house 1.

### Final Check:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

The person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The fish enthusiast lives in house 1.
- The person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

Since the person in house 2 (house 2) ate grilled cheese, the person in house 1 (house 1) must be the fish enthusiast.

Since the fish enthusiast (in house 1) cannot be the dog owner (as the dog owner must be in house 2), the dog owner must be in house 2.

This leaves the person in house 1 as the dog owner and the person in house 2 as the fish enthusiast (who ate grilled cheese and is wearing high heels).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's reorganize the information and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. **Clue 13:** The person who owns horses lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Person who owns horses

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Romance book lover

3. **Clue 7:** The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fish enthusiast

4. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who has a vase of tulips lives and where the romance book lover lives.
   - Romance book lover is in house 5, so the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 4 or 6.
   - Since the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 4 (not house 6 because that would leave no house for the person who likes red).

   - House 4: Person who has a vase of tulips

5. **Clue 10:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - The bird keeper must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is taken by the person who owns horses.
   - Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 1.
   - House 1: Bird keeper

6. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - The person who likes yellow must be in house 1 (since the bird keeper is in house 1 and the bouquet of lilies must be to the left of the bird keeper).
   - House 1: Person who likes yellow

7. **Clue 9:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in house 1, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.
   - House 2: Person who has a bouquet of daffodils

8. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - The fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1 (since the person who likes yellow is in house 1).
   - The person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 5 (since the romance book lover is in house 5).
   - House 5: Person who has a rose bouquet

9. **Clue 11:** The person who likes red and the romance book lover live directly next to each other.
   - The romance book lover is in house 5, so the person who likes red must be in house 4.
   - House 4: Person who likes red

10. **Clue 12:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
    - The person who likes blue must be in house 2 (since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 2).
    - The mystery book reader must be in house 1 (since the person who likes yellow is in house 1).
    - House 1: Mystery book reader

11. **Clue 6:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - The fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1, so the dog owner must be in house 2.
    - House 2: Dog owner

12. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
    - The person who likes blue is in house 2, so the history book buff must be in house 1.
    - House 1: History book buff

From the above deductions, we can conclude:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Person who likes red
- House 5: Romance book lover
- House 6: Person who likes yellow

Therefore, the number of the house where the cat lover lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house where the person eating oranges lives step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 4:** The flutist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
4. **Clue 7:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
5. **Clue 11:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
6. **Clue 12:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
7. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 14:** The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 15:** The science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2 and Clue 4, we know the third house is occupied by the flutist and the person with a phone. Since the flutist lives in the third house, the person with a phone must be in the third house as well. This means the person with a phone and the flutist are the same person.

From Clue 7, the romance book lover and the science fiction book fanatic are in houses 1 and 2. Since the person with a phone (flutist) is in the third house, the romance book lover and the science fiction book fanatic must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 11, the person wearing high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast are two houses apart. Since the person wearing high heels cannot be in the first house (Clue 13), the only possible positions for the person wearing high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast are houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 5 (but since we only have 4 houses, it must be 1 and 4).

From Clue 12, the history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges. This means the history book buff must be in house 1, and the person eating oranges must be in house 2 or 3 or 4.

From Clue 14, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic and the person wearing running shoes live directly next to each other. Since the person with a phone (flutist) is in the third house, the person wearing running shoes must be in the second house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (SF)
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes (RS)
- House 3: Flutist (F)
- House 4: Percussionist (P)

Since the person eating oranges must be to the right of the person wearing boots and to the left of the person eating kiwis, and the person eating kiwis cannot be in the first house (Clue 13), the only possible position for the person eating oranges is house 4.

Therefore, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house. This means the person who had stew can live in houses 1, 2, or 4.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who only drinks water must live in the next house to the right of the person who had stew.
3. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the person who likes white must live in a house to the right of the person who had stew.
4. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza. This means the person who is eating apples must live in a house to the right of the person who had pizza.

From Clue 9 and Clue 10, the person who had stew must live in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must live in house 2. The person who likes white must live in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza must live in house 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in house 3.

From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 1, and the person who is eating apples must live in house 4.

Thus, the person who is eating apples lives in house 4.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know:
- The fourth house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
- The fourth house is also occupied by the saxophonist.

Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other, the violinist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house and the percussionist is in the third house, the history book buff must be in the second house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the percussionist is in the third house and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, this clue is consistent.

From Clue 1, the romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the violinist lives in the third house.

The number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{C}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the characteristics of the people living in each house step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Television

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers (already determined)
   - House 3: Phone (since the phone cannot be in house 2)

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - House 1: Boots
   - House 2: Loafers

5. **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - House 1: Boots
   - House 2: Loafers
   - House 3: Phone
   - House 4: Television

Given the remaining houses (1, 2, 3, and 4) and the characteristics:
- Radio
- Gameboy
- Phone
- Sandals

We need to place the remaining characteristics in the remaining houses (houses 1, 2, 3, and 4).

From Clue 5, we know:
- The radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4.
- Since house 2 is already occupied by loafers, the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3.

Let's consider the possible placements:
- If the radio is in house 1, then the sandals must be in house 3.
- If the radio is in house 3, then the sandals must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Radio in house 1, Sandals in house 3**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 1: Radio
- House 3: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which contradicts Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

**Scenario 2: Radio in house 3, Sandals in house 1**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 3: Radio
- House 1: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which is consistent with Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

The person who has a gameboy lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or the third house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house, so they must live in either the second or the third house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house, so they must live in the third house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the coffee drinker lives in the third house. From Clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. Therefore, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes must be the same person, which is a contradiction since they have different characteristics (drinking habits and footwear). This implies there might be a misinterpretation or a need to re-evaluate the clues.

However, if we strictly follow the clues and assume no contradictions, we can deduce:

- The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
- The coffee drinker lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk must live in the first house.

Thus, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person wearing loafers cannot live in the first house (Clue 1), they must live in the second house.
- The mystery book reader cannot live in the second house (Clue 2), so they must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (P) lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives directly left of the person who had stew (St).
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a television (Tv) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots (B) lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (P).
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) based on Clue 2 and Clue 9:

- Clue 2: The person who had pizza (P) lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
- Clue 9: The person who is wearing boots (B) must be to the left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who had pizza and the person who is wearing sandals.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) must be adjacent.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots (B) must be to the left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's try different placements:

- If P is in house 1, then S must be in house 2 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 2, then B must be in house 1 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P. So, let's try another arrangement:

- If P is in house 2, then S must be in house 3 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 3, then B must be in house 2 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is also not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P.

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is possible. Let's check the other clues with this arrangement:

- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's place the remaining items:

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4.
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (Clue 9).
- If R is in house 2, then G must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If T is in house 1, then C must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If R is in house 2, then St must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- If Rb is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If Sp is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 10).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house.

- House 2: The saxophonist (saxophonist)
- The rose bouquet is in house 1 or house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1 or house 2.

From Clue 1, we know the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2. This matches our deductions from Clue 3 and Clue 2.

Therefore, the person eating apples must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is (B) 2."

"Given the clues, let's reanalyze the information to determine the house where the person who drives a truck lives.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

### Analysis:
- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.
- From Clue 2, the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
- From Clue 3, the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

Let's consider the possible placements:

1. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

2. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

3. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

4. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

5. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

### Conclusion:
The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the information provided, let's deduce the correct house number where the person who likes milk lives.

From the clues:
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic (since the violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic and the possible pair is (3, 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3 and the violinist in house 4)
- House 4: Violinist (since the violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water, and the violinist is in house 4, the person who only drinks water must be in house 5)
- House 5: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Not science fiction book fanatic (from clue 11)
- House 1: Person who has a bouquet of daffodils (from clue 29)
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Person who only drinks water

Since the person who likes milk lives directly next to the person who has a rose bouquet (clue 12), and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 3 (since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 3), the person who likes milk must be in house 2.

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the constraints and the information provided, let's deduce the correct house for the basketball player step by step:

1. **First house**: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
2. **Fourth house**: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Third house**: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
4. **Second house**: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Green and Yellow**: The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who likes green.
   - Therefore, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

2. **Stew and Grilled Cheese**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

3. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

4. **Grilled Cheese**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

5. **Romance Book Lover**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the romance book lover lives in the second house, which is consistent with the previous information.

### Summary of Arrangement

- **First House**: Person who ate grilled cheese
- **Second House**: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- **Third House**: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

### Determining the Person Who Likes Blue

- The person who likes green lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

### Final Answer

The number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is **1**.

The correct option is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the bird keeper lives step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- First house: Carnations (person with carnations)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Second house: Vase of tulips and bird keeper
- Fourth house: Rose bouquet and person who likes blue (next to the person who owns horses)
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Second house: Percussionist or cellist
- Third house: Truck (next to the percussionist or cellist)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to reassess the clues.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist cannot both live in the first house, let's consider the possibility that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1) and the cellist lives in the second house (number 2).

Now, using clue 3: the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the first house (number 1) is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the person who likes green must live in the second house (number 2), and the person who likes red must live in the first house (number 1).

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues:

1. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. The history book buff lives in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

From Clue 3, the history book buff lives in the first house. So, the arrangement is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, let's use Clue 1: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Now, the swimmer must live in the first or third house. But since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the swimmer must live in the first house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Thus, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, we know that the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2 because the sedan owner lives to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies, and house 1 is to the left of house 2.

From Clue 2, the flutist does not live in house 1, so the flutist must live in house 2.

Since the flutist lives in house 2, the person with the bouquet of lilies must also live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

- House 1: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means if the minivan driver is in house 2, the person wearing boots must be in house 1.
   - If the minivan driver is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

2. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the person with pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the person with pizza must be in house 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, the person with pizza must be in house 3 (but this is not possible since the person with pizza must be to the right).

3. **The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person wearing running shoes must live in either house 2 or 3.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means if the person with tulips is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 1.
   - If the person with tulips is in house 3, the cricketer must be in house 2.

5. **The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with pizza must live in either house 1 or 3.

6. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means if the person with grilled cheese is in house 2, the person with sedan must be in house 1.
   - If the person with grilled cheese is in house 3, the person with sedan must be in house 2.

7. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person driving a minivan is in house 3.

8. **The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1.

9. **The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must live in either house 1 or 3.

From clue 7, the person driving a minivan is in house 3. From clue 8, the golfer is in house 1. From clue 5, the person who had pizza cannot be in house 2, so the person who had pizza must be in house 1 or 3. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From clue 4, the cricketer must be in house 1 (since the person with tulips cannot be in house 1). From clue 3, the person wearing running shoes cannot be in house 1, so the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since the person with sedan must be in house 1).

From clue 2, the person with pizza (in house 3) must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since the person with pizza is in house 3, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's refine the placement of the percussionist based on the clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate fried rice lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
7. **Clue 8:** The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
8. **Clue 9:** The flutist lives in the second house.
9. **Clue 10:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives.
12. **Clue 13:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
13. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
14. **Clue 15:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Given the saxophonist is in the third house (Clue 4), and the coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist (Clue 10), we can place the coffee drinker and percussionist as follows:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 1: Cellist
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 5: Person who likes yellow

Since the person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist (Clue 8), the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 or House 2. Given the cellist is in House 1, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2.

- House 1: Cellist

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 5: Person who likes milk

The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other (Clue 5). The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice (Clue 6).

"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means if the person who had stew lives in house \(x\), the person who likes red lives in house \(x-1\).

4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 2.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 4.

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in house 2.

7. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes blue lives in house \(x\), the person who ate spaghetti must live in house \(x+1\).

8. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house \(x\), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house \(x+1\) or \(x+2\).

Let's start by placing the person who had stew:
- Since the person who had stew cannot be in house 2 or 4, and they must be directly left of the person who likes red, the only possible positions for the person who had stew are houses 1 or 5.

If the person who had stew is in house 1:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: Green (since green cannot be in house 2)
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Yellow (since yellow must be in house 4 or 2, and 2 is already taken by green)
- House 5: Red (since red must be in house 5 or 4, and 4 is taken by yellow)

This configuration works:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: Green
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From this, we can deduce:
- The person who likes white must be in house 2 (since green is in house 2 and white must be to the left of spaghetti).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (since white is in house 2 and spaghetti must be to the right of white).

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The percussionist lives in house 2.
2. The person who likes red lives in house 3.
3. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in house 2.
5. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.

Let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Not occupied (since the percussionist is in house 2)
- House 2: Occupied by the percussionist
- House 3: Occupied by the person who likes red
- House 4: Not occupied (since the person who likes red is in house 3)

We need to place the remaining people (the violinist, the tennis player, and the basketball player) in houses 1, 2, and 4.

From Clue 1, the violinist must be in a house to the right of the basketball player. This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 3, the basketball player must be to the right of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 4, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2.

Let's place the violinist and the basketball player:
- Since the violinist must be to the right of the basketball player, and the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 4.
- This leaves house 1 for the tennis player and house 3 for the person who likes red.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: Person who likes red
- House 4: Violinist

Therefore, the basketball player must be in house 1.

The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1."

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following placements:

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.

16. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
17. There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the dog owner in the second house based on Clue 3.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Next, we place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who drives a truck based on Clue 4 and Clue 12.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck, and there are two houses between the truck and the convertible, we can place the truck and the convertible.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Let's place the truck in House 4 and the convertible in House 6 (since there are two houses between the truck and the convertible, and the convertible must be in the fifth house).

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

Now, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 4.

### House 1: Bouquet of daffodils
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

Next, we place the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a radio based on Clue 2.

### House 1: Bouquet of daffodils
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The gameboy must be to the left of the radio, so the gameboy is in House 1 and the radio is in House 2.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

Next, we place the person who has a bouquet of lilies based on Clue 5.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The bouquet of lilies cannot be in House 5, so it must be in House 3.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

Next, we place the person who has a vase of tulips based on Clue 10.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The vase of tulips must be to the left of the person who owns horses, and the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. The convertible is in House 5, so the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

Now, we place the person who has a computer based on Clue 8.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a computer must be in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 1.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

Finally, we place the person who has a television and the person who owns an SUV based on Clue 17.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a television must be in House 3, and the person who owns an SUV must be in House 5.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Television
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: SUV

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house (house 1).
   - House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)

2. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (house 1).
   - This is consistent with Clue 5.

3. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the tea drinker and the cricketer are adjacent.

4. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who only drinks water and the fish enthusiast are not adjacent.

5. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the pizza eater and the dog owner are adjacent.

6. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are not adjacent.

Let's consider the possible positions for the fish enthusiast and the cat lover based on Clue 1:

### Possible positions for the fish enthusiast and the cat lover:
- If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the cat lover must be in house 3.
- If the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the cat lover must be in house 2.

### Case 1: Fish enthusiast in house 2, Cat lover in house 3
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Cat lover

Now, let's place the remaining people based on the other clues:
- The tea drinker must be in house 2 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The cricketer must be in house 3 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The person who only drinks water must be in house 1 (since the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast).
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).
- The dog owner must be in house 3 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).

This configuration does not work because the cat lover and the fish enthusiast cannot be in adjacent houses.

### Case 2: Fish enthusiast in house 3, Cat lover in house 2
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

Now, let's place the remaining people based on the other clues:
- The tea drinker must be in house 2 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The cricketer must be in house 3 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The person who only drinks water must be in house 1 (since the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast).
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).
- The dog owner must be in house 3 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).

This configuration works:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Cat lover (tea drinker, pizza eater)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (cricketer, dog owner)

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person with the bouquet of lilies step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The history book buff lives in the first house (house 1).
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 has a history book and the person in house 2 has a romance book.

2. **Clue 3**: The cat lover does not live in the second house (house 2).
   - This means the cat lover must live in house 1.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the history book buff lives in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 2 (since house 1 is already taken by the history book buff).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with loafers is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1. This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (romance book lover) and person with loafers (loafers)
- House 2: Cat lover (cat enthusiast) and person with computer (computer)

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2, and the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the remaining house, which is house 1.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
4. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. **Clue 1**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
11. **Clue 13**: The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Let's start by placing the history book buff in the second house:
1. Second house: History book buff

Next, we need to place the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice. According to Clue 10, the person who had pizza must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Also, according to Clue 14, there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house:
1. First house: Pizza
2. Second house: History book buff
3. Fourth house: Spaghetti

Now, the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house:
1. First house: Pizza
2. Second house: History book buff
3. Third house: Fried rice
4. Fourth house: Spaghetti

Next, we need to place the person who likes blue and the percussionist. According to Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. According to Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the first house, and the percussionist must be in the second house:
1. First house: Pizza
2. Second house: Blue
3. Third house: Fried rice
4. Fourth house: Spaghetti

Now, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the fourth house:
1. First house: Pizza
2. Second house: Blue
3. Third house: Yellow
4. Fourth house: White

Finally, we need to place the guitarist and the person who has a vase of tulips. According to Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. The only remaining positions are the first and fourth houses, but the first house is occupied by the pizza, so the guitarist must be in the fourth house, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the first house:
1. First house: Guitarist
2. Second house: Blue
3. Third house: Yellow
4. Fourth house: White

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues. Therefore, the person who lives in the first house is the guitarist.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **(B) 3**."

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. 

From clue 1, we know that the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in house 1. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 2).
2. The person who has a television lives in the third house (Clue 10 and Clue 1).
3. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (Clue 2 and Clue 10).
4. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house (Clue 11).
5. The person who had pizza does not live in the third house (Clue 6).
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house (Clue 7).
7. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner (Clue 3).
8. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper (Clue 4).
9. The person who likes green does not live in the second house (Clue 2).
10. The person who has a radio lives in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 11).

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. This leaves the second and fourth houses for the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who has a computer does not live in the second house (Clue 11), the person who has a computer must live in the fourth house. This leaves the second house for the person who had pizza.

The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner (Clue 3), and the person who has a computer lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house, and the dog owner must be in the first house.

The person who likes green does not live in the second house (Clue 2), so the person who likes green must live in the fourth house. This leaves the first house for the person who has a radio.

Thus, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the root beer lover cannot be in the second house (house 2), the root beer lover must be in the first house (house 1).
- The pianist and the cellist must be in the remaining houses, and they must be in adjacent houses with the pianist to the left of the cellist.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
   - Fifth house: Person with carnations.

2. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - Fourth house: Not tulips.

3. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - Adjacent houses for daffodils and running shoes.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - Houses separated by one house.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Tulips to the right of daffodils.

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Adjacent houses for tulips and loafers.

7. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
   - Adjacent houses for boots and carnations.

8. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - Fifth house: Person with carnations.

9. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - Houses adjacent for daffodils and running shoes.

10. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
    - Houses separated by one house.

11. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
    - Tulips to the right of daffodils.

12. **Clue 2**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - Adjacent houses for tulips and loafers.

13. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
    - Adjacent houses for boots and carnations.

14. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
    - Fifth house: Person with carnations.

Let's place the people based on the clues:
- Fifth house: Person with carnations.
- Fourth house: Not tulips.
- Third house: Not daffodils (since daffodils and running shoes are adjacent).
- Second house: Not tulips (since tulips are to the right of daffodils).
- First house: Not sandals (since sandals are not in the fifth house).

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- The person with sandals must be in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house (since the fifth house is occupied by carnations and the fourth house is not occupied by sandals).
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with tulips is in the third house (since it is to the right of the person with daffodils and adjacent to the person with loafers).
- The person with daffodils is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with running shoes and the person with tulips is in the third house).
- The person with running shoes is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with daffodils and one house away from the person with lilies).
- The person with lilies is in the fourth house (since it is one house away from the person with running shoes).

Thus, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the pianist step by step:

1. **Baseball player in house 2.**
2. **Swimmer and white next to each other.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).
3. **One house between blue and oranges.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).
4. **One house between white and tea drinker.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).
5. **Blue to the left of tea drinker.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

From clue 2, the swimmer and white person must be in adjacent houses. Since the baseball player is in house 2, the only possible pair for the swimmer and white is (1, 2).

From clue 3, the blue person and the oranges person must be in adjacent houses. Given the pair (1, 2) for the swimmer and white, the only possible pair for blue and oranges is (2, 3).

From clue 4, the white person and the tea drinker must be in adjacent houses. Since the white person is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 3.

From clue 5, the blue person and the tea drinker must be in adjacent houses. Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the blue person must be in house 2, which contradicts the previous pair (2, 3). Therefore, the only possible pair for blue and oranges is (1, 3).

From clue 6, the percussionist and the green person must be in adjacent houses. Given the pair (1, 3) for blue and oranges, the only possible pair for percussionist and green is (1, 2) or (2, 3). Since the blue person is in house 1, the percussionist and green must be in house 2 and 3, respectively.

From clue 7, the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player. Given the pair (1, 3) for blue and oranges, the only possible pair for saxophonist and tennis player is (1, 2) or (2, 3). Since the blue person is in house 1, the saxophonist and tennis player must be in house 2 and 3, respectively.

From clue 8, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the blue person is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 3, this clue is satisfied.

From clue 9, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the white person is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 3, this clue is satisfied.

From clue 10, the swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the swimmer is in house 1 and the white person is in house 2, this clue is satisfied.

From clue 11, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. Given the pair (1, 3) for blue and oranges, the only possible pair for coffee drinker and pianist is (3, 4).

From clue 12, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the blue person is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 3, this clue is satisfied.

Thus, the pianist must be in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who ate fried rice:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. From Clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW).
2. The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in the first house (house 1).

From Clue 2, we know:
- The SF lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.

This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses. Since the CD is in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1. This leaves the romance book lover to be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the analysis:

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
2. The percussionist is in House 1, and the person with the radio is in House 2.
3. The pianist must be in House 2 (since the percussionist is in House 1 and they play different instruments).
4. The person with the phone must be in House 1 (since the person with the radio is in House 2 and they have different devices).

Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

Let's analyze these clues step by step:

- Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house, we can denote this as House 2.
- The person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with the person who likes white in House 1 and the person who owns a sedan in House 3 (or vice versa, but the order doesn't matter for the final answer).
- The person who likes yellow must be in the house directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan. Given the arrangement of houses 1, 2, and 3, the only way this can be true is if the person who likes yellow is in House 2 and the person who owns a sedan is in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Running shoes (loafers)

2. **Clue 2**: The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

   - Bird keeper (House 4)
   - Two houses between House 1 and House 4: Houses 2 and 3

6. **Clue 6**: The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Bird keeper (loafers)

"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the individuals step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2 (the right house), so the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (the left house).

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person eating grapes must also be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person eating grapes is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker cannot be in house 2).

From the above deductions:
- The person in house 1 is the tea drinker, eating grapes, and wearing sandals.
- The person in house 2 must be the high heels wearer, the water drinker, and the person with the phone (since the person in house 1 has the television).

Therefore, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating kiwis lives is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house (house 1).
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

2. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 3, and the person who only drinks water cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - This means the violinist can only be in houses 2 or 3.

Let's analyze the possible positions for the cellist and the guitarist:

- If the cellist is in house 2, then the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist, and the violinist cannot be in house 3).
- If the cellist is in house 3, then the guitarist must be in house 2, but this would violate Clue 2 (the violinist cannot be in house 3).

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- Cellist in house 2.
- Guitarist in house 3.

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the first house is occupied by someone other than the person wearing running shoes.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person who only drinks water cannot be in the fifth house (where the tea drinker lives), and the person who is wearing boots cannot be in the first house.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by someone who likes milk.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 5, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 5.

Since the third house is occupied by someone who likes milk and the third house is also occupied by someone wearing sandals, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the fifth house, and the coffee drinker must be in the second house.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Person who is wearing loafers
- Third house: Person who likes milk (and wearing sandals)
- Fourth house: Person who only drinks water
- Fifth house: Person who drinks tea

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

Let's try Computer in house 1:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Gameboy

Now, place the television and phone:
- TV and Phone must be in houses 1-3.
- Since Computer is in house 1, TV and Phone must be in houses 2 and 3.

"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the percussionist cannot be in house 2, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.
- This leaves house 1 for the percussionist and house 2 for the grilled cheese eater.
- The remaining houses (1 and 2) must be occupied by the guitarist and the person who had pizza.

Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2, the guitarist and the person who had pizza must be in the remaining houses. Therefore, the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is 2.

"Given the constraints, let's analyze the placement of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The bird keeper lives in the third house.

2. **Clue 1**: The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Cat lover: House 1, 2, or 4

4. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
   - Convertible driver: House 2, 3, or 4

5. **Clue 5**: The baseball player does not live in the third house.
   - Baseball player: House 1, 2, or 4

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 5, as the convertible driver cannot be in the third house.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
   - This means the sedan owner cannot be in the first house and must be in a house to the right of the baseball player.

8. **Clue 8**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - Since the bird keeper lives in house 3, the soccer player must live in house 1, 2, or 4.

9. **Clue 9**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in a house to the left of the soccer player.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- Bird keeper: House 3
- Cat lover: House 1, 2, or 4
- Golfers and truck drivers: Not adjacent
- Convertible driver: House 2, 3, or 4
- Baseball player: House 1, 2, or 4
- Sedan owner: House 2, 3, or 4 (to the right of the baseball player)
- Soccer player: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the bird keeper)
- Fish enthusiast: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the soccer player)

Given Clue 2, the bird keeper is in house 3. Let's place the other constraints:

- Convertible driver cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Baseball player cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so if the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 4. If the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 3 (but house 3 is taken by the bird keeper).

Let's try placing the convertible driver in house 1:
- Convertible driver in house 1
- Baseball player in house 2 (since they cannot be in house 3)
- Sedan owner in house 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper and house 4 for the sedan owner. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the sedan owner, house 2 for the fish enthusiast, and house 3 for the bird keeper.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 9 and Clue 10, we can infer that the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses, respectively, or vice versa. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the second house (Clue 3), the flutist must be in the second house.

From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast must be in the third house or the first house. Since the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana (Clue 5), the person eating a banana must be in the first house. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.

From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house or the first house. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first house.

From Clue 6, the flutist must be in the second house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the third house. This leaves the first house for the person who is eating a banana.

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house, so the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house.

From Clue 2, the percussionist cannot be in the second house, so the percussionist must be in the first house or the third house. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the first house, the percussionist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the history book buff cannot be in the second house, so the history book buff must be in the first house or the third house. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the first house, the history book buff must be in the third house.

From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first house, which we already know.

From Clue 8, the fish enthusiast (in the third house) lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers is in the first house, which we already know.

From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first house, which we already know.

From Clue 10, the fantasy book enthusiast (in the first house) lives somewhere to the left of the flutist (in the second house). This is consistent with the arrangement.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

The number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is **3**.

   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4.

   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this clue is satisfied. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Kiwis

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the cat lover.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Person eating oranges
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we know:
- The mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2 (because house 2 is the only house to the right of house 1 and the only house where the person who had stew can be next to the mystery book reader).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means if the daffodils are in house \(X\), the phone must be in house \(X+1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who has a television lives in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the person with the television is in house \(X\), the person with the vase of tulips must be in house \(X-1\).

### Deductions

- From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.
- This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2.
- From Clue 1, the person with the daffodils must live in house 1 (since the root beer lover lives in house 1 and the daffodils must be directly left of the phone, which is in house 2).

So, we have:
- House 1: Root beer lover (bouquet of tulips)
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Person who likes root beer (bouquet of tulips) (but this contradicts Clue 3, so this must be a different person)

Since the root beer lover is in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2, and the person with the daffodils must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes root beer.

### Conclusion

The person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

Thus, the correct answer is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Wearing loafers

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - Phone: House 1, 2
   - Mangos: House 2, 3

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - Grapes: House 1, 2
   - Water: House 2, 3

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - Boots: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - Kiwis: House 1, 2
   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3
   - Boots must be in House 2 (since kiwis are in House 2)

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Combining Clues

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by someone wearing loafers.

From Clue 2, the phone and mangos must be in different houses, and the phone must be to the left of the mangos.

From Clue 3, grapes and water must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 4, boots cannot be in the third house.

From Clue 5, kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 6, boots must be to the right of the gameboy.

From Clue 7, kiwis cannot be in the first house.

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a computer. The person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints and the need to deduce the correct house number for the person who owns horses, let's reorganize and analyze the clues step by step:

1. **The golfer does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the golfer can live in houses 1 or 2.

2. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means if the fish enthusiast is in house 1, the person who owns horses must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 3.

3. **The golfer and the baseball player live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the golfer and the baseball player must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement and the baseball player must be in adjacent houses, and the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the left of the baseball player.

6. **The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the rose bouquet and the bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses, with the rose bouquet being to the left of the bouquet of daffodils.

7. **The cricketer does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the cricketer can live in houses 1 or 2.

Let's consider the possible placements for the golfer and the baseball player:

- If the golfer is in house 1, the baseball player must be in house 2.
- If the golfer is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1.

Now, let's analyze the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses:

- If the golfer is in house 1, the fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses).
  - This contradicts the fact that the golfer and the baseball player are in adjacent houses (golfer in house 1, baseball player in house 2).

- If the golfer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses).
  - This means the person who owns horses must be in house 2 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person who owns horses must be to the right of the fish enthusiast).

Given the above analysis, the only consistent placement is:
- Golfer in house 2
- Baseball player in house 1
- Fish enthusiast in house 1
- Person who owns horses in house 2

Thus, the person who owns horses lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating oranges.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the truck and convertible drivers must be in adjacent houses, and the truck driver must be to the left of the convertible driver.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the bird keeper and dog owner must be in houses with the bird keeper to the right of the dog owner.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not eating mangos.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Owning horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 3: Owning horses.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Eating oranges.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 3: Not eating mangos.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

Since the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), and the person driving a convertible must be adjacent to the person eating mangos (Clue 6), the only possible positions for the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible are:
- House 1: Eating oranges (Clue 1)
- House 2: Driving a convertible (Clue 6)
- House 3: Owning horses (Clue 5)

Now, we need to place the bird keeper and the dog owner. From Clue 3, the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are 2 and 3, but house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses. Therefore, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 1. Given that house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3.

Thus, the only remaining house for the person driving a truck is house 2.

### Conclusion

The person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"To determine the house where the percussionist lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This implies the mystery book reader and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

2. **Clue 3**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the percussionist.

3. **Clue 4**: There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second or fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader.

5. **Clue 6**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. This means the flutist must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

6. **Clue 7**: The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the guitarist and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist.

7. **Clue 8**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater must be in adjacent houses, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

8. **Clue 9**: There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the history book buff must be in the house directly to the right or left of the mystery book reader.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the saxophonist:
- The saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, so he must be in the second or fourth house.
- The mystery book reader must be directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in the second house and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in the first or second house.

Given the saxophonist is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, the only possible positions for the percussionist are the third or fourth house. Let's check the third house:
- If the percussionist is in the third house, the guitarist must be in the second house, which is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house because the mystery book reader is there.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or second house, but the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Finally, let's place the history book buff:
- The history book buff must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the flutist must be in the fourth house.

Finally, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Based on the given clues and the logical deductions made, the person who is eating mangos lives in the fifth house (House 5).

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - Given the positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

- **Dog owner cannot be in house 2.**
- **Carnations arrangement must be to the right of the bird keeper.**
- **Vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner.**

Let's consider the possible placements:

### Case 1: Dog owner in house 1
- Bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- Bird keeper must be in house 2 or 3.
- If bird keeper is in house 2, carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
- Dog owner in house 1, bird keeper in house 2, carnations arrangement in house 3.

### Case 2: Dog owner in house 3
- Bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
- Bird keeper must be in house 1 or 2.
- If bird keeper is in house 1, carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
- Dog owner in house 3, bird keeper in house 1, carnations arrangement in house 2.

This scenario is consistent:
- Dog owner in house 2.
- Bird keeper in house 1.
- Carnations arrangement in house 2.
- Vase of tulips in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

"Given the constraints and the need to deduce the correct placement of the person wearing sandals, let's reorganize the information step by step:

1. **House 4: Swimmer**
2. **House 3: Banana**
3. **House 2: Computer**
4. **House 1: Basketball Player**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This is because the banana eater cannot be in house 3, and the dog owner cannot be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses.

From Clue 5, the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2. Since the dog owner is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in adjacent houses. Since the person eating bananas is in house 1, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From Clue 4, the person who is eating a banana (in house 1) cannot be in house 3. Therefore, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3.

Since the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 1 (mango eater), and the person eating kiwis must be next to the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in house 2 and the person eating kiwis must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, dog owner, bird keeper.
- House 3: Not banana, eating kiwis.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff and the bird keeper must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the only possible adjacent houses are houses 2 and 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Romance book lover or bird keeper

From Clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house (since the romance book lover cannot live in the third house, and the bird keeper must be in an adjacent house).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

- From Clue 6, the kiwi eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1, 2, or 4.
- From Clue 2, the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, and the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker.
- From Clue 5, the apple eater must be to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's try to place the people based on these constraints:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The soccer player lives in the third house (house 3).
2. **Clue 11:** The person who likes green lives in the fifth house (house 5).
3. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house (house 3).

From Clue 12, we directly know that the person who is eating a banana lives in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the constraints and the refined persona, let's reanalyze the clues with a focus on the logical deductions:

1. **Stew and High Heels:**
   - The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with high heels cannot be in the third house, and the person with stew cannot be in the first house.

2. **Daffodils and Golfer:**
   - There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
   - This means the golfer cannot be in the first or third house, and the person with daffodils cannot be in the first or second house.

3. **Rose Bouquet and Spaghetti:**
   - The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person with spaghetti cannot be in the first house, and the person with rose bouquet cannot be in the third house.

4. **Mystery Book Reader:**
   - The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in the first or third house.

5. **History Book Buff and Stew:**
   - The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
   - This means the person with stew cannot be in the third house, and the person with history book buff cannot be in the first house.

6. **Running Shoes and Stew:**
   - The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person with running shoes cannot be in the first house, and the person with stew cannot be in the third house.

7. **Soccer Player:**
   - The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet cannot be in the second house.

### Deductions

  - The soccer player lives in the second house.

- **Stew and History Book Buff:**
  - Since the soccer player is in the second house, the person with stew cannot be in the second house.

- **Daffodils and Golfer:**
  - The person with daffodils cannot be in the first or second house.
  - The person with daffodils must be in the third house.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by considering the possible positions for the truck and the minivan based on Clue 5:

- If the truck is in house 1, the minivan must be in house 2 (since the minivan must be to the right of the truck).
- If the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 2 (Clue 3).
- If the minivan is in house 2, the person with the phone must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If the person with the phone is in house 1, the person with the television must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
- If the person with the television is in house 3, the person with high heels must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If the person with high heels is in house 2, the person with the gameboy must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- If the person with the gameboy is in house 3, the person with boots must be in house 1 (Clue 7).

This configuration contradicts Clue 1, as the person with the phone cannot be in house 1 if the person with the gameboy is in house 3. Therefore, the truck must be in house 3, and the minivan must be in house 2.

- If the truck is in house 3, the minivan must be in house 2.
- If the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 2 (Clue 3).
- If the minivan is in house 2, the person with the phone must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If the person with the phone is in house 1, the person with the television must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
- If the person with the television is in house 3, the person with high heels must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If the person with high heels is in house 2, the person with the gameboy must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- If the person with the gameboy is in house 1, the person with boots must be in house 3 (Clue 7).

This configuration is consistent with all the clues. Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 1.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the constraints and the information provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house (house 5).
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, so the pianist must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 13**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a television (house 3).
5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
6. **Clue 7**: The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

10. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
12. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 10, we know the pianist is in house 3 and the person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 1. From Clue 13, the person with the bouquet of daffodils is in house 2 and the person with the television is in house 3.

From Clue 11, the violinist and the person eating oranges are next to each other. Since the violinist is in house 3, the person eating oranges must be in house 4.

From Clue 12, the person eating oranges (house 4) is directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in house 5.

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos is to the right of the violinist. Since the violinist is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 5, but we already know the saxophonist is in house 5. This means the person eating mangos must be in house 4, making the saxophonist in house 5.

From Clue 7, the person with the gameboy and the guitarist are next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in house 5, the person with the gameboy must be in house 4 and the guitarist in house 3.

From Clue 3, the person with the gameboy (house 4) is to the left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the gameboy is in house 4, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 5.

From Clue 8, the person with the phone is to the left of the person with the radio. Since the person with the gameboy is in house 4, the person with the phone must be in house 3 and the person with the radio must be in house 2.

From Clue 1, the saxophonist (house 5) is to the left of the person with the vase of tulips. Since the saxophonist is in house 5, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 4.

From Clue 1, the saxophonist (house 5) is to the left of the person with the vase of tulips. Since the saxophonist is in house 5, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 4.

From Clue 5, the person eating apples must be in house 4.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the SUV lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the minivan person must be in house 2, and the person who had stew must be in house 1.
2. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. This confirms that the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 2, and the person who drives a truck must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

From the above deductions, we can conclude:
- House 1: Person who likes blue (rose bouquet)
- House 2: Person who has a rose bouquet (blue)
- House 3: Person who likes red (truck)

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the person who owns a sedan lives step by step:

1. **Clue 6:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 15:** The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.

14. **Clue 3:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
15. **Clue 13:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the soccer player lives in the second house. From Clue 8, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From Clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. From Clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From Clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From Clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. From Clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. From Clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

Now, let's summarize the known information:
- Second house: Flutist
- Third house: Cellist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV (and also the person who likes white)

Since the sedan owner cannot be in the second house (Clue 15) and the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must be in the first house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - This is already satisfied with the current placements.

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

From Clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

From Clue 9, the person who owns horses lives in house number 4.

From Clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

From Clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 (since the bird keeper is in house 2 and the dog owner must be in house 3 or 4).

5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 4, we know the saxophonist is in house 1. From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2 (Clue 2).

Now, combining Clue 1 and Clue 3:
- The baseball player and the person eating grapes must be in houses 1 and 2.
- Since the saxophonist is in house 1 and the golfer is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1 and the person eating grapes must be in house 2.

4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know that the first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots.

Since the first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots, the second house must be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

### Initial Setup

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Let's denote the people in the houses as follows:
- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

### Clue 3 Analysis

Clue 3 states that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

### Clue 1 and Clue 2 Analysis

Clue 1 states that the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.

Clue 2 states that the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, then Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.
- If Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, then Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.

### Combining Clues

Let's combine the information from Clue 3 and Clue 1:

- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes (Clue 1).

This creates a contradiction because Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow and eat grapes simultaneously. Therefore, Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow.

Thus, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

Now, let's use Clue 1 again:
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) wears boots (Clue 2).

This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

Finally, we need to determine the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the remaining characteristics are:
- Person 1 (House 1) likes red.
- Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow.
- Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.
- Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

The only remaining characteristic is the fantasy book enthusiast. Since Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader, Person 1 (House 1) must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

### Conclusion

The fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 1."

   - House 3: Red

4. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.

"Given the clues:

1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the violinist lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: ?

From Clue 3, the violinist lives in the second house, so the violinist is in House 2.

From Clue 1, the cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in House 3, because the cellist would then be in House 3, which would make the cellist to the left of the cricketer. Therefore, the cricketer must be in House 1, and the cellist must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the basketball player is in House 2. This leaves the soccer player to live in House 1 or House 3. But we already know the cricketer lives in House 1 and the cellist lives in House 3.

Therefore, the soccer player must live in House 1.

The number of the house where the soccer player lives is \boxed{A}."

- First house: Tennis player.
- First or second house: Fish enthusiast.

1. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
2. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
4. The soccer player does not live in the first house.
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
6. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
9. The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
10. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
11. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
12. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

From Clue 8, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. Therefore, house 2 is occupied by the person with daffodils.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since house 2 is occupied by the person with daffodils, the only possible pair for the vase of tulips and the baseball player is (1, 2) or (2, 3). However, house 2 is already occupied by the person with daffodils, so the pair must be (1, 2).

From Clue 10, the person who likes white does not live in the second house. Since house 2 is occupied by the person with daffodils, the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 3.

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the vase of tulips is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 or higher. Given that the person who likes white cannot be in house 2, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 1 (Clue 6), the person who likes white must be in house 3.

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person with daffodils is in house 2, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person with lilies must be in house 3 or higher, and the person who likes red must be in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 3.

From Clue 2, the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. Given that the soccer player cannot be in house 1 (Clue 4) and the cricketer must be in house 3 or higher, the soccer player must be in house 5, and the cricketer must be in house 4.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person with lilies is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2 or lower. Given that house 2 is occupied by the person with daffodils, the swimmer must be in house 1.

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white is in house 3, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 4 or higher. Given that the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 5.

Thus, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.

We can deduce the following:

- The violinist is in house 1.
- The person with a computer must be in house 1 (since house 1 is to the left of house 2).

This leaves house 2 for the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 2 must be the bird keeper (since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1).
- The person in house 2 must have a gameboy (since the computer is in house 1).
- The person in house 2 must be the guitarist (since the violinist is in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2).

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the bird keeper lives is (B) 2."
"Let's deduce the house where the person who has a computer lives based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house (house 2).
2. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in a house number greater than 2.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house (house 1).

18. **Clue 19**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
19. **Clue 20**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the first house (house 1).

- House 2: Boots (Clue 1)
- House 3: Television (Clue 12)
- House 4: Pizza (Clue 10)
- House 5: Spaghetti (Clue 5)

Since the person who had pizza (house 4) lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (house 5), we can confirm the order of houses 4 and 5.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person wearing boots lives in house 2.
2. The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner must live in house 1.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in house 3.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots, so the SUV owner lives in house 1.
5. The cat lover lives in house 1.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: High Heels (cat lover)
- House 2: Boots (person wearing boots)
- House 3: Sedan (person who owns a sedan)

Since the person wearing high heels lives in house 1 and the cat lover also lives in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be the cat lover. This leaves the person wearing running shoes to live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - House 1: Kiwis
   - House 2: Blue

3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - Since the tea drinker lives in House 3, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in Houses 1 and 2.
   - House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Person who likes green
   - House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Tulips

6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.
   - House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Person who likes green
   - House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges
   - House 3: Tea drinker

7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Person who likes green

8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
   - The person who is eating oranges must live in either House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 already has the person with carnations, the person who is eating oranges must live in House 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Person who likes green
- House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other, and the only remaining house for the person who likes milk is House 3, the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people and their devices in the houses as follows:

1. The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB).
2. The mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P).
4. The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV).

From Clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as Mystery Reader (MR), History Book Buff (HBB), and Science Fiction Fanatic (SFF).

From Clue 1, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the history book buff must be in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the history book buff (HBB), which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Since the mystery book reader (MR) is in the first house, the history book buff (HBB) must be in the third house. This means the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: ?
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the person who has a computer (C). So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: TV
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 3, the person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P). Since the person with the computer is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. This means the person with the phone is the mystery book reader (MR). This is consistent with Clue 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB (history book buff)

The person who has a phone is the mystery book reader (MR), and the person who has a computer is in the second house. The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic (SFF), who must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

Pigs, like any other non-human animals, do not possess the cognitive abilities to understand or produce human languages such as pig Latin. However, it is not impossible to teach a pig to respond to certain commands or perform specific actions, which can be considered a form of communication. Therefore, while pigs cannot use pig Latin in the traditional sense, they can be trained to perform tasks, which is a form of communication."

The 1936 Berlin Olympic Stadium, with a seating capacity of approximately 110,000, would be far too small to accommodate the typical Super Bowl crowd, which can exceed 70,000 spectators. The stadium was designed specifically for the 1936 Summer Olympics and was not built to handle such large crowds, making it significantly undersized for hosting a Super Bowl event."
"Based on my specialized knowledge of marine biodiversity in the Caribbean region, brown rockfish (Sebastes norvegicus) are not typically found in the waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis. These fish prefer colder waters in the North Atlantic, particularly in deeper areas with rocky bottoms. Therefore, the answer is:

(A) No"
"Growing seedless cucumbers might not be ideal for a gardener with entomophobia due to the potential presence of insects during the pollination process. Seedless cucumbers typically require pollination, which can involve bees and other insects. For a gardener with entomophobia, this could be a source of anxiety. Instead, a gardener with this condition might prefer to focus on growing regular cucumbers, which do not require pollination and thus do not involve insects. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"To determine if Martin Luther would run out of theses in half a year if he wrote one per day, we need to consider the number of days in half a year.

Half a year is equivalent to 182.5 days. If Martin Luther wrote one thesis per day, he would have written 182 theses in 182 days. On the 183rd day, he would have written his 183rd thesis.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"Given the ambiguity in the term ""slam dance,"" it is challenging to definitively compare the potential for injury between waltz and slam dance. However, based on general knowledge:

Waltz is a traditional dance form that typically involves slow, graceful movements and is generally considered a low-impact activity. It is less likely to cause significant injuries compared to more vigorous dance styles.

On the other hand, ""slam dance"" could refer to various dance styles, but if we consider a more energetic, potentially high-impact dance, it is more likely to be injurious.

Therefore, without a clear definition of ""slam dance,"" we cannot definitively state that waltz is less injurious. However, based on the typical understanding of waltz, it is generally less injurious than a slam dance.

Given the options:

(A) No

This option suggests that waltz is not necessarily less injurious than slam dance, which aligns with the uncertainty due to the lack of clarity in the term ""slam dance."""
"No, a 1943-S penny would not be good for making silverware. Pennies minted in 1943 are typically made of a copper-nickel alloy, not pure silver. Pure silver is the material used for silverware, and a 1943-S penny is not suitable for this purpose."
"(B) Yes

Snowboarding on Venus would be extremely difficult due to the planet's extreme conditions. Venus has a surface temperature of approximately 462°C (864°F) and a pressure that is about 92 times greater than Earth's at sea level. The atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it an inhospitable environment for snowboarding or any form of snow-related activity. The extreme heat, pressure, and corrosive nature of the atmosphere would make it impossible for snow to exist in a form suitable for snowboarding."
"The Battle of Tours, also known as the Battle of Poitiers, was fought in 732 between the Frankish forces led by Charles Martel and the Muslim forces led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. Charlemagne's father, Pepin the Short, was not directly involved in this battle. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Yes, euphoria is often associated with drug addiction. The intense feelings of pleasure and well-being that some drugs can induce are commonly referred to as euphoria. This sensation can be highly addictive and lead individuals to seek out the drug repeatedly to achieve the same high. However, it's important to understand that euphoria is not unique to drug use and can be experienced through various means, including positive social interactions, physical exercise, and certain types of art or music. In the context of drug addiction, the pursuit of this feeling often drives the compulsive use of the substance, despite potential negative consequences."
"Given the context of the fictional characters Apollo and D'Artagnan, it is challenging to definitively determine their combat abilities. However, based on the descriptions provided:

- Apollo is a god of prophecy and healing, known for his wisdom and supernatural powers.
- D'Artagnan is a musketeer from ""The Three Musketeers,"" known for his bravery, loyalty, and physical prowess.

Considering these descriptions, it is reasonable to assume that D'Artagnan, with his training and experience, would be a formidable opponent. However, without knowing the exact abilities of Apollo, it is difficult to definitively say whether he could defeat D'Artagnan.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer is:

The most expensive color in the world is not blue. While ultramarine, a deep blue pigment, is considered one of the most expensive due to its production process, which involves grinding lapis lazuli, the term ""most expensive color"" is often used more broadly to describe the high cost of certain shades or types of blue, such as ultramarine. However, the most expensive color in the world, in a more general sense, is not blue but rather a shade of red called preecha, which is used in the production of the Thai national flag. This color, known for its rarity and the difficulty in producing it, is indeed the most expensive color globally."

Therefore, the correct answer to the question ""Do you need lactobacillus to make pickles?"" is:

(A) Yes"
"The Wall Street Crash of 1929 primarily affected traditional industries and stocks, such as those in manufacturing, finance, and real estate.

Gandhi lived from 1869 to 1948, and television as we know it today did not exist during his lifetime. The first television broadcast in the United States was in 1938, and it was not until the 1950s that television became widely available and popular. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Gandhi, who lived before the advent of television, watched the show Bonanza, which aired from 1959 to 1973."

Paul Bunyan, known for his immense size and strength, would likely be an unsuitable choice for an urban planner. Urban planners require skills in land use, transportation, environmental sustainability, and community development, which are not directly related to physical strength. While Paul Bunyan's ability to clear forests might seem impressive, it does not translate to the practical and strategic skills needed for managing modern urban infrastructure, traffic, and environmental concerns. Therefore, his legendary attributes would not be beneficial in the field of urban planning."
"Yes

Parsley is a versatile herb that is often used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Its widespread use makes it a popular ingredient in many cuisines, which is why you might find it in various sections of a grocery store. Fresh parsley is typically found in the produce section, while dried parsley is usually located in the spice aisle. Some stores may also have a dedicated section for fresh herbs and spices, further emphasizing its prominence in the grocery store. Therefore, it is indeed normal to find parsley in multiple sections of a grocery store."

"Given the attributes of Iris and Hermes, we can analyze their suitability for a UPS job:

Iris, as the messenger of the gods, is known for her swift and direct communication, which is crucial in a UPS job where timely delivery is essential. She would excel in handling packages and ensuring they reach their destinations efficiently.

Hermes, the god of trade and commerce, is resourceful and quick-witted. However, he is also associated with thievery, which might not be ideal for a UPS job where integrity and reliability are paramount.

Considering these points, Iris would likely fit well into a UPS job, while Hermes might struggle with the more routine and detail-oriented aspects such as inventory management and customer service.

Therefore, the hypothetical struggle between Iris and Hermes at a UPS job would be more likely to be with Hermes, who might find the more mundane tasks challenging.

"Lactic acid is a normal byproduct of the body's metabolism, particularly during intense physical activity when oxygen supply to muscles is insufficient. While it can cause muscle fatigue and soreness, lactic acid is not inherently bad for the body. In fact, it plays a crucial role in energy production and muscle function. The body has mechanisms to manage and eliminate lactic acid, and it is not typically harmful in moderate amounts. However, excessive accumulation of lactic acid can lead to discomfort and fatigue. 

**Answer: (B) No**"
"The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed assassination attempt against King James I of England. Mary, Queen of Scots, was a Catholic and had been exiled from Scotland and imprisoned in England since 1568. She was accused of involvement in the Gunpowder Plot and was executed in 1587 by King James I. Therefore, the Gunpowder Plot did not directly eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline. Mary's daughter, Elizabeth of Knole, was born in 1585 and died in 1586, so the bloodline was not fully eliminated by the Gunpowder Plot. 

The correct answer is:

"To determine whether a bull shark bite hurts worse than a crocodile bite, we need to consider several factors, including the size and strength of the animals, the nature of their bites, and the potential for infection and tissue damage.

Bull sharks are known for their aggressive behavior and are capable of delivering powerful bites. They are found in various coastal and river environments, which increases the likelihood of encounters with humans. Bull shark bites can be severe due to their powerful jaws and the potential for causing significant tissue damage, infection, and other complications.

Crocodiles, while also capable of delivering powerful bites, are generally more selective about their prey. They are less likely to attack humans unless provoked or threatened. The severity of a crocodile bite can vary depending on the species and the size of the crocodile. However, crocodile bites can still be quite painful and can result in significant tissue damage.

Given these factors, it is difficult to definitively say that one bite is definitely worse than the other. Both bull shark and crocodile bites can be serious and painful. The severity of the injury would depend on various factors such as the size of the animal, the force of the bite, and the individual's response to the injury.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"(A) No

In the context of the fairy tale ""Snow White,"" Snow White is not an example of good consent. The story depicts a situation where Snow White is forced to leave her home by her parents and stepmother, which does not align with the concept of consent.

"Given Brooke Shields' well-known public profile and her achievements in acting and modeling, it is less likely that she would have succeeded at the University of Pennsylvania in the traditional sense of academic achievement. However, her success at Penn would not necessarily be measured by her academic performance alone.

The University of Pennsylvania is known for its rigorous academic standards and diverse student body, which might present challenges for someone not accustomed to such academic rigor.

A cattle farmer could be useful to a drum maker in several ways, leveraging their expertise and resources:

1. **Raw Materials**: Cattle farmers can provide leather, which is a critical component in drum making. Leather from cattle is commonly used for drum heads, drum skins, and other parts of the drum.

2. **Labor**: If the cattle farmer has a team of workers, they could assist with tasks such as preparing the leather, cutting, and assembling drum components.

3. **Networking**: The cattle farmer might have a network of suppliers or contacts that could be beneficial for sourcing materials or finding other resources needed for drum making.

These connections and resources can support the drum maker's business, making the cattle farmer a valuable partner."

"To determine if it is socially acceptable to wear an icon depicting crucifixion, we need to consider the context and the cultural or religious norms associated with such an icon. 

The crucifixion icon is a significant symbol in Christianity, representing the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Its use can vary widely depending on the setting:

- **Religious Context**: In a religious setting, such as a church or a place of worship, wearing a crucifixion icon is generally socially acceptable and even expected.
- **Secular Context**: In a secular setting, such as a workplace, public school, or in most public areas, wearing a crucifixion icon may not be socially acceptable due to the potential for it to be seen as a religious display in a non-religious context.

Given these considerations, the answer to whether it is socially acceptable to wear an icon depicting crucifixion depends on the specific context.

(A) Yes

This option would be correct if the context is a religious setting where such an icon is appropriate. However, in most secular contexts, the answer would be:

(B) No

This option would be correct if the context is a secular setting where the use of religious symbols is generally not accepted."

"To determine if binary numbers and the standard alphabet can satisfy the criteria for a strong password, we need to consider the key components of a strong password:

1. **Length**: A strong password should be at least 8 characters long.
2. **Character Variety**: A strong password should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Given these criteria:

- **Binary Numbers (0 and 1)**: These can only be used to represent digits, which limits the character variety.
- **Standard Alphabet (Letters a-z and A-Z)**: This includes both uppercase and lowercase letters, adding variety to the password.

Since binary numbers alone do not provide the necessary character variety (uppercase and lowercase letters), a password composed solely of binary numbers and the standard alphabet would not meet the criteria for a strong password.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"(A) No

Lunch on the beach is not an ideal setting for observing a full circle rainbow. Rainbows typically form as semi-circular arcs in the sky, and they require specific conditions such as sunlight passing through raindrops.

"To determine whether Bill Nye voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we need to consider the timeline of their lives and the voting age in the United States.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was the 32nd President of the United States, serving from 1933 to 1945. Bill Nye the Science Guy, whose real name is Bill Nye, was born on May 26, 1955. This means Bill Nye was not yet born when FDR was in office.

In the United States, the minimum age to vote is 18. Since Bill Nye was born in 1955, he would have turned 18 in 1973. Therefore, he could not have voted for FDR, who was president from 1933 to 1945.

Guitarists often develop calluses on their fingertips due to the repetitive action of playing guitar strings. These calluses can provide a protective layer that reduces the sensation of pain from the strings. However, the ability to handle pain is a broader physiological and psychological trait that is not directly influenced by the presence of calluses. Calluses do not enhance an individual's pain tolerance; they simply provide a barrier to the roughness of the strings. Therefore, a guitarist's fingers are not inherently better at handling pain than the average person."
"Given Kami Rita's extensive experience as a Sherpa mountaineer, including his successful summits of high peaks like Mount Everest, it would not be difficult for him to climb Mount Emei.

"To determine if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to consider the storage requirements for a single hour of Netflix content.

1. **Netflix Content Size**: Netflix typically streams content at a resolution of 1080p, which is a high-quality format. The size of a 1080p video file can vary, but generally, a single hour of high-quality video can range from 1.5GB to 3GB.

2. **Storage Requirement for 10 Hours**: If we take the average size of a 1080p video file as 2.5GB (which is a reasonable estimate), then 10 hours of video would require:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 2.5 \text{ GB/hour} = 25 \text{ GB}
   \]

3. **Comparison with USB Capacity**: A 500GB USB device has a storage capacity of 500GB.

Since 25GB is significantly less than the 500GB capacity of the USB device, a 500GB USB device is more than enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day.

"United Airlines was not blameless in the worst crash in history, which refers to the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 on July 19, 1989. The incident is considered one of the worst in aviation history. While the airline itself was not directly responsible for the crash, it faced significant criticism and scrutiny for its handling of the situation. United Airlines' management and leadership were heavily criticized for their response to the crisis, including their decision to land the aircraft at Sioux City Regional Airport rather than the nearest airport, which was 100 miles away. This decision was later found to have been made in a rush, without proper consultation with the pilots, and it contributed to the severity of the crash. Additionally, the company's reputation was damaged by the incident, and it faced significant financial and operational challenges as a result. Therefore, United Airlines was not blameless in the aftermath and the broader context of the incident.

"To determine if King Kong was climbing at a higher altitude than Eiffel Tower visitors, we need to compare their respective elevations.

1. **King Kong**: In the context of the films, King Kong is often depicted as being very tall, but for the purpose of this question, let's assume he is at a height of 30 meters (approximately 98 feet) when he climbs.

2. **Eiffel Tower Visitors**: The Eiffel Tower stands at a height of approximately 330 meters (1,083 feet) above sea level. The highest level accessible to visitors is the first level, which is about 57 meters (187 feet) above sea level.

Given these heights:
- King Kong is at 30 meters.

"To determine if a 1996 leap year baby would technically be 1 year old in 2000, we need to consider the nature of leap years and how age is calculated.

1. **1996 was a leap year**, which means February 1996 had 29 days.
2. **Age Calculation**: A person's age is determined by the number of years that have passed since their birth, not by the specific day of the year. Therefore, a person born on February 29, 1996, would turn 1 year old on February 28, 1997, because 1997 is not a leap year.
3. **2000 was a leap year**, but this does not affect the age of the individual born in 1996. The individual would still be 3 years old in 2000, having missed their birthday in 1997.

Thus, the correct answer is:

"To determine whether the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space than the Library of Congress, we need to consider the scale and scope of each library.

The Library of Alexandria, which existed from the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD, was one of the largest and most significant libraries in ancient times. It is estimated to have contained tens of thousands of scrolls, but the exact number and the physical space they occupied are not definitively known. The library was primarily focused on preserving and studying ancient texts, including works from various civilizations.

In contrast, the Library of Congress, established in 1800, is the largest library in the world. It is located in Washington, D.C., and houses over 170 million items, including books, manuscripts, and other materials. The physical space required to house these items is substantial, with the library occupying several buildings and covering a large area.

Given the vast difference in the number of items and the size of the collections, it is highly unlikely that the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space than the Library of Congress. The Library of Alexandria, while impressive, was much smaller in scale and scope compared to the Library of Congress.

Wool can typically be machine washed, but it's important to handle it with care. While hand washing is an option, many wool garments can be safely machine washed in a gentle cycle using a wool or delicates detergent. It's crucial to avoid using fabric softeners, as they can damage the wool fibers. When washing, use a gentle cycle and ensure the water temperature is not too hot. After washing, thoroughly rinse the wool to remove any detergent residue. For drying, air-dry the wool or use a low heat setting in a dryer. Ironing is also possible, but it's best to do so on a low heat setting and use a pressing cloth to protect the fabric."
"To determine whether the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in exceeded the number of Jesus's disciples, we need to compare the two numbers directly.

Reza Shah, as a Shia Muslim, believed in 12 Imams. This is a well-established fact in Shia Islamic tradition.

Jesus's disciples, according to the New Testament, were 12 apostles. This number is also consistently reported in Christian texts.

Comparing these numbers:
- Number of Imams Reza Shah believed in: 12
- Number of Jesus's disciples: 12

Since both numbers are equal, the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in does not exceed the number of Jesus's disciples.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"

"To determine whether the mongoose came from a later period than rhinos, we need to consider their evolutionary timelines.

Rhinos are part of the order Perissodactyla, which includes odd-toed ungulates like horses and tapirs. They have a long history dating back to the Eocene epoch, approximately 56 million years ago. Rhinos are considered to be among the oldest and most primitive of the large mammals.

Mongoose, on the other hand, are part of the family Herpestidae and are generally considered to be more recent in evolutionary terms. The mongoose family is thought to have evolved around 40-45 million years ago, which is relatively recent in the context of mammalian evolution.

Given this information, we can conclude that the mongoose came from a later period than the rhinos.

The Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453, was a series of conflicts between the House of Lancaster in England and the House of Plantagenet in France. Since Cesare Borgia lived long after the end of the Hundred Years' War, he did not play a key role in that conflict."

"To determine if the number of states in Ancient Greece was underwhelming compared to the number of states in the United States in 1900, we need to compare the two numbers directly.

1. **Ancient Greece**: Ancient Greece is often considered to have had 13 city-states.
2. **United States in 1900**: In 1900, the United States had 45 states.

Comparing these numbers:
- Ancient Greece: 13 states

"During the pandemic, door-to-door advertising can indeed be considered inconsiderate for several reasons:

1. **Health Risks**: Door-to-door canvassing involves close contact with individuals, which can increase the risk of spreading the virus, especially if the person being approached is at higher risk due to age or pre-existing health conditions.

2. **Social Distancing**: The practice of door-to-door canvassing often involves standing close to people's homes, which goes against the social distancing guidelines recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.

3. **Public Health Concerns**: During a pandemic, public health officials are urging people to stay at home and limit their interactions to reduce the spread of the virus. Door-to-door canvassing can be seen as a disruption to this effort.

4. **Privacy Concerns**: People may feel uncomfortable or annoyed by door-to-door canvassing, especially if they are already dealing with stress and anxiety related to the pandemic.

Given these points, the correct answer to the question ""During the pandemic, is door-to-door advertising considered inconsiderate?"" is:

(A) Yes"

An American would not confuse breakfast in British cuisine for dinner. Breakfast in British cuisine is traditionally eaten in the morning, around 7-9 AM, and is considered a substantial meal. Dinner, on the other hand, is the main meal of the day in British culture, typically eaten in the evening, around 6-8 PM. These meal times and their cultural significance are generally well understood and respected in the United States, making it unlikely for an American to confuse breakfast with dinner."

A lifeboat is primarily designed for rescue operations in maritime emergencies, such as when a ship is sinking or when crew members or passengers need to be evacuated from the water. The Hooke Sea, without additional context about its conditions or dangers, does not provide sufficient information to determine if a lifeboat would be suitable for rescue operations. Lifeboats are not typically used to rescue people from the open sea in general, especially if there are no immediate threats or if the sea is not specifically known to be dangerous. Therefore, a lifeboat cannot be assumed to rescue people in the Hooke Sea unless it is known to be a dangerous body of water or there is an immediate need for rescue."

To provide a more detailed and authoritative response, I will elaborate on why the swallow does not play a significant role in the film ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"":

""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a comedy film that parodies various elements of medieval and Arthurian legends. While the film is filled with memorable characters and humorous scenarios, the character of a swallow is not a part of the main narrative or plot. The film's humor often involves absurd situations and characters, but it does not include a character specifically named a swallow or one that plays a crucial role in the story. Therefore, the answer to whether the swallow played a role in the film is definitively ""No."""

"To determine whether it is more expensive to run for President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11, we need to consider the costs involved in each scenario:

1. **Running for President of India:**
   - The cost of running for President of India can vary widely. It typically includes campaign expenses, legal fees, security costs, and administrative expenses. In India, the cost can range from a few million to tens of millions of Indian Rupees (INR) or more, depending on the candidate's resources and the scale of the campaign. For the sake of comparison, let's assume a conservative estimate of ₹10 million (approximately $14,000 USD).

2. **Buying a new iPhone 11:**
   - The cost of a new iPhone 11 in India is approximately ₹70,000 (approximately $950 USD).

Comparing these two costs:
- Running for President of India: ₹10 million (approximately $14,000 USD)
- Buying a new iPhone 11: ₹70,000 (approximately $950 USD)

Clearly, the cost of running for President of India is significantly higher than the cost of buying a new iPhone 11.

Carlos Gracie is known to have had 11 children, and Helio Gracie is known to have had 10 children. Adding these numbers together, we get:

11 (Carlos's children) + 10 (Helio's children) = 21 children in total.

Since 21 is more than 13, the Gracie founders indeed had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To determine whether Harry Potter or The Matrix was a better investment for Warner Bros., we need to consider several financial and market factors. Both franchises have been successful, but their investment outcomes can vary based on specific metrics such as box office performance, merchandise sales, and streaming rights.

The Harry Potter franchise has grossed over $7.7 billion worldwide, with a significant portion of that coming from the box office. The series has also generated substantial revenue through merchandise, theme parks, and streaming rights. Warner Bros. has continued to invest in the Harry Potter universe, indicating its perceived value.

The Matrix, on the other hand, has grossed over $3.7 billion worldwide. While it has also seen success in merchandise and streaming, its box office performance has been more sporadic compared to the Harry Potter series. Warner Bros. has also continued to invest in the Matrix universe, suggesting its value to the company.

Given these factors, Warner Bros. likely saw value in both franchises. Therefore, the answer to whether Harry Potter was a better investment than The Matrix is:
