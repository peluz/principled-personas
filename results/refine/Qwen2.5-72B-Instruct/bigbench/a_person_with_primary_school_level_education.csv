"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **The flutist lives in the second house.**
   - So, the second house has the flutist.

2. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the person with tulips is in the house just before the guitarist. If the flutist is in the second house, the person with tulips can't be in the second house. So, the person with tulips must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the third house.

3. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the person with lilies is in the house just before the person with carnations. Since the guitarist is in the third house, the person with lilies must be in the third house, and the person with carnations must be in the fourth house.

4. **There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.**
   - The flutist is in the second house, so the pianist must be in the fourth house (one house away from the second house).

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:** Tulips
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Guitarist, Lilies
- **House 4:** Carnations, Pianist

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

The answer is:
(C) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle! We have three houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and have. We need to figure out where the person who plays the cello lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The person who drinks root beer lives to the left of the person who eats grapes.
2. The person with the TV lives to the left of the person who drinks root beer.
3. The person who drinks water lives to the left of the person who drinks root beer.
4. There is one house between the person who plays the cello and the person with the gameboy.
5. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
6. The person who likes blue and the person with the gameboy live next to each other.
7. The person who plays the drums (percussion) doesn't live in the second house.
8. The person who eats kiwis lives in the first house.

Let's start by writing down what we know for each house:

- **House 1:**
  - Likes green
  - Eats kiwis

- **House 2:**
  - (We don't know yet)

- **House 3:**
  - (We don't know yet)

Now, let's use the clues one by one:

1. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house. We already know this.
2. **Clue 8:** The person who eats kiwis lives in the first house. We already know this too.

So, House 1 has someone who likes green and eats kiwis.

3. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person with the gameboy live next to each other. This means the person who likes blue and the person with the gameboy must be in House 2 and House 3, but we don't know which is which yet.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between the person who plays the cello and the person with the gameboy. This means the person who plays the cello and the person with the gameboy cannot be next to each other. So, if the person with the gameboy is in House 3, the person who plays the cello must be in House 1.

5. **Clue 7:** The person who plays the drums (percussion) doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who plays the drums must be in House 1 or House 3. Since the person who plays the cello is in House 1, the person who plays the drums must be in House 3.

6. **Clue 2:** The person with the TV lives to the left of the person who drinks root beer. Since the person who plays the cello is in House 1, the person with the TV must be in House 1.

7. **Clue 3:** The person who drinks water lives to the left of the person who drinks root beer. Since the person who drinks water must be to the left of the person who drinks root beer, and the person who drinks root beer is in House 3, the person who drinks water must be in House 2.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who drinks root beer lives to the left of the person who eats grapes. Since the person who drinks root beer is in House 3, the person who eats grapes must be in House 2.

Now, let's fill in the rest:

- **House 1:**
  - Likes green
  - Eats kiwis
  - Plays cello
  - Has TV

- **House 2:**
  - Likes blue
  - Drinks water
  - Eats grapes

- **House 3:**
  - Has gameboy
  - Plays drums
  - Drinks root beer

So, the person who plays the cello lives in House 1.

The answer is: \(\boxed{1}\)"
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out where the person who likes green lives. Let's go through the clues one by one and see what we can find out.

1. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.

19. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Let's start filling in what we know:

- House 5: Kiwis, Tennis player
- House 2: Red, Cricketer (because the person who likes red lives in the second house and they live next to the cricketer)
- House 4: Running shoes (because the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house)

Now, let's use more clues:

- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana. So, if the person in House 1 is wearing sandals, the person in House 2 must be eating a banana.
- But we already know the person in House 2 likes red and is a cricketer, so the person in House 1 must be wearing sandals and the person in House 2 must be eating a banana.
- The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. So, the person in House 3 must be the baseball player, and the person in House 4 must be eating oranges.
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. So, the person in House 4 must be the tea drinker, and the person in House 5 must be the tennis player (which we already knew).

Now we have:
- House 1: Sandals, Banana
- House 2: Red, Cricketer, Banana
- House 3: Baseball player, Oranges
- House 4: Running shoes, Tea drinker, Oranges
- House 5: Kiwis, Tennis player

Let's use more clues:

- The root beer lover does not live in the first or third house. So, the root beer lover must be in House 4.
- The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. So, the person in House 5 must be eating grapes.

Now we have:
- House 1: Sandals, Banana
- House 2: Red, Cricketer, Banana
- House 3: Baseball player, Oranges
- House 4: Running shoes, Tea drinker, Root beer lover, Oranges
- House 5: Kiwis, Tennis player, Water, Grapes

Let's use the last clues:

- The person who likes white does not live in the third house. So, the person in House 1 must like white.
- The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue. So, the person in House 2 must be the coffee drinker, and the person in House 3 must like blue.
- The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. So, the person in House 5 must like green.

So, the person who likes green lives in House 5.

The answer is:

2. **The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.**
   - This means if loafers are in House 1, the convertible is in House 2. If loafers are in House 2, the convertible is in House 3. If loafers are in House 3, the convertible is in House 4.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.**
   - So, House 3 has high heels.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:**
  - Apples (Clue 9)
  - Pizza (Clue 12, because the pizza and mangos are next to each other)
  - Truck (Clue 6, because the truck is to the left of fried rice)

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person who likes different drinks and ate different foods for lunch. We need to figure out who ate what and where they live based on the clues given.

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - So, House 5: Grilled Cheese

2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Not Pizza

   - So, House 5: Water, Grilled Cheese

5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, with the coffee drinker on the left.

6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Spaghetti

7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are next to each other.

Now, let's put the pieces together:

- House 5: Water, Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 5, the coffee drinker must be in House 2 because they live directly left of the person in House 3 who ate spaghetti.

- House 2: Coffee

From Clue 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 because they live directly left of the person who had stew, and House 2 is already taken by the coffee drinker.

- House 1: Root Beer

From Clue 7, the person who had stew must be in House 4 because they live next to the person who likes milk, and House 2 is already taken by the coffee drinker.

- House 4: Stew

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk must be in House 5 because they live next to the person who had stew, and House 3 is already taken by the person who ate spaghetti.

- House 5: Milk, Water, Grilled Cheese

Now, we need to figure out what the person in House 1 ate for lunch. Since House 1 is the only house left and the only food left is pizza:

- House 1: Root Beer, Pizza

Finally, we need to figure out what the person in House 4 drinks. Since House 4 is the only house left and the only drink left is tea:

- House 4: Stew, Tea

So, the final arrangement is:

- House 1: Root Beer, Pizza
- House 2: Coffee
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Stew, Tea
- House 5: Milk, Water, Grilled Cheese

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 5. So, the answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person who plays a different sport, eats a different fruit, and has different flowers. We need to figure out where the person with the daffodils lives.

Here are the clues:
1. The soccer player lives to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The swimmer and the person with daffodils live next to each other.
3. The person with tulips lives to the right of the person eating mangos.
4. The person with daffodils lives to the right of the person eating oranges.

Let's start with the houses:
- House 1
- House 2
- House 3

### Step 1: Place the person eating oranges
From clue 1, the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges can't be in House 1 (because there's no house to the left of House 1). So, the person eating oranges must be in House 2 or House 3.

### Step 2: Place the person with daffodils
From clue 4, the person with daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges. This means the person with daffodils can't be in House 1 (because there's no house to the right of House 1). So, the person with daffodils must be in House 2 or House 3.

### Step 3: Place the swimmer
From clue 2, the swimmer and the person with daffodils live next to each other. If the person with daffodils is in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 1. If the person with daffodils is in House 3, the swimmer must be in House 2.

### Step 4: Combine the clues
- If the person with daffodils is in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 1. But then the person eating oranges can't be in House 2 (because the person with daffodils is there), and they can't be in House 1 (because the swimmer is there). So, this doesn't work.
- If the person with daffodils is in House 3, the swimmer must be in House 2. The person eating oranges can be in House 1 (because the person with daffodils is in House 3, which is to the right).

### Step 5: Place the soccer player
From clue 1, the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges. If the person eating oranges is in House 1, the soccer player must be in House 1. But this doesn't work because the swimmer is in House 2. So, the person eating oranges must be in House 1, and the soccer player must be in House 1.

### Step 6: Place the person with tulips
From clue 3, the person with tulips is to the right of the person eating mangos. The person eating mangos can't be in House 3 (because the person with daffodils is there), so they must be in House 2. The person with tulips must be in House 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, eating oranges, no flowers
- House 2: Swimmer, eating mangos, no flowers
- House 3: Swimmer, eating mangos, daffodils

The person with daffodils lives in House 3.

The answer is: **(C) 3**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out where the person with the tulips lives.

1. **The violinist lives in the first house.** (Clue 7)
   - So, the first house has the violinist.

2. **The person with the daffodils lives to the left of the percussionist.** (Clue 3)
   - Since the violinist is in the first house, the daffodils must be in the first house too, and the percussionist must be in the second or third house.

3. **The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the percussionist.** (Clue 2)
   - The percussionist can't be in the third house because there's no house to the right of it. So, the percussionist must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house.

4. **The person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the second house.** (Clue 1)
   - Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.

5. **The person with the tulips and the person with the phone live next to each other.** (Clue 6)
   - The daffodils are in the first house, so the tulips must be in the second house, and the phone must be in the third house.

6. **There is one house between the person with the radio and the history book buff.** (Clue 5)
   - The phone is in the third house, so the radio must be in the first house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

7. **The mystery book reader lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.** (Clue 4)
   - The history book buff is in the third house, so the mystery book reader must be in the second house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

So, let's put it all together:
- **First House:** Violinist, Daffodils, Spaghetti, Radio, Science Fiction
- **Second House:** Percussionist, Tulips, Mystery
- **Third House:** Fried Rice, Phone, History Book

The person with the tulips lives in the second house.

The answer is: **(B) 2**."

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who drives a convertible lives next to the person who likes history books.
2. The person who wears boots doesn't live in the first house.

Let's break it down:

1. **Convertible and History Books:**
   - The person who drives a convertible lives next to the person who likes history books.
   - This means the person who drives a convertible must live in House 1, and the person who likes history books must live in House 2.

2. **Boots:**
   - The person who wears boots doesn't live in the first house.
   - So, the person who wears boots must live in House 2.

Since the person in House 2 wears boots, the person in House 1 must wear sandals.

So, the person who wears sandals lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person who likes a different kind of book and plays a different sport. We need to figure out where the basketball player lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The swimmer lives next to the person who likes romance books.
2. The basketball player doesn't live in the last house (house 4).
3. The person who likes mystery books lives next to the person who likes history books.
4. The swimmer doesn't live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

Let's start with what we know for sure:
- The golfer is in house 1.

Now, let's use the other clues:
- The swimmer can't be in house 3 (clue 4), so the swimmer must be in house 2.
- Since the swimmer is in house 2, the person who likes romance books must be in house 3 (clue 1).

Next, we know:
- The person who likes mystery books must be next to the person who likes history books (clue 3). Since the golfer is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 3.

But wait, we already said the swimmer is in house 2, so let's adjust:
- The mystery book reader must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Swimmer (and mystery book reader)
- House 3: History book buff (and romance book lover)

The only house left for the basketball player is house 3, but we need to check if this fits all the clues:
- The basketball player can't be in house 4 (clue 2), so house 3 is the only option left.

So, the basketball player lives in house 3.

The answer is: **(A) 3**."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person who likes a different kind of book and wears different shoes. We need to figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the second house.
2. The person who likes history books lives to the right of the person wearing loafers.
3. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
4. The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the fourth house.
5. The person wearing sandals lives right next to the person who likes romance books.

Now, let's use clue 3:
- The mystery book reader lives in the third house.

So, the answer is:
(B) 3

That's where the mystery book reader lives!"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person with a different device and a favorite color. We need to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who likes green lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives next to the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house.

Let's start with the second clue:
- The person with the gameboy is next to the person with the computer.
- This means the gameboy and computer must be in houses that are next to each other.

So, the possible pairs are:
- House 1 (gameboy) and House 2 (computer)
- House 2 (gameboy) and House 3 (computer)

Now, let's use the first clue:
- The person who likes green lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
- This means the person who likes green must be in the house next to the gameboy.

If the gameboy is in House 1, then the person who likes green must be in House 2.
If the gameboy is in House 2, then the person who likes green must be in House 1.

But we also have the third clue:
- The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house.

So, let's check our options:
- If the gameboy is in House 1 and the person who likes green is in House 2, then the person in House 3 must like yellow (because yellow can't be in House 2).
- If the gameboy is in House 2 and the person who likes green is in House 1, then the person in House 3 must like yellow, but this would mean yellow is in House 3, which is fine.

So, the only arrangement that fits all the clues is:
- House 1: Green, Gameboy
- House 2: Blue, Computer
- House 3: Yellow, Phone

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with different likes. We need to figure out where the coffee drinker lives. Here are the clues we have:

1. There are two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker.
2. The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The history book buff doesn't live in the fourth house.
4. The romance book lover doesn't live in the first house.

7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. The tea drinker doesn't live in the second house.

Let's start filling in what we know:

- House 3: Red, Root Beer (from Clue 5 and Clue 7)
- The romance book lover can't be in the first house (Clue 4), so they must be in the second or third house. But the third house is already taken, so:
  - House 2: Romance
- The history book buff must be next to the romance book lover (Clue 8), so:
  - House 1: History
- The mystery book reader can't be in the fourth house (Clue 6), so they must be in the first, second, or third house. But the first and second houses are already taken, so:
  - House 4: Mystery
- The person who likes white and the coffee drinker must have two houses between them (Clue 1). The only way this can happen is if:
  - House 1: White
  - House 4: Coffee
- The coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green (Clue 2). Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes green must be in the first, second, or third house. But the first and third houses are already taken, so:
  - House 2: Green

Now, let's check the tea drinker. They can't be in the second house (Clue 9), so they must be in the first or fourth house. But the fourth house is already the coffee drinker, so:
  - House 1: Tea

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: White, History, Tea
- House 2: Green, Romance
- House 3: Red, Root Beer
- House 4: Green, Coffee, Mystery

The coffee drinker lives in House 4.

The answer is: **(B) 4**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. **The person who likes green lives next to the person who has a radio.**
   - This means the person who likes green is in house 1, and the person with the radio is in house 2.

2. **The person who likes fantasy books lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in house 1 likes fantasy books.

3. **The person who likes fish does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person in house 2 likes fish.

4. **The person who had pizza for lunch does not live in the first house.**
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza for lunch.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Likes green, likes fantasy books, has a phone (because the person in house 2 has a radio).
- House 2: Has a radio, likes fish, had pizza for lunch.

Since the person in house 2 likes fish, the person in house 1 must like cats (because there are only two pets, and one is a fish).

So, the cat lover lives in house 1.

The answer is:
(A) 1"

- **House 1**: Flute, kiwis, cats
- **House 2**: Guitar
- **House 3**: (We don't know yet)
- **House 4**: (We don't know yet)

From **Clue 4**, the person who drinks milk and the person who drinks water live next to each other. Since the person who drinks milk can't be in House 1 (Clue 6) or House 3 (Clue 7), they must be in House 2. So, the person who drinks water must be in House 3.

- **House 1**: Flute, kiwis, cats
- **House 2**: Guitar, milk
- **House 3**: Water
- **House 4**: (We don't know yet)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Rose and Grilled Cheese**: The person with the rose bouquet lives right next to the person who ate grilled cheese. So, if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, and so on.

2. **Oranges and Apples**: The person eating oranges lives to the left of the person eating apples. So, oranges are in a house with a lower number than apples.

3. There's one house between the horse owner and the person with carnations.
4. The person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

Let's start with what we know for sure:

- **House 1:** Cat lover

Now, let's use the clues one by one:

1. **Clue 1:** The person with tulips lives right next to the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 2, and the dog owner must be in house 3.

   - **House 1:** Cat lover
   - **House 2:** Tulips
   - **House 3:** Dog owner

2. **Clue 2:** The person with daffodils doesn't live in the second house. So, the person with daffodils must be in house 1, 3, or 4. But house 1 has the cat lover, and house 3 has the dog owner, so the person with daffodils must be in house 4.

   - **House 1:** Cat lover
   - **House 2:** Tulips
   - **House 3:** Dog owner
   - **House 4:** Daffodils

3. **Clue 3:** There's one house between the horse owner and the person with carnations. The only way this can work is if the horse owner is in house 4 and the person with carnations is in house 2.

   - **House 2:** Tulips, Carnations
   - **House 3:** Dog owner
   - **House 4:** Daffodils, Horses

4. **Clue 4:** The person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner. Since the horse owner is in house 4, the person with lilies must also be in house 4.

   - **House 3:** Dog owner
   - **House 4:** Daffodils, Horses, Lilies

The answer is: **(A) 2**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. **The person with the phone lives in the first house.**
   - So, the first house has a phone.

2. **The person wearing boots doesn't live in the second house.**
   - This means the person in the first house is wearing boots.

3. **The person with horses and the person with a radio live next to each other.**
   - Since there are only two houses, they must be in House 1 and House 2.

Now, let's put this together:
- House 1: Phone, Boots
- House 2: Not Boots

Since the person in House 1 is wearing boots, the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

Next, we need to figure out the pets and the devices:
- House 1: Phone, Boots
- House 2: High Heels

From the third clue, the person with horses and the person with a radio live next to each other. Since the person in House 1 has a phone, they can't have a radio. So, the person in House 1 must have horses, and the person in House 2 must have a radio.

So, we have:
- House 1: Phone, Boots, Horses
- House 2: High Heels, Radio

The only pet left for House 2 is a dog. So, the person in House 2 has a dog.

To sum it up:
- House 1: Phone, Boots, Horses

So, the person wearing high heels lives in House 2.

The answer is: **(A) 2**."

3. **Combining Clues 1 and 9:**
   - If the computer is in the second house, grilled cheese must be in the first house.
   - If the computer is in the first house, grilled cheese must be in the second house.
   - But loafers can't be in the third house, so the computer must be in the first house, and grilled cheese must be in the second house.
   - Therefore, loafers are in the second house.

4. **Phone and Computer:**
   - The person with the computer is in the first house.
   - The person with the phone is in the second house.

6. **Apples:**
   - Apples are not in the first house, so they must be in the second or third house.
   - But the third house has pizza, so apples must be in the second house.

7. **Mangos and Yellow:**
   - Mangos are directly to the left of yellow.
   - Mangos must be in the first house, and yellow must be in the second house.

8. **Blue and Phone:**
   - There's one house between blue and the phone.
   - The phone is in the second house, so blue must be in the first house.

9. **Boots and Grapes:**
   - Grapes are to the right of boots.
   - Boots must be in the first house, and grapes must be in the third house.

10. **Green:**
    - The only color left is green, and the only house left is the third house.

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person who plays a different sport and has a different pet. We need to figure out where the bird keeper lives. Here are the clues:

1. The basketball player doesn't live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer.

7. The bird keeper doesn't live in the third house.

Let's start with what we know for sure:

- The baseball player is in the second house (Clue 3).

Now, let's use the other clues:

- The basketball player can't be in the first house (Clue 1), and they must be to the left of the swimmer (Clue 2). So, the basketball player can only be in the second or third house. But the second house is already taken by the baseball player, so the basketball player must be in the third house.
- The swimmer must be in the fourth house because the basketball player is in the third house and must be to the left of the swimmer.

So far, we have:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Basketball player
- House 4: Swimmer

Next, let's look at the pets:

- The tennis player lives directly to the left of the cat lover (Clue 6). The only houses left are the first and second houses. But the second house is already taken by the baseball player, so the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house.
- The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner (Clue 4). The only houses left for the dog owner and fish enthusiast are the first and second houses. But the tennis player (dog owner) is in the first house, so the fish enthusiast must be in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Tennis player (dog owner)
- House 2: Baseball player (fish enthusiast)
- House 3: Basketball player
- House 4: Swimmer

Finally, the bird keeper:
- The bird keeper can't be in the first house (Clue 5) or the third house (Clue 7). So, the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 4.

The answer is: (C) 4"

### Let's Start Solving:
1. **Sedan and SUV:**
   - From clue 3, the sedan owner is next to the SUV owner.
   - So, the sedan owner could be in house 1 and the SUV owner in house 2, or the sedan owner in house 2 and the SUV owner in house 3.
   - From clue 4, the swimmer is to the right of the SUV owner, so the SUV owner can't be in house 3.
   - Therefore, the sedan owner is in house 1 and the SUV owner is in house 2.

2. **Gameboy:**
   - From clue 6, the gameboy owner is next to the sedan owner.
   - Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the gameboy owner must be in house 2.

3. **Baseball Player and Blue Lover:**
   - From clue 2, there is one house between the baseball player and the person who likes blue.
   - The sedan owner is in house 1, so the baseball player can't be in house 1.
   - Therefore, the baseball player must be in house 3, and the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

4. **White Lover:**
   - From clue 1, the person who likes white is to the right of the person with the computer.
   - The person with the computer can't be in house 3, so they must be in house 2.

7. The person eating oranges lives directly to the left of the person with the television.

### Let's Break It Down:

1. **Pianist's House:**
   - The pianist can't be in the first house, so they must be in the second or third house.

2. **Oranges and Kiwis:**
   - The person eating oranges is to the right of the person eating kiwis. So, if the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person eating oranges must be in the second or third house.

3. **High Heels and Pianist:**
   - The person wearing high heels and the pianist are next to each other. If the pianist is in the second house, the person wearing high heels must be in the first or third house.

6. **Radio and High Heels:**
   - The person with the radio is to the left of the person wearing high heels. So, if the person with the radio is in the first house, the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

7. **Oranges and Television:**
   - The person eating oranges is directly to the left of the person with the television. So, if the person eating oranges is in the second house, the person with the television must be in the third house.

  - The percussionist (because they must be next to the person wearing running shoes).

- **House 2:**
  - The person eating oranges (because they must be to the right of the person eating kiwis).
  - The person wearing high heels (because they must be next to the pianist).
  - The pianist (because they must be next to the person wearing high heels).

- **House 3:**
  - The person with the television (because they must be to the right of the person eating oranges).
  - The person wearing boots (because they must be to the right of the person eating kiwis).
  - The violinist (because they are the only one left).

So, the person with the television lives in house 3.

- The person who likes red lives to the left of the person who drinks water (clue 9), so the person who likes red must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who drinks water must be in House 2 or 3.
- The person with the convertible lives to the left of the person who likes red (clue 10), so the person with the convertible must be in House 1, and the person who likes red must be in House 2.

Next, let's use clues 1 and 2:
- The person who drives a truck can't live in the third house.
- The person who owns an SUV can't live in the third house.
- This means the person in the third house must drive a convertible.

So, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis, SUV or convertible
- House 3: Convertible

Now, let's use clue 4:
- The person in the second house can't eat a banana.

Since the person in the first house is eating kiwis, the person in the second house must be eating mangoes (because the only fruits left are mangoes and bananas, and the second house can't have bananas).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangoes
- House 3: Convertible, Banana

Now, let's figure out the cars:
- The person in the first house can't drive a truck (clue 3), so they must drive an SUV.

- House 2: Cricketer, Spaghetti
- House 3: Fried Rice

- **House 3:** The person who likes milk (Clue 4).

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives next to the person with the SUV. Since the person with running shoes is in House 2, the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the SUV must be in House 2.

- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover (House 1) and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other. So, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

- **Clue 2:** The person with loafers lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in House 1 (root beer lover) or House 2 (fried rice), they must be in House 4. So, the person with loafers must be in House 3.

- **Clue 8:** The person with the convertible lives next to the person who drinks water. Since the person who drinks water can't be in House 1 (root beer lover) or House 2 (fried rice), they must be in House 4. So, the person with the convertible must be in House 3.

- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the first house. Since the person with the sedan is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3.

So, let's put it all together:

- **House 2:** Wearing running shoes, ate fried rice, owns an SUV.
- **House 3:** Wearing loafers, likes milk, ate spaghetti, drives a convertible.
- **House 4:** Ate grilled cheese, drinks water.

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 1.

The answer is: **(B) 1**."
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have four houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out where the cellist lives. Let's go through the clues one by one:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person who likes different things. We need to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives. Here are the clues we have:

1. The coffee drinker and the tennis player have one house between them.
2. The daffodils and lilies are next to each other.
3. The swimmer lives right next to the sedan.

10. The root beer lover is in the third house.

Let's start with what we know for sure:

- The minivan is in the fourth house.
- The root beer lover is in the third house.

So, we can write it like this:
1. ?
2. ?
3. Root beer lover
4. Minivan

Now, let's use the other clues:

- The swimmer doesn't live in the first house, so they must be in the second or third house. But the third house is the root beer lover, so the swimmer must be in the second house.
- The swimmer is next to the sedan, so the sedan must be in the third house.

So now we have:
1. ?
2. Swimmer
3. Sedan (Root beer lover)
4. Minivan

- The basketball player is next to the truck, and the truck is next to the carnations. The only place for the basketball player and the truck is in the first and second houses. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the first house, and the truck must be in the second house.

So now we have:
1. Basketball player
2. Truck (Swimmer)
3. Sedan (Root beer lover)
4. Minivan

- The lilies are to the right of the basketball player, so the lilies must be in the second house.
- The daffodils are next to the lilies, so the daffodils must be in the first house.

So now we have:
1. Basketball player (Daffodils)
2. Truck (Swimmer, Lilies)
3. Sedan (Root beer lover, Carnations)
4. Minivan

- The tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker, and there is one house between the coffee drinker and the tennis player. The only place for the tennis player is the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the first house. The coffee drinker must be in the fourth house.

So now we have:
1. Basketball player (Daffodils, Tea drinker)
2. Truck (Swimmer, Lilies, Tennis player)
3. Sedan (Root beer lover, Carnations)
4. Minivan (Coffee drinker)

So, the person who drives a truck lives in the second house.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books.
4. There is one house between the person who likes fantasy books and the person who drinks coffee.
5. The person who eats oranges does not live in the second house.

### Let's Start Solving:
1. **First House:**
   - From Clue 1, the person who drinks tea lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Tea drinker.

2. **Third House:**
   - From Clue 5, the person who eats oranges does not live in the second house. So, they must live in the first or third house.
   - Since the first house is already taken by the tea drinker, the person who eats oranges must live in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Oranges eater.

3. **Second House:**
   - From Clue 2, the person who eats apples lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - Since the person who eats oranges is in the third house, the person who eats apples must be in the first or second house.
   - If the person who eats apples is in the first house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Minivan driver.

4. **Third House:**
   - From Clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books.
   - Since the person who drives a minivan is in the second house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Convertible driver.

5. **First and Third House:**
   - From Clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes fantasy books and the person who drinks coffee.
   - The only way this can happen is if the person who likes fantasy books is in the first house and the person who drinks coffee is in the third house, or vice versa.
   - Since the first house is already the tea drinker, the person who likes fantasy books must be in the first house, and the person who drinks coffee must be in the third house.
   - So, House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, and House 3: Coffee drinker.

### Conclusion:
The coffee drinker lives in the third house.

So, the answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person who likes a different color and reads a different kind of book. We need to figure out where the person who loves fantasy books lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The person who likes red lives right next to the person who reads mystery books.
2. The person who loves fantasy books doesn't live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white doesn't live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

Let's start with clue 4:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Red
- House 3: ?

Now, clue 1 tells us that the person who likes red lives next to the person who reads mystery books. Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who reads mystery books must be in the third house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

Clue 2 says the person who loves fantasy books doesn't live in the first house. So, the person who loves fantasy books must be in either the second or third house. But the third house is already taken by the mystery book reader, so the person who loves fantasy books must be in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Red, Fantasy
- House 3: Mystery

Clue 3 says the person who likes white doesn't live in the third house. Since the third house is taken by the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must be in the first house:
- House 1: White
- House 2: Red, Fantasy
- House 3: Mystery

Now, the only color left for the first house is white, and the only book left for the first house is romance:
- House 1: White, Romance
- House 2: Red, Fantasy
- House 3: Yellow, Mystery

So, the person who loves fantasy books lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

   - So, the second house has a rose bouquet.

2. **Clue 1 and Clue 4:** The person with the TV lives right next to the tea drinker and the guitarist.
   - Since the tea drinker can't be in the second house (Clue 3), the tea drinker must be in the third house.
   - The person with the TV must be in the second house, and the guitarist must be in the third house.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker is in the third house.
   - So, the third house has the tea drinker and the guitarist.

4. **Clue 6:** The person with the tulips lives to the right of the person with the radio.
   - The person with the radio must be in the first house, and the person with the tulips must be in the third house.

6. **Clue 2:** The person eating kiwis lives to the right of the coffee drinker.

So, the correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.**
   - So, House 3 has the fantasy book enthusiast.

2. **The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.**
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3, the history book buff must be in House 2.

3. **The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.**
   - The fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 4.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.**
   - The person eating apples can't be in House 3 (because the fantasy book enthusiast is there), so they must be in House 1 or House 2. If they are in House 2, the person in House 1 would be wearing running shoes. But House 2 is already taken by the history book buff. So, the person eating apples must be in House 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

5. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - The person wearing sandals can't be in House 1 (because the person eating apples is there) or House 2 (because the person wearing running shoes is there). So, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person eating mangos must be in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.**
   - The fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3, so the person eating a banana must be in House 4.

7. **There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.**
   - The person eating apples is in House 1, so the person wearing boots must be in House 3.

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:** Eating apples, wearing running shoes
- **House 2:** Eating mangos, wearing sandals
- **House 3:** Fantasy book enthusiast, wearing boots
- **House 4:** Science fiction book fanatic, eating a banana

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 4.

The answer is: **(B) 4**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues. Here are the clues:

2. The person who owns an SUV doesn't live in the second house.
3. The flutist lives next to the person who likes white.

Let's start with the first clue:
- The person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the first house. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.

Now, the second clue:
- The person who owns an SUV doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house.

Next, the third clue:
- The flutist lives next to the person who likes white. Since the flutist must live in the first house (because the person who likes white lives in the second house), the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Finally, the fourth clue:
- The person wearing loafers lives next to the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person wearing loafers must live in the first house.

So, we know:
- House 1: Flutist, wears loafers, owns an SUV.
- House 2: Likes white, ate fried rice.

Since the person in House 1 owns an SUV and the person in House 2 ate fried rice, the person in House 1 must have eaten spaghetti. The person in House 2 must own a sedan.

Now, we need to figure out the favorite color and the type of shoes for the person in House 1:
- The person in House 1 cannot like white (since the person in House 2 likes white). So, the person in House 1 must like green.

Since the person in House 1 wears loafers, the person in House 2 must wear sandals.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"

Since the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who had stew lives in House 2, and the person who likes red lives in House 3, the person who likes blue lives in House 4, and the person who likes green lives in House 5.

- **House 1**: White
- **House 2**: Stew, High Heels
- **House 3**: Red, Yellow
- **House 4**: Blue
- **House 5**: Green, Grilled Cheese

The person who is wearing loafers lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses:
- House 1
- House 2

Each house has one person living in it. We know a few things about these people:
1. One person has a computer, and the other has a television.
2. One person has a bouquet of lilies, and the other has a rose bouquet.

Now, let's look at the clues:
1. The person with the lilies doesn't live in House 1.
   - So, the person with the lilies must live in House 2.

2. The person with the television lives in House 1.
   - So, the person in House 1 has the television.

Since the person in House 1 has the television, the person in House 2 must have the computer.

So, the person who has the computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has a person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues. Here are the clues:

1. The person who loves science fiction books lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who ate pizza and the person who loves history books live next to each other.
3. The person who plays the guitar lives to the right of the person who has daffodils.

Let's start with the first clue:
- The person who loves science fiction books must live in house 1 because they have to be to the left of the golfer. So, the golfer must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at the second clue:
- The person who ate pizza and the person who loves history books live next to each other. Since the houses are next to each other, one of them must live in house 1 and the other in house 2.
- We already know the golfer is in house 2, so the person who loves history books must be in house 2. This means the person who ate pizza must be in house 1.

Finally, let's use the third clue:
- The person who plays the guitar lives to the right of the person who has daffodils. Since the person in house 2 is to the right of the person in house 1, the person who has daffodils must be in house 1, and the person who plays the guitar must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who loves science fiction books, has daffodils, and ate pizza.
- House 2: The golfer, the person who loves history books, and the person who plays the guitar.

Now, we need to find out who the percussionist is. Since the only person left in house 1 is the one who loves science fiction books, has daffodils, and ate pizza, the percussionist must be in house 1.

So, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is:
(A) 1

That's it! The percussionist lives in house 1."
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with a pet, a musical instrument, and a device. We need to figure out where the person who plays the percussion lives. Let's use the clues to solve it step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person with the gameboy lives to the right of the guitarist.
2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner doesn't live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast and the horse owner live next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The flutist lives directly to the left of the person with the television.

6. **Clue 6:** The guitarist lives to the right of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 7:** The person with the television lives directly to the left of the person with the gameboy.
8. **Clue 8:** The violinist lives in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between the person with the phone and the horse owner.
10. **Clue 10:** The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

Let's start with the easy clues:

- **House 4:** The violinist (Clue 8)
- **House 5:** The bird keeper (Clue 10)

Now, let's use Clue 7:
- The person with the television must be in House 3, and the person with the gameboy must be in House 4 (since the violinist is in House 4).

Next, Clue 4:
- The flutist must be in House 2 (since the person with the television is in House 3).

Now, Clue 5:
- The person with the radio must be in House 5 (since the person with the television is in House 3).

Next, Clue 1:
- The guitarist must be in House 5 (since the person with the gameboy is in House 4).

Now, Clue 6:
- The percussionist must be in House 3 (since the guitarist is in House 5).

Next, Clue 9:
- The person with the phone must be in House 1 (since there are two houses between the person with the phone and the horse owner, and the horse owner must be in House 4).

Now, Clue 3:
- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the horse owner must be in House 4.

Finally, Clue 2:
- The dog owner must be in House 1 (since the dog owner doesn't live in the second house).

So, the arrangement is:
- **House 1:** Dog owner, phone
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast, television, percussionist
- **House 4:** Horse owner, gameboy, guitarist
- **House 5:** Bird keeper, radio, violinist

The percussionist lives in House 3.

So, the answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples.
2. **Clue 2:** The person with the radio lives to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** The person with lilies lives in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The basketball player doesn't live in the first house.

Let's start with Clue 3:
- The person in the first house has lilies.
- So, the person in the second house must have roses.

Now, Clue 4:
- The basketball player doesn't live in the first house.
- So, the basketball player must live in the second house.

Next, Clue 1 and Clue 2:
- The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples.
- The person with the radio also lives to the right of the violinist.
- Since the radio person must be to the right, they must be in the second house.
- So, the person in the first house must have the computer.

Now, let's figure out the fruits:
- The person with the radio (in the second house) can't be eating apples (Clue 1).
- So, the person in the second house must be eating oranges.
- Therefore, the person in the first house must be eating apples.

Finally, let's figure out the musical instruments:
- The person with the radio (in the second house) can't be the violinist (Clue 2).
- So, the person in the second house must be the pianist.
- Therefore, the person in the first house must be the violinist.

So, the violinist lives in the first house.

The answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 5 houses, and each house has a person who plays a different sport and ate a different food for lunch. We need to figure out where the cricketer lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Let's start filling in what we know:

1. **House 3: Tennis player**
2. **House 5: Grilled cheese**
3. **House 4: Golfer**

Now, let's use clue 4:
- There is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who ate spaghetti.
- The only possible pairs are (1, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 5).
- But the tennis player is in house 3, so (1, 3) is not possible.
- The golfer is in house 4, so (2, 4) is not possible.
- Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 5.

So now we have:
- **House 1: Fried rice**
- **House 3: Tennis player**
- **House 4: Golfer**
- **House 5: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti**

Next, let's use clue 6:
- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 5, the person who had stew must be in house 4.

So now we have:
- **House 1: Fried rice**
- **House 3: Tennis player**
- **House 4: Golfer, Stew**
- **House 5: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti**

Now, let's use clue 5:
- The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
- The only house left for pizza is house 2.

So now we have:
- **House 1: Fried rice**
- **House 2: Pizza**
- **House 3: Tennis player**
- **House 4: Golfer, Stew**
- **House 5: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti**

Finally, let's use clue 7:
- The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.
- The tennis player is in house 3, so the soccer player must be in house 4 or 5.
- But the golfer is in house 4, so the soccer player must be in house 5.

So now we have:
- **House 1: Fried rice, Basketball player**
- **House 2: Pizza, Cricketer**
- **House 3: Tennis player**
- **House 4: Golfer, Stew**
- **House 5: Soccer player, Grilled cheese, Spaghetti**

The cricketer lives in house 2.

So, the answer is: **(B) 2**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and we need to figure out who lives where based on some clues. Let's write down what we know:

1. **House 1** and **House 2**.
2. Each person ate something different: one had stew, and one had spaghetti.
3. Each person has a favorite color: one likes white, and one likes red.
4. Each person has a favorite drink: one only drinks water, and one likes milk.
5. Each person plays a different sport: one is a baseball player, and one is a swimmer.
6. Each person is wearing different shoes: one is wearing running shoes, and one is wearing loafers.

Now, let's use the clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in House 2 is wearing running shoes.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - So, the person in House 1 likes white, and the person in House 2 ate spaghetti.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti is in House 2, the baseball player must be in House 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti is in House 2, the person who only drinks water must be in House 1.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:**
  - Wears loafers (because the person in House 2 wears running shoes)
  - Likes white
  - Baseball player
  - Drinks water
  - Ate stew (because the person in House 2 ate spaghetti)

- **House 2:**
  - Wears running shoes
  - Likes red (because the person in House 1 likes white)
  - Swimmer (because the person in House 1 is a baseball player)
  - Drinks milk (because the person in House 1 drinks water)
  - Ate spaghetti

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 1.

The answer is:
(B) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. Each person is eating a different fruit and drinking a different drink. We need to figure out where the root beer lover lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos.
2. The person who drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's start with the root beer lover:
- Clue 3 tells us the root beer lover can't be in the second house. So, the root beer lover must be in either the first or the third house.

Now, let's think about the person who drinks water:
- Clue 2 tells us the person who drinks water must be to the right of the root beer lover. If the root beer lover is in the first house, the person who drinks water must be in the third house. If the root beer lover is in the third house, there's no one to the right, so that can't be right.

So, the root beer lover must be in the first house, and the person who drinks water must be in the third house.

Next, let's place the coffee drinker:
- Clue 1 tells us the coffee drinker must be to the left of the person eating mangos. Since the root beer lover is in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in the second house. This means the person eating mangos must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the fruits:
- The person in the first house (root beer lover) can't be eating mangos, so they must be eating either grapes or oranges.
- The person in the third house (water drinker) is eating mangos.
- The person in the second house (coffee drinker) must be eating the remaining fruit, which is grapes.

Since the person in the first house can't be eating mangos, they must be eating oranges.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, eating oranges
- House 2: Coffee drinker, eating grapes
- House 3: Water drinker, eating mangos

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The answer is: **(B) 1**."

- The person in the first house ate spaghetti.
  - So, House 1: Spaghetti

Now, let's use the other clues:

- The person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or third house. But we already know the first house has spaghetti, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
  - So, House 3: Fried Rice

- The person wearing boots lives right next to the person who ate fried rice, on the left side. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person wearing boots must be in the second house.
  - So, House 2: Boots

- The person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house. Since the person in the second house is wearing boots, the person wearing loafers must be in the third house.
  - So, House 3: Fried Rice, Loafers

Now, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Fried Rice, Loafers

The person in the first house must be wearing running shoes because we already know the second house has boots and the third house has loafers.
- So, House 1: Spaghetti, Running Shoes

The person in the second house must have eaten pizza because we already know the first house had spaghetti and the third house had fried rice.
- So, House 2: Pizza, Boots

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the third house.

- House 2: Tulips

From Clue 12, the person with water must be in House 1.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes mystery books lives in House 1.
   - So, the person in House 1 reads mystery books.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who plays tennis does not live in House 1.
   - This means the person who plays tennis must live in House 2.

Now, let's figure out the rest:

- Since the person in House 1 reads mystery books, the person in House 2 must read fantasy books (because there are only two types of books and they are different).

- The person in House 2 plays tennis, so the person in House 1 must play golf (because there are only two sports and they are different).

So, the person who reads fantasy books lives in House 2.

The answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

1. **The cellist lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1 has the cellist.

2. **The golfer does not live in the fourth house.**
   - So, the golfer can be in House 1, 2, or 3.

3. **The violinist does not live in the fourth house.**
   - So, the violinist can be in House 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.**
   - So, the person in high heels can be in House 1, 2, or 3.

   - This means the basketball player can't be in House 4, and the person who likes red can't be in House 1.

6. **The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the flutist can't be in House 1, and the person in boots can't be in House 4.

7. **The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the flutist can't be in House 4, and the person who likes yellow can't be in House 1.

8. **The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - This means the basketball player can't be in House 1, and the person in running shoes can't be in House 4.

9. **The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
   - This means the person who likes yellow can't be in House 4, and the person who likes milk can't be in House 1.

10. **The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.**
    - This means the flutist can't be in House 1, and the cricketer can't be in House 4.

11. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
    - This means the person who likes blue can't be in House 1, and the root beer lover can't be in House 4.

12. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.**
    - This means the person who only drinks water can't be in House 4, and the coffee drinker can't be in House 1.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:** Cellist (Clue 1)
- **House 4:** Not Golfer, Not Violinist, Not High Heels, Not Flutist, Not Yellow, Not Blue, Not Water

Since the cellist is in House 1, and the person who only drinks water must be to the left of the coffee drinker (Clue 12), the person who only drinks water must be in House 1.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in House 1.

The answer is: **(A) 1**."

- **House 1**: Running shoes (Clue 13)
- **House 3**: Boots (Clue 17)
- **House 4**: Swimmer (Clue 7)

Now, let's use more clues:

- The person with loafers lives next to the person with carnations and horses (Clue 6 and Clue 9). Since the person with boots is in House 3, the person with loafers must be in House 2, and the person with carnations and horses must be in House 3.
- **House 2**: Loafers
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses

- The dog owner lives next to the person with tulips (Clue 12). Since the person with loafers is in House 2, the dog owner must be in House 1, and the person with tulips must be in House 2.
- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips

- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone, Tennis player
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Roses, Gameboy

- The person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a radio (Clue 10). Since the person with a phone is in House 1, the person with a radio must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 already has a gameboy, so the person with a radio must be in House 3.
- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone, Tennis player
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Roses, Gameboy
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses, Radio

- The fish lover lives to the left of the person with a phone (Clue 3). Since the person with a phone is in House 1, the fish lover must be in House 1.
- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone, Tennis player, Fish lover

- The cat lover lives to the left of the soccer player (Clue 11). Since the person in House 1 is the fish lover, the cat lover must be in House 1, and the soccer player must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 3 already has a radio, so the soccer player must be in House 2.
- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone, Tennis player, Fish lover, Cat lover
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Roses, Gameboy, Soccer player

- The person with lilies lives to the right of the basketball player (Clue 8). Since the person in House 1 is the tennis player and the person in House 2 is the soccer player, the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.

- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone, Tennis player, Fish lover, Cat lover
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Roses, Gameboy, Soccer player, Basketball player
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses, Radio, Lilies

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

1. **The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.**
   - So, in House 1, someone is eating kiwis.
   - In House 2, someone is eating apples (because there are only two houses and they can't both be eating kiwis).

2. **The bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the person in high heels are in House 1 and House 2, but we don't know which one is which yet.

3. **The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person in House 1 is eating kiwis, the person in House 2 must be eating apples.
   - So, the tennis player must be in House 1 (next to the person eating apples in House 2).

4. **The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.**
   - So, in House 2, someone likes science fiction books.

5. **The dog owner does not live in the first house.**
   - So, the dog owner must live in House 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:**
  - Eating kiwis
  - Tennis player
  - Bird keeper (because the bird keeper and the person in high heels are next to each other, and the dog owner is in House 2)
  - Wearing sandals (because the person in high heels is in House 2)

- **House 2:**
  - Eating apples
  - Dog owner

The only fruit left is grapes, and the only house left is House 1.

### Answer:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

### Clues:

12. The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
13. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.

### Let's Start Solving:
1. **House 1: Green**
   - The person who likes green lives in the first house.

2. **House 4: Fried Rice**
   - The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.

3. **House 3: Not Truck**
   - The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.

4. **House 1: Mangos, House 2: Pizza**
   - The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza. So, if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 1.

5. **House 2: Pizza, House 3: Blue**
   - The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue. So, if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who likes blue must be in House 3.

6. **House 3: Blue, House 4: SUV**
   - The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other. So, if the person who likes blue is in House 3, the person who owns an SUV must be in House 4.

7. **House 2: Pizza, House 3: Rose Bouquet**
   - The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. So, if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

8. **House 2: Pizza, House 3: Apples**
   - The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. So, if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who is eating apples must be in House 3.

9. **House 1: Mangos, House 2: Pizza, House 3: Blue, Rose Bouquet, Apples, House 4: Fried Rice, SUV**
   - The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red. So, if the person who is eating mangos is in House 1, the person who likes red must be in House 2.

10. **House 2: Pizza, Red, House 3: Blue, Rose Bouquet, Apples, House 4: Fried Rice, SUV**
    - The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. So, if the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3 or 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the person who is eating apples, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 4.

11. **House 1: Mangos, Green, House 2: Pizza, Red, House 3: Blue, Rose Bouquet, Apples, House 4: Fried Rice, SUV, Grapes**
    - The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. So, if the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 1.

12. **House 1: Mangos, Green, Carnations, House 2: Pizza, Red, House 3: Blue, Rose Bouquet, Apples, House 4: Fried Rice, SUV, Grapes**
    - The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 3, the person who drives a truck must be in House 1, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2.

13. **House 1: Mangos, Green, Carnations, Truck, House 2: Pizza, Red, Lilies, House 3: Blue, Rose Bouquet, Apples, House 4: Fried Rice, SUV, Grapes**
    - The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 4 (already occupied by the person who owns an SUV), the person who drives a minivan must be in House 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

### Final Arrangement:
- **House 1: Mangos, Green, Carnations, Truck, Minivan, Spaghetti**
- **House 2: Pizza, Red, Lilies**

The person who had pizza lives in **House 2**.

So, the correct answer is:
(D) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. **The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. **The baseball player lives in the second house.**
   - So, the person in the second house is the baseball player.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.**
   - So, the person in the second house drives a convertible.

Now, let's put all this together:
- The second house has someone who is eating grapes, is a baseball player, and drives a convertible.

Since the second house is all figured out, we can now figure out the first house:
- The first house must have someone who is eating mangos (because the person in the second house is eating grapes).
- The first house must have someone who is a cricketer (because the person in the second house is a baseball player).
- The first house must have someone who drives a minivan (because the person in the second house drives a convertible).

So, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is:
(B) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person who likes a different color and is eating a different fruit. We need to figure out where the person who likes white lives.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly to the left of the person who is eating oranges.

Let's start with the second clue:
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house.

Now, let's use the third clue:
- The person who likes blue (in the second house) is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
- So, the person eating kiwis must be in the third house.

Next, let's use the fourth clue:
- The person who is eating apples lives directly to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
- Since the person in the third house is eating kiwis, the person in the second house must be eating oranges.
- Therefore, the person in the first house must be eating apples.

Now, let's use the first clue:
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green.
- The person in the first house can't like white because they are on the far left.
- The person in the second house likes blue, so they can't like white.
- Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the third house.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 3.

The answer is:
(A) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes root beer lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet can't be in house 2, because there's no house to the right of house 2. So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since there are only two houses, the soccer player must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the mystery book reader is in house 2, the person with the gameboy must be in house 1.

So, let's put it all together:
- House 1: The person has a rose bouquet, is a soccer player, and has a gameboy.
- House 2: The person is a mystery book reader.

The person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with a different pet and a different car. We need to figure out where the dog owner lives. Here are the clues we have:

1. The person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. There are two houses between the person who drives a truck and the dog owner.
3. The person who drives a truck lives directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The fish enthusiast lives directly to the left of the dog owner.
5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's start with clue 3: The truck driver lives directly to the left of the sedan owner. This means they must be next to each other, with the truck driver on the left. So, the possible pairs are:
- House 1 (truck) and House 2 (sedan)
- House 2 (truck) and House 3 (sedan)
- House 3 (truck) and House 4 (sedan)

Now, let's use clue 2: There are two houses between the truck driver and the dog owner. This means the truck driver and the dog owner must be in houses 1 and 4, or 4 and 1. But since the truck driver must be to the left of the sedan owner, the only possible pair is:
- House 1 (truck) and House 4 (dog)

So, the truck driver is in House 1, and the dog owner is in House 4.

Next, let's use clue 4: The fish enthusiast lives directly to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 4, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Truck driver
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Dog owner

Using clue 1: The person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast is in House 3, the minivan driver must be in House 4. But House 4 is already taken by the dog owner, so the minivan driver must be in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Truck driver
- House 2: Minivan driver
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Dog owner

Finally, the only house left for the cat lover is House 2, but the minivan driver is already there. So, the cat lover must be in House 3, but the fish enthusiast is already there. The only remaining house for the cat lover is House 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Truck driver
- House 2: Minivan driver (cat lover)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Dog owner

The dog owner lives in House 4.

The answer is: **(A) 4**."

4. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.**
   - The only houses to the right of House 1 are House 2, House 3, and House 4. But House 2 is for root beer, and House 3 is yellow. So, the person who likes white must be in House 4.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.**
   - Since yellow is in House 3, milk must be in House 4.

So, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Water

- **House 3:**
  - The person in House 3 can't be the baseball player, the person eating oranges, the person eating grapes, the dog owner, or the person wearing sandals. So, they must be the cricketer, eating mangos, and the cat lover.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

**Clues:**
1. The person who plays the cello (the cellist) lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a dog doesn't live in the first house.

Let's break it down:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives next to the person with the gameboy.
   - This means the cellist must be in House 1, and the person with the gameboy must be in House 2. Why? Because they are next to each other, and there are only two houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner doesn't live in the first house.
   - This means the dog owner must live in House 2.

So, we know:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Dog owner and gameboy

Now, let's fill in the rest:
- The person in House 1 must have a different pet, so they have a fish.
- The person in House 1 must play a different instrument, so they play the cello.
- The person in House 2 must play the guitar (since the cellist is in House 1).

So, the final setup is:
- House 1: Cellist, Fish, Computer
- House 2: Guitarist, Dog, Gameboy

The dog owner lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person who has a different car and a different device. We need to figure out who has what and where they live based on the clues.

1. **The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.**
   - So, House 3 has a gameboy.

2. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1 has a minivan.

3. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with the SUV are next to each other, with the phone on the left.

4. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - Since the gameboy is in House 3, the radio must be in House 4.

5. **The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.**
   - So, the convertible can't be in House 3.

6. **The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.**
   - So, the computer can't be in House 1.

Now, let's put this all together:

- **House 1:** Minivan (from clue 2)
- **House 3:** Gameboy (from clue 1)
- **House 4:** Radio (from clue 4)

We know the phone and SUV must be next to each other, and the phone must be on the left. Since the gameboy is in House 3, the only place for the phone and SUV to be next to each other is in Houses 2 and 3. So:
- **House 2:** Phone
- **House 3:** SUV

Now, we need to place the convertible and the truck in the remaining houses (1 and 4):
- The convertible can't be in House 3 (from clue 5), so it must be in House 4.
- The only car left for House 1 is the truck.

Finally, we need to place the computer:
- The computer can't be in House 1 (from clue 6), so it must be in House 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- **House 1:** Minivan, Truck
- **House 2:** Phone, Computer
- **House 3:** Gameboy, SUV
- **House 4:** Radio, Convertible

The person who owns an SUV lives in House 3.

- House 3 has tulips.
- House 2 has a computer.

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:
- Clue 2 tells us that the person with a phone is next to the person with a television, and the phone is on the left. So, if the phone is in House 1, the television must be in House 2. But House 2 already has a computer, so the phone must be in House 1 and the television in House 2.
  - House 1: Phone
  - House 2: Television

- Clue 1 tells us that the person with lilies is to the right of the person with a phone. Since the phone is in House 1, the lilies must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 has a television and House 3 has tulips, so the lilies must be in House 4 or 5.
  - House 4 or 5: Lilies

- Clue 4 tells us that the person with daffodils is to the right of the person with a radio. Clue 5 says the daffodils are not in House 4, so they must be in House 5. This means the radio must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4. But House 1 has a phone, House 2 has a television, and House 3 has tulips, so the radio must be in House 4.
  - House 4: Radio
  - House 5: Daffodils

- Clue 7 tells us that the person with a rose bouquet is next to the person with carnations, and the rose bouquet is on the left. The only houses left are House 1 and House 2, but House 1 has a phone and House 2 has a television. So, the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the carnations in House 2.
  - House 1: Rose bouquet

3. **House 4:** Golfer
4. **House 5:** Not wearing running shoes

Now, let's use the clues one by one:

- **Clue 7:** The person wearing loafers lives next to the cricketer. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But we already know the bird keeper is in House 1, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **Clue 8:** There is one house between the bird keeper and the person wearing sandals. The bird keeper is in House 1, so the person wearing sandals must be in House 3 or House 5. But we just found out the person wearing loafers is in House 3, so the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **Clue 3:** The tennis player lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. The person wearing sandals is in House 5, so the tennis player must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4. But we already know the bird keeper is in House 1, the cricketer is in House 2, and the golfer is in House 4, so the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **Clue 10:** The baseball player lives to the right of the person wearing sandals. The person wearing sandals is in House 5, so the baseball player must be in House 5.

Now, the second clue:
- The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the radio must be in house 1, and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

Next, the third clue:
- The root beer lover doesn't live in the first house. So, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Finally, the fourth clue:

The answer is: **(A) 2**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person who likes different things. We need to figure out where the person who likes green lives. Let's use the clues to help us:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1 has the tea drinker.

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk can't be in House 4, and the person who ate spaghetti can't be in House 1.

   - So, the person who likes white and the person who drinks water must be in Houses 3 and 4 or Houses 2 and 3.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - So, the person who likes green must be in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**

- **House 1:** Tea drinker
- **House 2:** Pizza eater
- **House 3:** ?
- **House 4:** ?

From Clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who drinks water must be next to each other. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the pizza eater is in House 2, the person who likes white and the person who drinks water must be in Houses 3 and 4.

From Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who drinks water. Since the person who drinks water is in House 3 or 4, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3.

From Clue 2, the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow can't be in House 1 or 2, they must be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in House 1. Since the person who likes green can't be in House 1, and the person who likes yellow is in House 4, the person who likes green must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in House 1. Since the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in House 1, and the person who ate spaghetti is in House 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- **House 1:** Tea drinker, red (since the only color left is red)

- **House 3:** Spaghetti eater, coffee, green
- **House 4:** Grilled cheese eater, water, white

   So, the person who likes milk must be in House 1, and the sedan owner must be in House 4.

9. **The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - If the person who drives a minivan is in House 1, the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - If the person who drives a minivan is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3 (but House 3 already has a dog and likes white).
   - If the person who drives a minivan is in House 3, the person wearing sandals must be in House 4 (but House 4 already has horses and drinks water).

   So, the person who drives a minivan must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

10. **The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.**
    - So, the person in House 2 must be wearing loafers.

11. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.**
    - The root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

12. **The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.**
    - The person in House 1 must be wearing high heels.

13. **The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.**
    - The person in House 2 is wearing loafers, and the person in House 4 owns an SUV.

So, the person who likes red lives in House 2.

The answer is:
(C) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out where the person with the lilies lives. Let's use the clues to help us:

1. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
5. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
6. There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
7. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
8. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
9. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
10. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
11. The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
12. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
13. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
14. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
15. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
16. The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer.
17. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.
18. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.

Let's start with the easy clues:

- **House 3**: The person wearing running shoes lives here.
- **House 4**: The baseball player lives here, and they are wearing loafers.

Now, let's use Clue 16:
- The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer. Since House 4 is the baseball player, the swimmer and golfer must be in Houses 2 and 3. But House 3 already has running shoes, so the swimmer must be in House 2 and the golfer in House 3.

- **House 2**: Swimmer
- **House 3**: Golfer, Running shoes

Next, Clue 17:
- The person with lilies lives directly left of the person eating grapes. Since the swimmer is in House 2, the person with lilies must be in House 1 and the person eating grapes in House 2.

- **House 1**: Lilies
- **House 2**: Swimmer, Grapes

Now, Clue 12:
- There is one house between the person with daffodils and the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the person with daffodils must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has lilies, so the person with daffodils must be in House 3.

- **House 3**: Golfer, Running shoes, Daffodils

Clue 18:
- The person with daffodils is to the left of the person eating kiwis. Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person eating kiwis must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is the baseball player, so the person eating kiwis must be in House 5.

- **House 5**: Kiwis

Clue 7:
- The water drinker and the person eating kiwis are separated by one house. Since the person eating kiwis is in House 5, the water drinker must be in House 4.

- **House 4**: Baseball player, Loafers, Water

Clue 5:
- The water drinker is to the right of the milk drinker. Since the water drinker is in House 4, the milk drinker must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 has lilies and House 2 has grapes, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

- **House 3**: Golfer, Running shoes, Daffodils, Milk

Clue 1:
- The swimmer is to the left of the milk drinker. This is already true since the swimmer is in House 2 and the milk drinker is in House 3.

Clue 8:
- The coffee drinker is directly left of the person with sandals. Since the swimmer is in House 2, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 and the person with sandals in House 2.

- **House 1**: Lilies, Coffee drinker
- **House 2**: Swimmer, Grapes, Sandals

Clue 10:
- The person with carnations and the cricketer are in consecutive houses. Since House 4 is the baseball player and House 5 is the person eating kiwis, the person with carnations must be in House 1 and the cricketer in House 2.

- **House 1**: Lilies, Coffee drinker, Carnations
- **House 2**: Swimmer, Grapes, Sandals, Cricketer

Clue 14:
- The person with tulips is to the right of the tea drinker. Since the person with carnations is in House 1, the tea drinker must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 has lilies and carnations, and House 2 has grapes and sandals, so the tea drinker must be in House 3.

- **House 3**: Golfer, Running shoes, Daffodils, Milk, Tea drinker

Clue 14:
- The person with tulips must be in House 5.

- **House 5**: Kiwis, Tulips

So, the person with lilies lives in **House 1**.

The answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person who plays a different sport, eats a different lunch, and has different flowers. We need to figure out who ate grilled cheese and in which house they live.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The golfer lives next to the left of the basketball player.
2. The person with lilies lives next to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person with tulips doesn't live in the third house.

Let's start with the third clue:
- The soccer player lives in the third house.

Now, let's use the first clue:
- The golfer lives next to the left of the basketball player. This means the golfer must be in house 1 and the basketball player in house 2, or the golfer in house 2 and the basketball player in house 3. But since the soccer player is in house 3, the golfer must be in house 1 and the basketball player in house 2.

Next, let's use the second clue:
- The person with lilies lives next to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person with lilies must be in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese in house 2, or the person with lilies in house 2 and the person who ate grilled cheese in house 3. But since the soccer player is in house 3, the person with lilies must be in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese in house 2.

Now, let's use the fourth clue:
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

Finally, let's use the fifth clue:
- The person with tulips doesn't live in the third house. Since the soccer player is in house 3, the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2. But since the person with lilies is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Golfer, lilies, pizza (since grilled cheese and spaghetti are already assigned)
- House 2: Basketball player, grilled cheese, tulips
- House 3: Soccer player, spaghetti, daffodils

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

The answer is: **(B) 2**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 5 houses, and each house has a person who likes different foods, colors, and plays different instruments. We need to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

Here are the clues we have:

1. The saxophonist doesn't live in the fifth house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
3. The pianist lives in the third house.
4. The person who had stew lives right next to the person who likes yellow.
5. The person who likes green doesn't live in the fourth house.
6. The pianist lives to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. There are two houses between the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white.
9. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
10. The percussionist and the cellist live next to each other.
11. The percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.
12. The person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who likes yellow.

Let's start filling in what we know:

- **House 4**: The person who ate spaghetti.
- **House 3**: The pianist, and the person who likes red, and the person who ate fried rice (from clue 9).

So, we know:
- **House 3**: Pianist, Fried Rice, Red

Now, let's use the other clues:

- **Clue 1**: The saxophonist doesn't live in the fifth house.
- **Clue 6**: The pianist (House 3) is to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist must be in House 1 or 2.
- **Clue 10**: The percussionist and the cellist live next to each other, and the percussionist is to the left of the cellist. So, the percussionist must be in House 1 and the cellist in House 2.

So, we have:
- **House 1**: Percussionist
- **House 2**: Cellist

- **Clue 4**: The person who had stew lives right next to the person who likes yellow. Since the cellist is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in House 2.

So, we have:
- **House 1**: Percussionist, Stew
- **House 2**: Cellist, Yellow

- **Clue 8**: There are two houses between the person who likes yellow (House 2) and the person who likes white. So, the person who likes white must be in House 5.

So, we have:
- **House 5**: White

- **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who likes yellow (House 2). So, the person who had pizza must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 already has the person who ate spaghetti, the person who had pizza must be in House 5.

So, we have:
- **House 5**: White, Pizza

- **Clue 5**: The person who likes green doesn't live in the fourth house. Since the only house left for the person who likes green is House 1, the person who likes green must be in House 1.

So, we have:
- **House 1**: Percussionist, Stew, Green

Now, we have all the information:
- **House 1**: Percussionist, Stew, Green
- **House 2**: Cellist, Yellow
- **House 3**: Pianist, Fried Rice, Red
- **House 4**: Spaghetti
- **House 5**: White, Pizza

The person who ate fried rice lives in **House 3**.

So, the answer is:
(D) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with different things:
- Shoes: running shoes, high heels, boots, and sandals
- Lunch: stew, grilled cheese, spaghetti, and fried rice
- Drink: tea, milk, water, and root beer

We also have some clues to help us figure out who lives where. Let's use these clues one by one:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - So, House 3 has the tea drinker.

2. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who had stew is in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the person wearing sandals is in a house with a lower number than the root beer lover.

4. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in a house with a lower number than the person who drinks water.

5. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means the person wearing running shoes is in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. **The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the person wearing high heels and the person who drinks water are in houses that are next to each other.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - So, the person who ate grilled cheese is not in House 1.

Now, let's put this all together:

- **House 3: Tea drinker**
  - We know this from Clue 1.

- **Stew < Spaghetti**
  - Stew can be in House 1, 2, or 3.
  - If Stew is in House 3, Spaghetti must be in House 4.
  - If Stew is in House 2, Spaghetti can be in House 3 or 4.
  - If Stew is in House 1, Spaghetti can be in House 2, 3, or 4.

- **Sandals < Root beer**
  - Sandals can be in House 1, 2, or 3.
  - If Sandals is in House 1, Root beer can be in House 2, 3, or 4.
  - If Sandals is in House 2, Root beer can be in House 3 or 4.
  - If Sandals is in House 3, Root beer must be in House 4.

- **Grilled cheese < Water**
  - Grilled cheese can be in House 2, 3, or 4.
  - If Grilled cheese is in House 2, Water can be in House 3 or 4.
  - If Grilled cheese is in House 3, Water must be in House 4.

- **Running shoes < Stew**
  - Running shoes can be in House 1, 2, or 3.
  - If Running shoes is in House 1, Stew can be in House 2 or 3.
  - If Running shoes is in House 2, Stew can be in House 3.
  - If Running shoes is in House 3, Stew must be in House 4 (but this is not possible since House 3 is the tea drinker).

- **High heels and Water are adjacent**
  - High heels and Water must be in adjacent houses.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **Grilled cheese ≠ House 1**
  - Grilled cheese cannot be in House 1.

Let's try to place the people step by step:

1. **House 3: Tea drinker**
2. **Stew < Spaghetti** and **Running shoes < Stew**:
   - Stew cannot be in House 3 (tea drinker).
   - Stew can be in House 1 or 2.
   - If Stew is in House 1, Running shoes must be in House 1 (not possible).
   - If Stew is in House 2, Running shoes must be in House 1.

3. **Running shoes in House 1, Stew in House 2**:
   - Spaghetti must be in House 3 or 4.
   - If Spaghetti is in House 3, it conflicts with the tea drinker.
   - Therefore, Spaghetti must be in House 4.

4. **Sandals < Root beer**:
   - Sandals cannot be in House 4.
   - Sandals can be in House 1 or 2.
   - If Sandals is in House 1, Root beer must be in House 2 or 3.
   - If Sandals is in House 2, Root beer must be in House 3 or 4.
   - Since House 3 is the tea drinker, Sandals must be in House 1, and Root beer must be in House 2.

5. **Grilled cheese < Water**:
   - Grilled cheese cannot be in House 1.
   - Grilled cheese can be in House 2 or 3.
   - If Grilled cheese is in House 2, Water must be in House 3 or 4.
   - If Grilled cheese is in House 3, Water must be in House 4.
   - Since House 3 is the tea drinker, Grilled cheese must be in House 2, and Water must be in House 3.

6. **High heels and Water are adjacent**:
   - Water is in House 3.
   - High heels must be in House 2 or 4.
   - Since House 2 is the root beer lover, High heels must be in House 4.

### Final Arrangement:
- **House 1: Running shoes, Sandals**
- **House 2: Stew, Root beer, Grilled cheese**
- **House 3: Tea drinker, Water**
- **House 4: Spaghetti, High heels**

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in **House 1**.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have two houses, House 1 and House 2. Each house has one person living in it. We know a few things about these people:
- One person ate pizza for lunch, and the other ate fried rice.
- One person loves science fiction books, and the other loves history books.

We also have a clue:
- The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who loves science fiction books.

Now, let's figure it out:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in House 1 plays the piano.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the person with horses can't be in House 2 because there's no house to the right of it. So, the person with horses must be in House 1, and the root beer lover must be in House 2.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - So, the person who likes white must be in House 1.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Pianist, owns horses, likes white.
- House 2: Root beer lover.

Since the person in House 1 owns horses, the person in House 2 must own the dog. The person in House 1 likes white, so the person in House 2 must like blue.

- If the person who had fried rice is in House 4, then the person who loves fantasy books must be in House 1.
- But House 4 already has the person who had pizza, so the person who had fried rice must be in House 1, and the person who loves fantasy books must be in House 4.

So, we know:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 4: Pizza, Fantasy Books

- The person who plays the violin can't be in House 4 (because the person who loves fantasy books is there).
- The person who plays the violin can't be in House 1 (because the person who had fried rice is there).
- So, the person who plays the violin must be in House 2 or House 3.
- The person who plays the guitar must be in House 1 or House 2.

Since the person who had stew is in House 2, the person who plays the guitar must be in House 1, and the person who plays the violin must be in House 2.

So, we know:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Guitar, Science Fiction Books
- House 2: Stew, Violin
- House 3: Drums
- House 4: Pizza, Fantasy Books

Finally, let's use Clue 6:
- The person who loves history books lives to the right of the person who plays the drums.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person who likes different fruits and drinks. We need to figure out where the person who likes milk lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The person who drinks coffee lives next to the person who likes milk.
2. The person who eats mangos lives next to the person who eats apples.
3. The person who drinks coffee doesn't live in the second house.
4. The person who eats apples lives in the third house.

Let's start with the last clue:
- The person who eats apples lives in the third house.

Now, using the second clue:
- The person who eats mangos must live in the second house because they have to be next to the person who eats apples.

So, we have:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: Apples

Next, we know the person who drinks coffee doesn't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. And since the person who drinks coffee lives next to the person who likes milk, the person who likes milk must live in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Oranges, Coffee
- House 2: Mangos, Milk
- House 3: Apples

The only drink left is root beer, so the person in the third house must like root beer.

So, the person who likes milk lives in the second house.

The answer is:
(A) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who loves science fiction books lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 has the science fiction book lover.

2. **Clue 2:** The person wearing loafers and the person who likes red live next to each other.
   - This means they are in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives right next to the person with tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white is in house 1 or 2, and the person with tulips is in house 2 or 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person with carnations lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 has the carnations.

5. **Clue 5:** The person wearing boots doesn't live in the third house.
   - So, the person wearing boots is in house 1 or 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who loves history books lives to the right of the person with tulips.
   - This means the person with tulips is in house 1 or 2, and the history book lover is in house 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person with tulips lives to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person with tulips is in house 1 or 2, and the person who likes red is in house 2 or 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:** Has carnations.
- **House 2:** Has the science fiction book lover and tulips.
- **House 3:** Not the person wearing boots.

From Clue 3, the person who likes white must be in house 1 (since house 1 has carnations and is next to house 2 with tulips).

- **House 1:** Carnations, likes white.
- **House 2:** Science fiction book lover, tulips.
- **House 3:** Not the person wearing boots.

From Clue 2, the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be next to each other. Since house 2 has tulips, the person who likes red must be in house 3, and the person wearing loafers must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Carnations, likes white.
- **House 2:** Science fiction book lover, tulips, wearing loafers.
- **House 3:** Likes red.

From Clue 5, the person wearing boots must be in house 1 (since they can't be in house 3).

- **House 1:** Carnations, likes white, wearing boots.
- **House 2:** Science fiction book lover, tulips, wearing loafers.
- **House 3:** Likes red.

From Clue 6, the history book lover must be in house 3 (since the person with tulips is in house 2).

- **House 1:** Carnations, likes white, wearing boots.
- **House 2:** Science fiction book lover, tulips, wearing loafers.
- **House 3:** Likes red, history book lover.

The only person left is the fantasy book lover, who must be in house 1.

- **House 1:** Carnations, likes white, wearing boots, fantasy book lover.
- **House 2:** Science fiction book lover, tulips, wearing loafers.
- **House 3:** Likes red, history book lover.

So, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 1.

The answer is: **(B) 1**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person with different flowers and drinks. Let's use the clues to figure out who lives where.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person with lilies lives to the right of the person with tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person with lilies lives in the second house.

Let's start with Clue 2:
- The person who only drinks water lives in House 1.

Now, using Clue 1:
- There is one house between the person who drinks water (House 1) and the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk must live in House 3.

Next, Clue 4 tells us:
- The person with lilies lives in House 2.

Now, Clue 3:
- The person with lilies (House 2) lives to the right of the person with tulips. So, the person with tulips must live in House 1.

So far, we have:
- House 1: Tulips, drinks water
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Likes milk

The only flower left is the rose bouquet. Since the person in House 3 likes milk, they must have the rose bouquet.

So, the person with the rose bouquet lives in House 3.

The answer is:
(B) 3"

   - Since the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person with the gameboy must be in House 2.
   - The person with the phone does not live in the second house, so the person with the phone must be in House 1 or House 4.

   - So, House 2: Gameboy, Phone.

3. **House 1:**
   - The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

4. **House 4:**
   - The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - The person who likes green cannot be in House 4 (no one to the right), so the person who likes green must be in House 2 or House 3.
   - The person who likes green cannot be in House 3 (the person who likes yellow is there), so the person who likes green must be in House 2.
   - The person who likes blue must be in House 4.
   - So, House 4: Blue.

So, the correct answer is **(B) 1**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person with different likes and what they ate for lunch. We need to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes history books.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who loves romance books lives right next to the left of the person who loves history books.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who had pizza doesn't live in the first house.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who loves romance books.

Let's start with Clue 4:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- The person who loves romance books lives next to the left of the person who loves history books. Since the first house is taken by the person who likes yellow, the person who loves romance books must be in the second house, and the person who loves history books must be in the third house.

So far, we have:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Romance books
- House 3: History books

Next, let's use Clue 1:
- The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes history books. Since the history book lover is in the third house, the person who likes green must be in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Green (Romance books)
- House 3: History books

Next, let's use Clue 3:
- The person who had pizza doesn't live in the first house. So, the person who had pizza must be in the second or third house. Since the second house is taken by the person who likes green and loves romance books, the person who had pizza must be in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Green (Romance books)
- House 3: History books (Pizza)

Finally, let's use Clue 5:
- The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who loves romance books. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house. But the third house is already taken by the history book lover who had pizza. So, the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the first house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow (Grilled cheese)
- House 2: Green (Romance books, Fried rice)
- House 3: History books (Pizza)

The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

So, the answer is:
(A) 1"

### Putting It All Together:

- **House 1:**
  - The person with the rose bouquet must be here (Clue 4).
  - The golfer can't be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 3.
  - The tennis player must be in house 1 (since they are to the left of the person with the television, and house 1 is the only left house).

- **House 2:**
  - The person with the television must be here (Clue 1 and Clue 5).

12. **There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.**
    - Sandals, Cellist (Two houses between Sandals and Cellist)

Now, let's put the pieces together:

- House 3: Swimmer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Daffodils

From clue 4, the person wearing running shoes is directly left of the person with daffodils:
- House 4: Running shoes
- House 5: Daffodils

From clue 10, the baseball player and basketball player are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in house 4, the baseball player and basketball player must be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3. But the violinist is in house 2, so they must be in houses 1 and 2:
- House 1: Baseball player
- House 2: Basketball player

From clue 6, the basketball player is directly left of the guitarist:
- House 2: Basketball player
- House 3: Guitarist

From clue 12, there are two houses between the person wearing sandals and the cellist. Since the guitarist is in house 3, the cellist cannot be in house 1 or 5. So, the cellist must be in house 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in house 3:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 3: Sandals

From clue 3, the person wearing sandals is directly left of the person with tulips:
- House 3: Sandals

Here are the clues:
1. The person wearing high heels lives next to the fish lover.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

Let's start with the second clue:
- The person in House 2 ate grilled cheese.

Now, since the person in House 2 ate grilled cheese, the person in House 1 must have eaten something else. The only other option is stew.

So, the person in House 1 ate stew.

Now, let's use the first clue:
- The person wearing high heels lives next to the fish lover.

Since the person in House 1 is next to the person in House 2, and the person in House 1 is wearing high heels, the person in House 2 must be the fish lover.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person wearing high heels, ate stew
- House 2: Fish lover, ate grilled cheese

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person who likes different things. We need to figure out where the person who is eating apples lives. Let's use the clues to help us:

1. **Root beer and milk are next to each other.**
   - This means if one person drinks root beer, the person next to them drinks milk.

2. **The person who had pizza lives next to the tea drinker.**
   - So, if someone had pizza, the person next to them drinks tea.

3. **There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater.**
   - This means if someone drinks root beer, the person who ate grilled cheese is two houses away.

4. **There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover.**
   - So, if someone likes red, the person who likes yellow is one house away.

5. **There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater.**
   - So, if someone is eating mangos, the person eating oranges is one house away.

6. **The person who had pizza lives next to the yellow lover.**
   - So, if someone had pizza, the person next to them likes yellow.

7. **The orange eater lives next to the apple eater.**
   - So, if someone is eating oranges, the person next to them is eating apples.

8. **The stew eater doesn't live in the third house.**
   - So, the stew eater can only be in the first, second, or fourth house.

9. **The stew eater lives next to the water drinker.**
   - So, if someone had stew, the person next to them drinks water.

10. **The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater.**
    - So, if someone had stew, the person who likes white lives in a house to the right of them.

11. **The apple eater lives to the right of the pizza eater.**
    - So, if someone had pizza, the person eating apples lives in a house to the right of them.

Now, let's put this all together:

- **House 1:**
  - If the root beer lover is here, the milk drinker must be in House 2.
  - The stew eater can't be here because they can't be in the third house, and they need to be next to the water drinker.

- **House 2:**
  - If the pizza eater is here, the tea drinker must be in House 3.
  - The orange eater must be here because the orange eater is next to the apple eater.

- **House 3:**
  - The tea drinker is here because the pizza eater is in House 2.
  - The yellow lover is here because the pizza eater is next to the yellow lover.
  - The apple eater must be here because the orange eater is in House 2.

- **House 4:**
  - The grilled cheese eater is here because they are two houses away from the root beer lover.
  - The white lover is here because they are to the right of the stew eater.
  - The milk drinker is here because they are next to the root beer lover.

So, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 3**.

### Let's Start Solving:
1. **House 1 (Convertible)**:
   - The person in House 1 has a convertible.
   - From Clue 9, the person in House 1 is to the left of the person in boots. So, the person in House 1 can't be wearing boots.

2. **House 2 (SUV and History)**:
   - From Clue 6, the person with an SUV lives right next to the history book buff, on the left. So, the person in House 2 must be the history book buff.
   - The person in House 1 can't be the history book buff, so they can't have an SUV.

3. **House 3 (Truck and Mystery)**:
   - From Clue 2, the person with a truck lives right next to the mystery book reader, on the left. So, the person in House 3 must be the mystery book reader.
   - The person in House 2 can't be the mystery book reader, so they can't have a truck.

4. **House 4 (Fantasy and Fried Rice)**:
   - From Clue 8, the fantasy book fan lives right next to the person who had fried rice, on the left. So, the person in House 4 must have had fried rice.

   - From Clue 7, the person in House 1 has a convertible, so they can't be the history book buff. So, the person in House 2 must be the history book buff.
   - The person in House 2 (history book buff) can't have had grilled cheese, so the person in House 3 or House 4 must have had grilled cheese.
   - The person in House 3 (mystery book reader) can't have had grilled cheese, so the person in House 4 must have had grilled cheese.
   - The person in House 3 (mystery book reader) must have had stew, and the person in House 4 (fantasy book fan) must have had fried rice.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 5 houses, and each house has a person who likes a different kind of book and plays a different musical instrument. We need to figure out where the violinist lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The person who loves romance books lives to the left of the person who loves fantasy books.
2. There is one house between the person who loves history books and the guitarist.
3. There is one house between the percussionist and the person who loves mystery books.
4. The percussionist lives right next to the left of the person who loves romance books.
5. The person who loves mystery books lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

Let's start with the clues that tell us exactly where someone lives:
- Clue 5: The person who loves mystery books lives in the fourth house.
- Clue 7: The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

So, the person in the fourth house loves mystery books and plays the saxophone.

Next, let's use Clue 6:
- The saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in either the third or fifth house.

Now, let's use Clue 4:
- The percussionist lives right next to the left of the person who loves romance books. This means the percussionist and the romance book lover are next to each other, with the percussionist on the left.

We also know from Clue 3:
- There is one house between the percussionist and the person who loves mystery books. Since the mystery book lover is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the second house (one house to the left of the third house, which is next to the fourth house).

So, the percussionist is in the second house. This means the romance book lover must be in the third house.

Now, let's use Clue 1:
- The person who loves romance books lives to the left of the person who loves fantasy books. Since the romance book lover is in the third house, the fantasy book lover must be in the fifth house.

Finally, let's use Clue 2:
- There is one house between the person who loves history books and the guitarist. The only houses left are the first and fifth houses. Since the fantasy book lover is in the fifth house, the history book lover must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

So, the violinist must be in the third house because the saxophonist is in the fourth house, and they live next to each other.

The correct answer is:
(C) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.**
   - So, House 4 has a television.

2. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.**
   - So, House 2 has loafers.

3. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - So, the phone is not in House 2.

4. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.**
   - Since House 2 has loafers, the boots must be in House 1.

5. **There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.**
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. The only pairs that work are (1, 3) and (2, 4).

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:** Boots
- **House 2:** Loafers, not the phone
- **House 3:** ?
- **House 4:** Television

Since House 1 has boots, the person with sandals must be in House 3 (because they need to be two houses apart from the radio).

- **House 1:** Boots, Sandals
- **House 2:** Loafers, not the phone
- **House 3:** Sandals, Radio
- **House 4:** Television

Now, we need to place the phone and the gameboy:
- The phone can't be in House 2, so it must be in House 1.
- The only device left is the gameboy, which must be in House 2.

So, the person with the gameboy lives in House 2.

The answer is:
(A) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and wear. Here are the clues we have:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out where the person wearing high heels lives:

- Clue 1 tells us that the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
- We don't need to use the other clues to answer this part of the question.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. **Clue 1**: The person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who likes mystery books doesn't live in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes mystery books must live in the first house.

So, let's put it all together:
- The person in the first house likes mystery books.
- The person in the second house wears loafers.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out where the person who had pizza lives. Let's use the clues to help us:

1. **Running shoes and Gameboy are next to each other.**
2. **The person who had pizza lives next to the person with sandals.**
3. **The person with running shoes doesn't live in the third house.**
4. **The person with tulips lives next to the person who had pizza.**
5. **The person with carnations lives to the left of the person with sandals.**
6. **The person with running shoes lives next to the person who had stew.**

8. **The person with running shoes lives next to the person with a rose bouquet.**
9. **The person with boots lives to the left of the person who had pizza.**
10. **The person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person with a radio.**

Let's start with the clues that tell us about the positions:

- **Clue 2:** Pizza is next to sandals.
- **Clue 4:** Tulips are next to pizza.
- **Clue 6:** Running shoes are next to stew.
- **Clue 8:** Running shoes are next to a rose bouquet.

From Clue 2, we know:
- Pizza can't be in house 4 (because there's no house to the right of it).
- Sandals can't be in house 1 (because there's no house to the left of it).

From Clue 4, we know:
- Tulips can't be in house 4 (because there's no house to the right of it).
- Pizza can't be in house 1 (because there's no house to the left of it).

So, pizza must be in house 2 or 3.

From Clue 6, we know:
- Running shoes can't be in house 4 (because there's no house to the right of it).
- Stew can't be in house 1 (because there's no house to the left of it).

From Clue 8, we know:
- Running shoes can't be in house 4 (because there's no house to the right of it).
- Rose bouquet can't be in house 1 (because there's no house to the left of it).

From Clue 3, we know:
- Running shoes can't be in house 3.

So, running shoes must be in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- If running shoes are in house 1, then:
  - Stew is in house 2.
  - Rose bouquet is in house 2.
  - Tulips are in house 1 (because they can't be in house 4).
  - Pizza is in house 2 (because it's next to tulips).
  - Sandals are in house 3 (because they're next to pizza).

This fits all the clues:
- Running shoes (house 1) and gameboy (house 2) are next to each other.
- Pizza (house 2) is next to sandals (house 3).
- Tulips (house 1) are next to pizza (house 2).
- Running shoes (house 1) are next to stew (house 2).
- Running shoes (house 1) are next to rose bouquet (house 2).

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is:
(C) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has a person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet is in House 1, and the person with the lilies is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist doesn't live in the first house.
   - So, the saxophonist must be in House 2, and the pianist must be in House 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in House 1 is eating mangos, and the person in House 2 is eating apples.

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:**
  - Has a rose bouquet
  - Is a pianist
  - Is eating mangos

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means if the person who likes green is in House 1, the person with the phone is in House 2. If the person who likes green is in House 2, the person with the phone is in House 3, and so on.

2. **The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.**
   - This means the person who drives a convertible can't be in House 5, because there's no house to the right of it.

3. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house.**
   - So, the person who only drinks water can be in House 1, 2, 4, or 5.

4. **The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.**
   - This means if the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white is in House 2, and so on.

5. **The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.**
   - This is a big clue! We know the coffee drinker is in House 4.

    - This means if the basketball player is in House 1, the person who likes red is in House 2, and so on.

15. **The person who has a radio lives in the first house.**
    - So, the person with the radio is in House 1.

16. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.**
    - We already know the coffee drinker is in House 4, so the person with the television must be in House 5.

17. **The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.**
    - This means if the swimmer is in House 1, the person who only drinks water is in House 2, and so on.

Now, let's put it all together:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. Each person has different flowers and a different car. We need to figure out who has what and where they live.

### Clues:
1. The person with tulips doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person with the SUV lives right next to the person with lilies, but to the left.
3. The person with the sedan and the person with the rose bouquet are neighbors.
4. The person with the rose bouquet doesn't live in the second house.

### Let's break it down:

1. **Tulips not in the third house:**
   - So, tulips can only be in house 1 or house 2.

2. **SUV and lilies:**
   - The SUV is to the left of the lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.

3. **Sedan and rose bouquet:**
   - They are next to each other.
   - So, if the sedan is in house 1, the rose bouquet is in house 2.
   - If the sedan is in house 2, the rose bouquet is in house 3.

4. **Rose bouquet not in the second house:**
   - So, the rose bouquet can only be in house 1 or house 3.

### Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:**
  - If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the sedan must be in house 2 (because they are neighbors).
  - But if the sedan is in house 2, the SUV must be in house 1 (because the SUV is to the left of the lilies).
  - This means the lilies are in house 2, but we already have the sedan in house 2. This doesn't work.

- **House 3:**
  - If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the sedan must be in house 2 (because they are neighbors).
  - If the sedan is in house 2, the SUV must be in house 1 (because the SUV is to the left of the lilies).
  - This means the lilies are in house 3, and the rose bouquet is also in house 3. This works!

So, we have:
- **House 1:** SUV, tulips
- **House 2:** Sedan, tulips (but we already know tulips can't be in house 2, so this must be the sedan and something else)
- **House 3:** Lilies, rose bouquet

Since the rose bouquet is in house 3, the only car left for house 3 is the truck.

### Answer:
The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

So, the answer is:
(C) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and have. We need to figure out where the person who likes milk lives. Let's go through the clues one by one and see what we can find out.

So, we know:
- House 5: Tulips
- House 4: Lilies

Next, let's use **Clue 8**: The violinist lives directly left of the person who drinks water. This means the violinist and the water drinker are next to each other, with the violinist on the left.

- **Clue 3**: The violinist does not live in the fourth house. So, the violinist and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

Now, let's use **Clue 1**: The violinist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fifth house. Also, **Clue 11** says the science fiction book fanatic is not in the second house. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic

Since the violinist is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, the violinist must be in the second house, and the water drinker must be in the third house.

- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Water Drinker

Now, let's use **Clue 12**: The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live next to each other. They can't be in the first or fifth house because those are already taken. They must be in the third and fourth houses or the fourth and fifth houses. But the fourth house has lilies, so they must be in the third and fourth houses.

- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Root Beer Lover, Lilies

Now, let's use **Clue 15**: The pianist and the mystery book reader live next to each other. They can't be in the first or fifth house because those are already taken. They must be in the fourth and fifth houses. Since the fourth house has the root beer lover, the pianist must be in the fourth house, and the mystery book reader must be in the fifth house.

- House 4: Pianist, Root Beer Lover, Lilies
- House 5: Mystery Book Reader, Tulips

Now, let's use **Clue 6**: The person with carnations lives directly left of the pianist. So, the person with carnations must be in the third house.

- House 3: Carnations, Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now, let's use **Clue 4**: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live next to each other. They can't be in the first or fifth house because those are already taken. They must be in the second and third houses or the third and fourth houses. But the third house already has carnations, so they must be in the second and third houses.

- House 2: Rose Bouquet, Violinist
- House 3: Milk, Carnations, Fantasy Book Enthusiast

So, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The answer is: (B) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

1. **The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1: Likes yellow.

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1: Likes yellow, Eats kiwis.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.**
   - So, House 4: Drives a convertible.

4. **The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other.**
   - Since the person who drives a convertible is in House 4, the person who is eating a banana must be in House 3, and the person who owns an SUV must be in House 2.
   - So, House 3: Eats banana.
   - So, House 2: Owns an SUV.

5. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white.**
   - So, House 3: Eats banana.
   - So, House 4: Likes white, Drives a convertible.

6. **The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white.**
   - So, House 3: Eats banana, Drives a minivan.
   - So, House 4: Likes white, Drives a convertible.

7. **The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live next to each other.**
   - So, House 2: Owns an SUV, Likes blue.

8. **The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.**
   - So, the cricketer must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

9. **There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives.**
   - If the cricketer is in House 1, the swimmer must be in House 3.
   - If the cricketer is in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 4.
   - If the cricketer is in House 3, the swimmer must be in House 1.

10. **The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.**
    - So, the soccer player must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.**
    - So, the swimmer must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1**: Likes yellow, Eats kiwis, Drives a truck (since SUV and minivan are taken), Plays soccer (since cricketer and swimmer are not in House 1).
- **House 2**: Likes blue, Owns an SUV, Plays cricketer (since swimmer and soccer player are not in House 2).
- **House 3**: Likes green (since yellow, white, and blue are taken), Eats banana, Drives a minivan, Plays swimmer (since cricketer and soccer player are not in House 3).
- **House 4**: Likes white, Eats oranges (since kiwis, banana, and mango are taken), Drives a convertible, Plays basketball (since cricketer, swimmer, and soccer player are not in House 4).

So, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The answer is:
(A) 4"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person who likes different things. We need to figure out who likes what and where they live.

1. **The person who likes green lives in the third house.**
   - So, House 3: Green

2. **The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live next to each other.**
   - Since the person who likes green is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2.
   - So, House 2: Yellow
   - House 3: Green

3. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the right of the person who had stew.**
   - This means the person who had stew can't be in House 3 (because there's no house to the right of it). So, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the person who had stew is in House 2, the fantasy book enthusiast would have to be in House 3. But that would mean the person in House 2 (who likes yellow) had stew, and the person in House 3 (who likes green) is the fantasy book enthusiast. This doesn't work because of the next clue.
   - So, the person who had stew must be in House 1.
   - House 1: Stew

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.**
   - Since the person who had stew is in House 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Grilled Cheese

5. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.**
   - Since the person who had stew is in House 1, the romance book lover must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Romance

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Stew, (not green, not yellow, so must be blue)
- House 2: Yellow, Romance
- House 3: Green, Grilled Cheese

So, the person who likes blue lives in House 1.

8. The cellist doesn't live in the third house.

### Let's Start:
1. **First House:**
   - Clue 7 tells us the person with carnations lives here.
   - So, House 1 has carnations.

2. **Third House:**
   - Clue 4 tells us the person who likes yellow lives here.
   - So, House 3 has yellow.

3. **Second House:**
   - Clue 6 tells us the person who likes blue is next to the person with horses.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes blue must be in House 2.
   - So, House 2 has blue.

4. **Bird Keeper:**
   - Clue 1 tells us the person with tulips and the bird keeper are next to each other.
   - Since House 1 has carnations, the person with tulips must be in House 2, and the bird keeper must be in House 3.

9. **Cellist:**
   - Clue 8 tells us the cellist doesn't live in the third house.
   - Since the percussionist is in House 1, the cellist must be in House 2.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who loves fantasy books lives in the first house.
2. The person who plays the cello lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

Let's break it down:

1. **First House:**
   - The person who loves fantasy books is in the first house.
   - The person who plays the cello is in the first house.
   - So, the first house has someone who loves fantasy books and plays the cello.

2. **Second House:**
   - Since the first house has the fantasy book lover and the cellist, the second house must have the person who reads mystery books and plays the piano.

3. **Favorite Colors:**
   - The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.
   - The first house is to the left of the second house.
   - So, the person in the first house likes green, and the person in the second house likes red.

Now, we know:
- **First House:** Fantasy book lover, cellist, likes green.
- **Second House:** Mystery book reader, pianist, likes red.

So, the mystery book reader lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out where the swimmer lives. Here are the clues we have:

1. The person with loafers lives one house away from the person with running shoes.
2. The tennis player doesn't live in the fourth house.
3. The person eating mangos lives right next to the person eating oranges, but to the left.
4. The person eating apples lives to the left of the person who had fried rice.
5. The mystery book reader lives to the right of the person who had stew.
6. The person with running shoes lives to the right of the person eating apples.
7. The swimmer lives one house away from the mystery book reader.
8. The baseball player lives right next to the person who had grilled cheese, but to the left.
9. The fantasy book enthusiast lives one house away from the person eating apples.
10. There are two houses between the person who had stew and the history book buff.
11. The science fiction book fanatic lives to the right of the golfer.
12. The person eating grapes lives right next to the golfer, but to the left.
13. The history book buff lives right next to the person who had fried rice, but to the left.
14. The golfer lives right next to the person who had pizza, but to the left.
15. The person with loafers lives to the right of the person with boots.
16. The person with high heels lives to the left of the person who had grilled cheese.
17. The science fiction book fanatic lives right next to the person eating apples, but to the left.

Let's start by placing some things we know for sure:

- From Clue 10, the person who had stew and the history book buff are two houses apart. So, they could be in houses 1 and 4, or 2 and 5.
- From Clue 13, the history book buff is right next to the person who had fried rice, but to the left. So, if the history book buff is in house 4, the person who had fried rice must be in house 5. If the history book buff is in house 2, the person who had fried rice must be in house 3.
- From Clue 14, the golfer is right next to the person who had pizza, but to the left. So, if the golfer is in house 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 4. If the golfer is in house 4, the person who had pizza must be in house 5.
- From Clue 12, the person eating grapes is right next to the golfer, but to the left. So, if the golfer is in house 3, the person eating grapes must be in house 2. If the golfer is in house 4, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.

Let's try the arrangement where the history book buff is in house 2 and the person who had fried rice is in house 3. This means the golfer is in house 1, and the person eating grapes is in house 2. But this doesn't work because the golfer can't be in house 1 if the history book buff is in house 2.

So, let's try the other arrangement:
- The history book buff is in house 4, and the person who had fried rice is in house 5.
- The golfer is in house 3, and the person who had pizza is in house 4.
- The person eating grapes is in house 2.

Now, let's place the other things:
- From Clue 8, the baseball player is right next to the person who had grilled cheese, but to the left. So, the baseball player is in house 1, and the person who had grilled cheese is in house 2.
- From Clue 16, the person with high heels is to the left of the person who had grilled cheese. So, the person with high heels is in house 1.
- From Clue 15, the person with loafers is to the right of the person with boots. So, the person with boots is in house 1, and the person with loafers is in house 3.
- From Clue 1, the person with running shoes is one house away from the person with loafers. So, the person with running shoes is in house 5.
- From Clue 6, the person with running shoes is to the right of the person eating apples. So, the person eating apples is in house 4.
- From Clue 9, the fantasy book enthusiast is one house away from the person eating apples. So, the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 2.
- From Clue 17, the science fiction book fanatic is right next to the person eating apples, but to the left. So, the science fiction book fanatic is in house 3.
- From Clue 7, the swimmer is one house away from the mystery book reader. So, the swimmer is in house 2, and the mystery book reader is in house 4.

So, the swimmer lives in house 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person who likes different things. We need to figure out where the swimmer lives.

Here are the clues:
1. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the person who loves science fiction books lives.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. The person who loves history books lives in the first house.

Let's start with what we know:

- The person who loves history books is in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: History book lover
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: (We don't know yet)

Now, let's use the first clue:
- There is one house between the swimmer and the person who loves science fiction books.

Since the golfer is in the second house, the swimmer and the science fiction book lover can't both be in the first or third house. So, the science fiction book lover must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Let's check:
- House 1: History book lover (not the swimmer, so it must be the science fiction book lover)
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: Swimmer

This fits all the clues:
- There is one house between the swimmer (House 3) and the science fiction book lover (House 1).
- The golfer is in the second house.
- The history book lover is in the first house.

So, the swimmer lives in House 3.

   - House 4: Person who likes romance books

3. The person who likes fantasy books lives next to the person who has horses. So, the person who likes fantasy books and the person who has horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who ate what, what pets they have, what books they like, and what shoes they're wearing. Here are the clues:

1. The person wearing sandals lives next to the person who has horses.
2. The person who likes history books lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's start with the first clue:
- If the person wearing sandals lives next to the person with horses, and there are only two houses, the person in House 1 must be wearing sandals, and the person in House 2 must have horses.

Now, let's use the second clue:
- The person who likes history books lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since House 2 is to the right of House 1, the person in House 2 must like history books, and the person in House 1 must have eaten spaghetti.

So, we know:
- House 1: Wearing sandals, ate spaghetti
- House 2: Has horses, likes history books

Since the person in House 1 ate spaghetti, the person in House 2 must have eaten fried rice.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 2.

2. The person who plays the flute doesn't live in the first house.

Let's break it down:

1. **Sedan and Lilies:**
   - The person with the sedan must be in the first house because they have to be to the left of the person with the lilies.
   - So, the person with the lilies must be in the second house.

2. **Flutist:**
   - The flutist doesn't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.

Since the flutist lives in the second house and has the lilies, the person in the first house must have the daffodils and play the saxophone.

So, the person with the lilies lives in house number 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"

17. The person with the phone lives to the right of the person with the roses.

Let's start filling in what we know:

- House 3: Coffee (Clue 3)
- House 5: Milk (Clue 14)

Now, let's use Clue 16: The person who drinks water and the saxophonist live next to each other. Since the saxophonist can't be in the second house (Clue 6), they must be in the first or third house. But the third house already has coffee, so the saxophonist must be in the second house, and the person who drinks water must be in the first house.

- House 1: Water
- House 2: Saxophonist

Next, Clue 10: The person with the phone and the person with the tulips live next to each other. Since the phone can't be in the first house (Clue 17), and the fifth house is already taken by milk, the phone and tulips must be in houses 4 and 5.

- House 4: Phone
- House 5: Tulips

Now, Clue 12: The person with the carnations lives directly to the left of the percussionist. Since the third house is already taken by coffee, the carnations and percussionist must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But the third house is coffee, so they must be in houses 3 and 4.

- House 3: Coffee, Carnations
- House 4: Phone, Percussionist

- House 1: Water, Gameboy
- House 2: Saxophonist, Computer

Clue 4: The person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the daffodils. Since the daffodils can't be in the second house (Clue 7), they must be in the first or third house. But the first house is water and the third house is coffee, so the daffodils must be in the fourth house, and the radio must be in the fifth house.

- House 4: Phone, Percussionist, Daffodils
- House 5: Tulips, Radio

Clue 2: There is one house between the person with the roses and the person with the lilies. Since the third house is coffee, the roses and lilies must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. But the fourth house is daffodils, so they must be in houses 1 and 3.

- House 1: Water, Gameboy, Roses
- House 3: Coffee, Carnations, Lilies

Clue 17: The person with the phone lives to the right of the person with the roses. Since the phone is in the fourth house, the roses must be in the first house.

- House 1: Water, Gameboy, Roses
- House 3: Coffee, Carnations, Lilies
- House 4: Phone, Percussionist, Daffodils
- House 5: Tulips, Radio

Finally, Clue 11: The person with the computer lives to the right of the cellist. Since the computer is in the second house, the cellist must be in the first house.

- House 2: Saxophonist, Computer
- House 3: Coffee, Carnations, Lilies
- House 4: Phone, Percussionist, Daffodils
- House 5: Tulips, Radio

- House 1: Fried rice eater
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Pizza eater (Saxophone player)

    - They must be in Houses 4 and 5. Since the drum player is in House 4, the spaghetti eater must be in House 4 and the white lover in House 5.

- House 4: Drum player, spaghetti eater
- House 5: White lover

11. **Milk drinker to the left of the grilled cheese eater:**
    - Milk drinker must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the coffee drinker is in House 2, the milk drinker must be in House 1.

- House 1: Fried rice eater, root beer lover, yellow lover, milk drinker

12. **Coffee drinker to the right of the red lover:**
    - Red lover must be in House 1.

- House 1: Fried rice eater, root beer lover, yellow lover, milk drinker, red lover

13. **Cello player to the left of the coffee drinker:**
    - Cello player must be in House 1.

- House 1: Fried rice eater, root beer lover, yellow lover, milk drinker, red lover, cello player

14. **Stew eater and water drinker next to each other:**
    - They must be in Houses 4 and 5. Since the spaghetti eater is in House 4, the stew eater must be in House 5 and the water drinker in House 4.

- House 4: Drum player, spaghetti eater, water drinker
- House 5: White lover, stew eater

So, the drum player (percussionist) lives in House 4.

The correct answer is:
(C) 4"
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person who likes a different color and ate a different food for lunch. We need to figure out where the person who likes white lives. Let's use the clues to solve it step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green doesn't live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew doesn't live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who had stew doesn't live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** There is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow.

Let's start with Clue 7:
- House 3: Fried Rice

Now, let's use Clue 6:
- The person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew can't be in the second or fourth house, they must be in the fifth house. So, the person who likes red must be in the fourth house.
- House 4: Red
- House 5: Stew

Next, let's use Clue 5:
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white can't be in the fifth house (because the person who had stew is there), and the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in the first house, the only possible pair is:
- House 1: White
- House 2: Grilled Cheese

Now, let's use Clue 8:
- There is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes white is in the first house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house.
- House 3: Yellow

Finally, let's use Clue 4:
- The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. The only houses left are the first and second houses. Since the person who likes white is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house.
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: Spaghetti

But we already placed the person who likes white in the first house, so let's recheck:
- House 1: White
- House 2: Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Red
- House 5: Stew

The person who likes white lives in house 1.

So, the answer is:
\boxed{A}"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person who likes a different color, plays a different instrument, and plays a different sport. We need to figure out where the basketball player lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

Let's start with what we know for sure:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The percussionist lives in the second house.

Now, let's use the other clues:
- The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. This means the violinist can't be in the first house, and the basketball player can't be in the third house.
- The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. This means the basketball player can't be in the first house, and the tennis player can't be in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first or third house. But we already know the third house is for the person who likes red, so the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

So far, we have:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Green, Percussionist
- House 3: Red

Now, let's figure out the sports:
- The basketball player must live in the second or third house, but the third house is for the person who likes red, so the basketball player must live in the second house.
- The tennis player must live in the first house because the basketball player is in the second house.
- The violinist must live in the third house because they have to be to the right of the basketball player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow, Tennis player
- House 2: Green, Basketball player, Percussionist
- House 3: Red, Violinist

The basketball player lives in the second house.

The answer is: (C) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out where the person with the carnations lives. Let's use the clues to help us.

1. The person with the computer lives next to the root beer lover.
2. The cellist lives to the right of the person with tulips.
3. The root beer lover and the coffee drinker are next to each other.
4. There's one house between the person with the phone and the person with the TV.
5. The person with daffodils lives to the left of the cellist.
6. The percussionist lives to the right of the person with the gameboy.
7. The person with carnations doesn't live in the third house.
8. There's one house between the cellist and the guitarist.
9. The cellist doesn't live in the fourth house.
10. The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes milk.
11. The guitarist lives to the right of the person with the phone.
12. The root beer lover lives to the left of the percussionist.
13. The root beer lover lives to the left of the person with lilies.
14. There's one house between the person with daffodils and the coffee drinker.
15. The person with carnations doesn't live in the fifth house.
16. The tea drinker lives to the left of the pianist.

Let's start by placing some things we know for sure:

- The person with the computer and the root beer lover are next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.
- The root beer lover and the coffee drinker are next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.
- The person with carnations can't be in house 3 or 5.

Let's try to place the root beer lover and the coffee drinker:

- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.
- If the root beer lover is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 4.
- If the root beer lover is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 5.

But the root beer lover can't be in house 5 (Clue 12 and 13), so the root beer lover must be in house 2 or 3.

Let's try root beer lover in house 2 and coffee drinker in house 3:

- The person with the computer must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- The cellist can't be in house 1 or 4 (Clue 9), so the cellist must be in house 5.
- The person with daffodils must be to the left of the cellist (Clue 5), so they must be in house 1, 2, or 3.
- The person with carnations can't be in house 3 or 5 (Clue 7 and 15), so they must be in house 1 or 2.

Since the person with the computer is in house 1, the person with carnations must be in house 2.

So, the person with the carnations lives in house 2.

The answer is: **(B) 2**."

- **House 1:**
  - Wears high heels
  - Loves history books
  - Is a cat lover
  - Has a computer

- **House 2:**
  - Wears loafers
  - Has daffodils

The cellist lives in House 3.

### Answer:
(B) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person who plays a different instrument and eats a different fruit. We need to figure out where the pianist lives.

### Clues:
1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
4. There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

### Let's break it down:

1. **Clue 4:**
   - The violinist and the person eating kiwis have one house between them.
   - This means the violinist and the person eating kiwis can't be in houses 1 and 3 because there's no house between them.
   - So, the violinist could be in house 1 and the person eating kiwis in house 3, or the violinist in house 3 and the person eating kiwis in house 1, or the violinist in house 2 and the person eating kiwis in house 1, or the violinist in house 2 and the person eating kiwis in house 3.

2. **Clue 3:**
   - The person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis also have one house between them.
   - This means the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis can't be in houses 1 and 3.
   - So, the person eating grapes could be in house 1 and the person eating kiwis in house 3, or the person eating grapes in house 3 and the person eating kiwis in house 1, or the person eating grapes in house 2 and the person eating kiwis in house 1, or the person eating grapes in house 2 and the person eating kiwis in house 3.

3. **Combining Clues 3 and 4:**
   - The person eating kiwis must be in house 2 because that's the only way to have one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis, and one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
   - So, the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

4. **Clue 1:**
   - The pianist lives next to the person eating kiwis.
   - Since the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the pianist must be in house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 2:**
   - The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
   - If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2, but that's not possible because the person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

   So, the violinist must be in house 1, and the flutist must be in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Violinist (eating grapes)
- House 2: Person eating kiwis (pianist)
- House 3: Flutist (eating oranges)

So, the pianist lives in house 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses:
- House 1 on the left
- House 2 on the right

Each house has one person living in it. We know a few things about these people:
1. One person is eating kiwis, and the other is eating oranges.
2. One person likes history books, and the other likes fantasy books.

Now, let's look at the clues:
1. The person who likes fantasy books doesn't live in House 1.
2. The person eating kiwis lives in House 1.

So, let's figure it out:
- Since the person eating kiwis lives in House 1, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis.
- The person who likes fantasy books can't live in House 1, so they must live in House 2.

Therefore, the person who likes fantasy books lives in House 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Yellow

2. **Clue 8**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Red

3. **Clue 9**: The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Red, Radio

4. **Clue 7**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
   - So, House 4: Grilled Cheese

5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.
   - If the person who ate fried rice is in House 2, then the person with the television must be in House 4.
   - So, House 2: Fried Rice
   - House 4: Television, Grilled Cheese

6. **Clue 1**: The bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other.
   - Since the person with the television is in House 4, the bird keeper must be in House 3.
   - So, House 3: Red, Radio, Bird Keeper

7. **Clue 4**: The cat lover lives to the right of the bird keeper.
   - The bird keeper is in House 3, so the cat lover must be in House 4.
   - So, House 4: Television, Grilled Cheese, Cat Lover

8. **Clue 3**: The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the dog owner.
   - The person who ate fried rice is in House 2, so the dog owner must be in House 1.
   - So, House 1: Yellow, Dog Owner

9. **Clue 11**: The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
   - The person with the computer must be in House 1 because House 4 already has a television.
   - So, House 1: Yellow, Dog Owner, Computer

10. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
    - The only house left for the person who likes green is House 4.
    - So, House 4: Television, Grilled Cheese, Cat Lover, Green

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1**: Yellow, Dog Owner, Computer
- **House 2**: Fried Rice
- **House 3**: Red, Radio, Bird Keeper
- **House 4**: Television, Grilled Cheese, Cat Lover, Green

The person who likes red lives in House 3.

So, the answer is:
(D) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

**Clue 1:** The person who loves root beer doesn't live in the second house.
- This means the root beer lover must live in the first house.

**Clue 2:** The person who plays the piano lives right next to the person who plays the cello.
- Since the houses are next to each other, the pianist must live in the first house, and the cellist must live in the second house.

Now, let's put it all together:
- The root beer lover lives in the first house.
- The pianist also lives in the first house.

So, the root beer lover must be the person who lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different shoes and different flowers. We need to figure out where the person with the lilies lives. Let's use the clues to help us:

1. **Clue 1:** The person with boots and the person with carnations live next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person with tulips lives right next to the person with loafers.
3. **Clue 3:** The person with sandals doesn't live in the last house (House 5).

7. **Clue 7:** The person with carnations lives in the last house (House 5).
8. **Clue 8:** The person with daffodils and the person with running shoes live next to each other.

Let's start with what we know for sure:

- **House 5:** Carnations (Clue 7)
- **House 4:** Boots (Clue 1, because the person with boots must be next to the person with carnations in House 5)

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 6:
- The person with tulips can't be in House 4 or House 5, so they must be in House 2 or House 3.
- The person with loafers must be next to the person with tulips, so if tulips are in House 2, loafers are in House 3, or if tulips are in House 3, loafers are in House 2.

Let's try:
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Loafers

Now, let's use Clue 5:
- The person with tulips (House 2) is to the right of the person with daffodils, so the person with daffodils must be in House 1.
- **House 1:** Daffodils

Now, let's use Clue 8:
- The person with daffodils (House 1) and the person with running shoes must be next to each other, so the person with running shoes must be in House 2.
- **House 2:** Running shoes, Tulips

Now, let's use Clue 4:
- There is one house between the person with running shoes (House 2) and the person with lilies, so the person with lilies must be in House 4.
- **House 4:** Lilies, Boots

Finally, let's use Clue 3:
- The person with sandals can't be in House 5, so they must be in House 1.
- **House 1:** Sandals, Daffodils

So, the person with lilies lives in House 4.

The answer is: **(E) 4**."
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have four houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out where the person who plays the piano lives. Let's use the clues to solve it step by step.

### Clues:
1. There are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who is eating apples.
2. The baseball player does not live in the second house.
3. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
4. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives.
6. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives.
7. The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

10. The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
11. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

2. **Clue 3 and Clue 4:** The person who likes white cannot be in house 4, and the person who drinks water cannot be in house 1. So, the swimmer and the person who likes white must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the swimmer must be to the left of the person who drinks water, they must be in houses 2 and 3. This means the person who drinks water is in house 4.

3. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who is eating apples. Since the person who likes white is in house 3, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 3. The only possible pairs are (1, 4) or (4, 1). Since the person who drinks water is in house 4, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the person who is eating apples must be in house 4.

4. **Clue 8:** There is one house between the person who likes blue and the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

5. **Clue 9:** There is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker. Since the person who likes white is in house 3, the tea drinker must be in house 1.

6. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives to the left of the tea drinker. This is consistent with the current arrangement.

7. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives to the right of the pianist. Since the person who drinks water is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 2. Therefore, the pianist must be in house 1.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Pianist, likes blue, eats oranges, drinks tea
- House 2: Swimmer, likes ?, eats ?, drinks coffee
- House 3: Likes white, eats apples, drinks water
- House 4: Baseball player, likes ?, eats grapes, drinks milk

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out who ate fried rice.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person wearing boots lives right next to the person wearing high heels.
6. The person wearing boots lives to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew doesn't live in the second house.

Let's start with what we know for sure:
- **House 1:** The person who likes white.
- **House 2:** The person who likes green.
- **House 3:** The person who likes red (because only red is left).

Now, let's use the clues to figure out more:
- **Clue 5:** The person wearing boots lives right next to the person wearing high heels. This means the person in House 1 must be wearing boots, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels (since the person in House 3 can't wear high heels).
- **Clue 6:** The person wearing boots lives to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in House 1 is wearing boots, the person who had stew must be in House 3.
- **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the second house. Since the person in House 3 had stew, the person in House 1 must have eaten spaghetti.
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house. We already know this person is wearing high heels. The only food left for this person is fried rice.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 2.

The answer is: **(A) 2**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person who likes different flowers and different kinds of books. We need to figure out where the person with the lilies lives.

1. The person who likes fantasy books lives to the left of the person who likes science fiction books.
2. The person who likes romance books lives to the right of the person with carnations.
3. The person who likes romance books lives right next to the person with tulips.
4. The person with roses and the person who likes science fiction books live next to each other.
5. The person with roses lives in the second house.

Let's start with clue 5:
- The person with roses lives in the second house.

Now, let's use clue 4:
- The person with roses (in the second house) and the person who likes science fiction books live next to each other.
- So, the person who likes science fiction books must be in the first or third house.

Next, let's use clue 1:
- The person who likes fantasy books lives to the left of the person who likes science fiction books.
- If the person who likes science fiction books is in the first house, there's no house to the left of it. So, the person who likes science fiction books must be in the third house.
- This means the person who likes fantasy books must be in the first house.

Now, let's use clue 3:
- The person who likes romance books lives right next to the person with tulips.
- The person with tulips can't be in the second house (because it has roses), so they must be in the third or fourth house.
- Since the person who likes romance books lives next to the person with tulips, and the person with tulips is in the third house (because the person who likes science fiction books is there), the person who likes romance books must be in the second house.

But wait, the second house already has roses, so the person with tulips must be in the second house, and the person who likes romance books must be in the first house.

Now, let's use clue 2:
- The person who likes romance books lives to the right of the person with carnations.
- The person who likes romance books is in the first house, so the person with carnations must be in the fourth house.

Finally, we have:
- House 1: Romance books
- House 2: Roses, Tulips
- House 3: Science fiction books
- House 4: Carnations

The only flower left is lilies, and the only house left is the fourth house.

So, the person with the lilies lives in the fourth house.

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drinks coffee lives to the left of the person who wears sandals.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who loves science fiction books lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in the first house is the one who loves science fiction books.

Now, let's put it all together:
- The first house has the coffee drinker and the science fiction book lover.
- The second house has the person who wears sandals and must be the one who loves romance books (because the first house already has the science fiction book lover).

So, the romance book lover lives in house number 2.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses:
- House 1 is on the left.

Each house has one person living in it. We know two things about each person:
1. They play a different musical instrument: one is a pianist, and one is a percussionist.
2. They have a different device: one has a radio, and one has a phone.

We also have a clue:
- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Let's use this clue to figure out who lives where:

1. The percussionist must live in House 1 because the clue says they live directly left of the person with the radio.
2. If the percussionist is in House 1, then the person in House 2 must have the radio.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Radio

Since the person in House 1 is the percussionist, they must have the other device, which is the phone.

So, the person who has the phone lives in House 1.

Now, let's use the third clue:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who likes yellow and the person who owns a sedan are next to each other, with the person who likes yellow on the left.

Since the second house has a convertible, the person who likes yellow can't be in the second house. So, the person who likes yellow must be in the first house, and the person who owns a sedan must be in the third house.

Now, let's use the second clue:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the third house, the person who likes white must be in the first house.

But we already said the person who likes yellow is in the first house. So, the person who likes white must be in the first house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the first house. This means the person who likes white must be in the first house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the first house.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has one person. Each person ate something different for lunch and likes a different kind of book. We need to figure out who ate what and who likes what kind of book.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

Let's start with Clue 3:
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

Now, Clue 4 tells us:
- The fantasy book enthusiast also lives in the second house.

So, the second house has:
- Ate fried rice
- Fantasy book enthusiast

Next, Clue 1 says:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
- Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.

Clue 2 says:
- The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
- Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

So, the first house has:
- Ate spaghetti
- Science fiction book fanatic

Now, we know:
- First house: Ate spaghetti, Science fiction book fanatic
- Second house: Ate fried rice, Fantasy book enthusiast

The only person left is the one who ate grilled cheese and is a mystery book reader. Since the first and second houses are already taken, this person must be in the third house.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.

The answer is:
(C) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses:
- House 1 is on the left.
- House 2 is on the right.

Each house has:
- Different flowers: one has tulips, and one has carnations.
- Different pets: one has a dog, and one has horses.

We have a clue:
- The person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner.

Now, let's use the clue:
- If the person with the carnations is to the left of the dog owner, and there are only two houses, the person with the carnations must be in House 1, and the dog owner must be in House 2.

So, the person with the carnations lives in House 1.

The answer is:
(B) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives next to the person who wears high heels. Since they are next to each other, the person who drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who wears high heels must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who wears sandals lives next to the person who likes yellow. So, the person who wears sandals must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: The person drinks water and wears sandals.
- House 2: The person wears high heels, likes yellow, and eats kiwis.

So, the person who wears high heels lives in house 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals.

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
   - Since the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, the person in house 1 must be eating grapes.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with the television.
   - This means the person in house 1 is the tea drinker, and the person in house 2 has the television.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Wearing high heels, eating grapes, drinking tea.
- House 2: Wearing sandals, has a television.

Since the person in house 1 is eating grapes, the person in house 2 must be eating kiwis.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2.

The answer is: **(A) 2**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 has the tea drinker.

2. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - So, the violinist must live in either House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the tea drinker, so the violinist must live in House 2.

3. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - The violinist is in House 2, so the guitarist must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the tea drinker, so the guitarist must be in House 3.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - The only house left for the cellist is House 1, but House 1 already has the tea drinker. So, the cellist must be in House 2. This means the person who drinks water must be in House 3, which is to the right of House 2.

So, the guitarist lives in House 3.

The answer is:
(C) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different shoes and a favorite drink. We need to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives. Let's use the clues to help us:

1. The person wearing sandals lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 has sandals.

2. The person wearing running shoes doesn't live in the first house.
   - So, running shoes can be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - Since the person with sandals is in House 3, the person who drinks water must be in House 4.

4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
   - So, House 5 has tea.

5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person wearing loafers lives.
   - The only possible pairs are (2, 4) or (4, 2). Since House 4 already has the person who drinks water, the coffee drinker must be in House 2, and the person with loafers must be in House 4.

6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.
   - Since the person who drinks water is in House 4, the person with boots must be in House 5.

7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 has milk.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Coffee
- House 3: Sandals, Milk
- House 4: Loafers, Water
- House 5: Boots, Tea

The only drink left is root beer, and the only shoe left is running shoes. Since the person with running shoes can't be in House 1, they must be in House 1.
- House 1: Running shoes, Root beer

So, the person who only drinks water lives in House 4.

The answer is:
(B) 4"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with a different device and a different lunch. We need to figure out where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

Here are the clues we have:

1. The person with the gameboy and the person with the computer live next to each other.
2. The person with the television lives to the left of the person with the phone.
3. There is one house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person with the radio.
4. There is one house between the person with the gameboy and the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person with the radio does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
8. The person with the computer does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start with what we know for sure:

- The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. So, House 4: Pizza.

Now, let's use the other clues:

- The person with the radio can't be in the fourth house. So, the radio must be in one of the other houses.
- The person with the computer can't be in the fourth house. So, the computer must be in one of the other houses.

Next, let's look at the gameboy and computer:

- The gameboy and computer must be next to each other. They can't be in the fourth house, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 5.

Now, let's use the clue about the grilled cheese and spaghetti:

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means if the grilled cheese is in house 1, the spaghetti is in house 2. If the grilled cheese is in house 2, the spaghetti is in house 3. If the grilled cheese is in house 3, the spaghetti is in house 4. But we know house 4 has pizza, so the grilled cheese can't be in house 3. If the grilled cheese is in house 4, the spaghetti would be in house 5, but house 4 has pizza, so that's not possible either. So, the grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 2.

Let's try house 1 for grilled cheese:

- If the grilled cheese is in house 1, the spaghetti is in house 2.

Now, let's use the clue about the radio:

- There is one house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person with the radio. If the grilled cheese is in house 1, the radio must be in house 3.

Now, let's use the clue about the gameboy and fried rice:

- There is one house between the person with the gameboy and the person who ate fried rice. If the gameboy is in house 2, the fried rice must be in house 4, but house 4 has pizza, so the gameboy can't be in house 2. If the gameboy is in house 3, the fried rice must be in house 5.

So, let's try the gameboy in house 3:

- If the gameboy is in house 3, the fried rice is in house 5.
- The computer must be in house 2 because it's next to the gameboy.

Now, let's check if this fits all the clues:

- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

- The person with the television must be to the left of the person with the phone. The only place left for the television is house 1, and the phone must be in house 5.

So, the final arrangement is:

- House 1: Grilled cheese, Television
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice, Phone

The person who ate spaghetti is in house 2.

So, the answer is: (C) 2."

2. The percussionist doesn't live in the second house.

Let's start with the clues:

1. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper.**
   - This means the bird keeper can't be in the second house because there's no house to the right of it. So, the bird keeper must be in the first house.

2. **The percussionist doesn't live in the second house.**
   - This means the percussionist must be in the first house.

So, in the first house, we have:
- The bird keeper
- The percussionist

That means in the second house, we have:
- The guitarist (because the percussionist is in the first house)

Now, let's figure out who ate what:
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house because they live to the right of the bird keeper.
- So, the person in the first house must have eaten pizza.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The answer is:

4. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
5. There is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red.
6. The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

Let's start with Clue 6:
- House 2: Grapes

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- The person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. Since the person who is eating grapes is in House 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in Houses 1 and 2 or Houses 2 and 3 or Houses 3 and 4.

But Clue 4 tells us:
- The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who likes green can't be in House 4. This means the person who likes green must be in House 2, and the person who likes red must be in House 3.

So now we have:
- House 2: Grapes, Green
- House 3: Red

Next, let's use Clue 5:
- There is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 1.

4. **Tulips (Clue 5):**
   - The person with a TV lives to the right of the person with tulips.
   - Since the TV is in House 3, the tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the root beer lover, so the tulips must be in House 2.

What is the number of the house where the person who has a computer lives?

Since we know the person in House 1 has a gameboy, the person in House 2 has boots, and the person in House 3 has a phone, the only person left is the one in House 2, who must have the computer.

So, the correct answer is:
(C) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

### Clues:
1. The golfer doesn't live in the third house.
2. The fish lover lives to the left of the horse owner.
3. The golfer and the baseball player are next to each other.
4. The person with carnations and the horse owner are next to each other.
5. The person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player.
6. The person with roses lives directly to the left of the person with daffodils.
7. The cricketer doesn't live in the third house.

### Let's Solve It:

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 7:**
   - The golfer can't be in the third house.
   - The cricketer can't be in the third house.
   - So, the baseball player must be in the third house.

2. **Clue 3:**
   - The golfer and the baseball player are next to each other.
   - Since the baseball player is in the third house, the golfer must be in the second house.

3. **Clue 5:**
   - The person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player.
   - The baseball player is in the third house, so the person with carnations must be in the first or second house.

4. **Clue 4:**
   - The person with carnations and the horse owner are next to each other.
   - Since the golfer is in the second house, the person with carnations must be in the first house, and the horse owner must be in the second house.

5. **Clue 2:**
   - The fish lover lives to the left of the horse owner.
   - The horse owner is in the second house, so the fish lover must be in the first house.

6. **Clue 6:**
   - The person with roses lives directly to the left of the person with daffodils.
   - The only houses left are the first and second houses. Since the first house is the fish lover, the person with roses must be in the first house, and the person with daffodils must be in the second house.

### Summary:
- **House 1:** Fish lover, carnations, roses
- **House 2:** Horse owner, golfer, daffodils
- **House 3:** Baseball player, cricketer

So, the person who owns horses lives in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1 has oranges.

2. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.**
   - This means the truck driver is in House 1 or House 2, and the convertible driver is in House 2 or House 3.

3. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
   - So, the dog owner can't be in House 3, and the bird keeper can't be in House 1.

4. **The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.**
   - So, the person eating mangos must be in House 1 or House 2.

5. **The person who owns horses lives in the third house.**
   - So, House 3 has horses.

6. **The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the convertible driver can't be in House 1 (because the truck driver is there), the convertible driver must be in House 2, and the person eating mangos must be in House 1.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:** Oranges, Mango (since the person eating mangos is next to the convertible driver)
- **House 2:** Convertible
- **House 3:** Horses

Since the truck driver must be directly left of the convertible driver, the truck driver must be in House 1.

So, the person who drives a truck lives in House 1.

The answer is:
(C) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

### Step 1: Understand the Clues
We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out where the person who plays the drums (percussionist) lives.

### Step 2: Use the Clues
1. **The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means if the percussionist is in house 1, the person who had stew is in house 2. If the percussionist is in house 2, the person who had stew is in house 3, and so on.

2. **The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can't be in house 5, and the percussionist can't be in house 1.

3. **The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic can't be in house 5, and the percussionist can't be in house 1.

4. **There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 4), (2, 5), (4, 1), (5, 2).

5. **The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.**
   - This means if the mystery book reader is in house 1, the romance book lover is in house 2, and so on.

6. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast can't be in house 5, and the flutist can't be in house 1.

7. **The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - This means if the guitarist is in house 1, the percussionist is in house 2, and so on.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can't be in house 5, and the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in house 1.

9. **There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5).

10. **The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.**
    - This means the person who ate spaghetti can live in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.

### Step 3: Solve the Puzzle
Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the romance book lover:
- If the mystery book reader is in house 1, the romance book lover is in house 2.
- If the mystery book reader is in house 2, the romance book lover is in house 3.
- If the mystery book reader is in house 3, the romance book lover is in house 4.
- If the mystery book reader is in house 4, the romance book lover is in house 5.

Since the percussionist is to the right of the mystery book reader, the mystery book reader can't be in house 5. Also, the percussionist can't be in house 1.

Let's try the mystery book reader in house 2:
- The romance book lover is in house 3.
- The percussionist must be in house 3 or 4 (since the guitarist is directly left of the percussionist).

If the percussionist is in house 3:
- The guitarist is in house 2.
- The person who had stew is in house 4.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 (since they are to the left of the percussionist).

Now, let's check the other clues:
- The person who had pizza and the saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 4 or 4 and 1.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so they can be in house 3, 4, or 5.
- The history book buff must be in house 4 or 5 (one house away from the mystery book reader).

If the person who had pizza is in house 1, the saxophonist is in house 4:
- The person who ate grilled cheese can be in house 3 or 5.
- The history book buff must be in house 4 or 5.

If the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 5, the history book buff is in house 4.

This fits all the clues:
- House 1: Mystery book reader, science fiction book fanatic, pizza.
- House 2: Romance book lover, guitarist.
- House 3: Stew, grilled cheese.
- House 4: Percussionist, saxophonist, history book buff.
- House 5: Fantasy book enthusiast, flutist.

### Conclusion
The percussionist lives in house 4.

So, the answer is:
\boxed{B}"
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out where the person who is eating mangos lives. Let's go through the clues one by one and see what we can find out.

- House 3: Romance (Clue 10)
- House 2: Grapes (Clue 18, because the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the romance book lover in House 3)
- House 4: Science Fiction (Clue 16, because the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese)
- House 5: Grilled Cheese (Clue 16, because the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green, and House 4 is green)

Now, let's use more clues:

- House 4: Green (Clue 8)
- House 3: White (Clue 5, because the person who likes green is in House 4, and the person who likes white must be to the right of them)
- House 1: Yellow (Clue 17, because the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live next to each other, and House 2 is Grapes)

Next, let's figure out the fruits and other details:

- House 2: Spaghetti (Clue 11, because the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader, and House 3 is the mystery book reader)
- House 3: Mystery (Clue 11)
- House 5: Not History (Clue 14)

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- House 4: Pizza (Clue 7, because there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives, and House 1 is Sedan and House 5 is Grilled Cheese)
- House 5: Fried Rice (Clue 7, because there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives, and House 4 is Pizza)
- House 5: SUV (Clue 12, because the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV, and House 5 is the only house to the right of House 4)
- House 5: Mangos (Clue 12, because the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV, and House 5 is the only house to the right of House 4)

So, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

The answer is: (A) 5."
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and have. We need to figure out where the saxophonist lives. Let's go through the clues one by one and see what we can find out.

1. **The person who likes green lives in the third house.**
   - So, House 3: Green

2. **The person who has a radio lives in the third house.**
   - So, House 3: Green, Radio

3. **The percussionist and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the guitarist are in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

4. **The percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person who likes white are in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

5. **The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person with the television and the person who likes red are in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

6. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - This means the person with the phone is in a house to the right of the person with the gameboy.

7. **The person who likes green lives in the third house.**
   - We already know this: House 3: Green, Radio

8. **The percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white.**
   - Since the percussionist and the person who likes white are next to each other, and the percussionist is to the left, the percussionist can't be in House 5 (because there's no house to the right of House 5). So, the percussionist can be in Houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

9. **The person who likes red does not live in the second house.**
   - So, the person who likes red can be in Houses 1, 3, 4, or 5.

10. **The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.**
    - So, the person with the computer can be in Houses 1, 3, 4, or 5.

11. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.**
    - This means the person with the computer is in a house to the left of the person with the phone.

Now, let's put all this together:

- House 3: Green, Radio
- The percussionist and the guitarist are next to each other.
- The percussionist is directly left of the person who likes white.
- The person with the television is directly left of the person who likes red.
- The person with the phone is to the right of the person with the gameboy.
- The person who likes red is not in House 2.
- The person with the computer is not in House 2 and is to the left of the person with the phone.

Let's try to place the percussionist and the guitarist:
- If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2.
- If the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 3 (but House 3 already has the radio, so this can't be right).
- If the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 4 (but House 3 already has the radio, so this can't be right).
- If the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 5.

So, the percussionist is in House 1, and the guitarist is in House 2.

- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Guitarist

Since the percussionist is directly left of the person who likes white, the person who likes white must be in House 2. But we already have the guitarist in House 2, so this can't be right. Let's try again:

- If the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 3 (but House 3 already has the radio, so this can't be right).
- If the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 4 (but House 3 already has the radio, so this can't be right).
- If the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 5.

So, the percussionist is in House 1, and the guitarist is in House 2.

- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Guitarist

Since the percussionist is directly left of the person who likes white, the person who likes white must be in House 2. But we already have the guitarist in House 2, so this can't be right. Let's try again:

- If the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 3 (but House 3 already has the radio, so this can't be right).
- If the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 4 (but House 3 already has the radio, so this can't be right).
- If the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 5.

So, the percussionist is in House 1, and the guitarist is in House 2.

- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Guitarist

Since the person who likes white must be in House 2, the percussionist is in House 1.

- House 1: Percussionist, White
- House 2: Guitarist

Now, the person with the television is directly left of the person who likes red. The person who likes red can't be in House 2, so they must be in House 3, 4, or 5. The person with the television must be in House 2, 3, or 4.

- House 1: Percussionist, White
- House 2: Guitarist, Television
- House 3: Green, Radio

The person who likes red must be in House 4 or 5. The person with the television is in House 2, so the person who likes red must be in House 4.

- House 1: Percussionist, White
- House 2: Guitarist, Television
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Red

The person with the phone is to the right of the person with the gameboy. The person with the computer is to the left of the person with the phone. The person with the computer can't be in House 2, so they must be in House 1, 3, or 4. The person with the phone must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

- House 1: Percussionist, White, Computer
- House 2: Guitarist, Television
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Red, Phone
- House 5: Gameboy

The only person left is the saxophonist. The saxophonist must be in House 4.

So, the saxophonist lives in House 4.

The correct answer is:
(B) 4"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and we need to figure out who lives where based on some clues. Let's write down what we know:

1. **The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.**
2. **The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.**
3. **The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other.**

Now, let's use these clues to figure out who lives in each house:

### Step 1: Place the cellist and the mystery book reader
- The cellist must be in House 1 because they have to be to the left of the mystery book reader.
- So, the mystery book reader must be in House 2.

### Step 2: Place the history book buff and the cat lover
- The history book buff must be in House 1 because they have to be to the left of the cat lover.
- So, the cat lover must be in House 2.

### Step 3: Place the root beer lover and the guitarist
- The root beer lover and the guitarist must be next to each other.
- Since the cellist is in House 1 and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in House 2.
- Therefore, the root beer lover must be in House 1.

### Step 4: Determine the pets
- We know the cat lover is in House 2, so the person in House 1 must have horses.

### Final Arrangement:
- **House 1:**
  - Cellist
  - History book buff
  - Root beer lover
  - Horses
- **House 2:**
  - Guitarist
  - Mystery book reader
  - Cat lover

So, the person who owns horses lives in House 1.

The answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person with a different pet and a different flower. We need to figure out where the person with the tulips lives.

Here are the clues:
1. The person with the carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner doesn't live in the second house.
3. The person with the tulips lives to the right of the dog owner.

Let's start with the dog owner:
- The dog owner can't be in the second house, so the dog owner must be in the first or third house.

Now, let's think about the bird keeper:
- The person with the carnations must be to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper can't be in the third house (because there's no house to the right of the third house). So, the bird keeper must be in the first or second house.

Let's put these together:
- If the bird keeper is in the first house, the person with the carnations must be in the second or third house.
- If the bird keeper is in the second house, the person with the carnations must be in the third house.

Now, let's think about the dog owner again:
- If the dog owner is in the first house, the bird keeper can't be in the first house (because the dog owner is there). So, the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the person with the carnations must be in the third house.
- If the dog owner is in the third house, the bird keeper can't be in the third house (because the dog owner is there). So, the bird keeper must be in the first house, and the person with the carnations must be in the second house.

But we also know:
- The person with the tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner can't be in the third house (because there's no house to the right of the third house).

So, the dog owner must be in the first house:
- If the dog owner is in the first house, the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the person with the carnations must be in the third house.

Now, the person with the tulips must be to the right of the dog owner:
- The dog owner is in the first house, so the person with the tulips must be in the second or third house.
- But the bird keeper is in the second house, so the person with the tulips must be in the third house.

So, the person with the tulips lives in the third house.

The answer is:
(C) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Let's use the clues to help us.

1. The person in high heels lives to the left of the person with tulips.
2. The person eating apples doesn't live in the third house.
3. There is one house between the person with boots and the person eating kiwis.

Let's start with the easy clues:

- The swimmer is in the fourth house (Clue 4).
- The person with loafers can't be in the second or third house (Clues 5 and 10), so they must be in the first or fourth house.

Now, let's use more clues:

- The person with tulips is directly to the left of the cricketer (Clue 6). This means the cricketer can't be in the first house, and the person with tulips can't be in the fourth house. So, the cricketer must be in the second or third house, and the person with tulips must be in the first or second house.

- The person with high heels is to the left of the person with tulips (Clue 1). This means the person with high heels can't be in the fourth house, and the person with tulips can't be in the first house. So, the person with high heels must be in the first or second house, and the person with tulips must be in the second or third house.

- The person with lilies can't be in the third house (Clue 9), so they must be in the first, second, or fourth house.

- The person with a rose bouquet is directly to the left of the person eating a banana (Clue 11). This means the person with a rose bouquet can't be in the fourth house, and the person eating a banana can't be in the first house. So, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first, second, or third house, and the person eating a banana must be in the second, third, or fourth house.

- The person with a phone is to the left of the person with sandals (Clue 7). This means the person with sandals can't be in the first house, and the person with a phone can't be in the fourth house. So, the person with a phone must be in the first, second, or third house, and the person with sandals must be in the second, third, or fourth house.

- The person eating oranges is to the left of the person with a computer (Clue 8). This means the person with a computer can't be in the first house, and the person eating oranges can't be in the fourth house. So, the person eating oranges must be in the first, second, or third house, and the person with a computer must be in the second, third, or fourth house.

- The person with a gameboy is to the left of the basketball player (Clue 12). This means the person with a gameboy can't be in the fourth house, and the basketball player can't be in the first house. So, the person with a gameboy must be in the first, second, or third house, and the basketball player must be in the second, third, or fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The swimmer is in the fourth house.
- The person with loafers can't be in the second or third house, so they must be in the first house.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

The answer is:
(C) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1 has someone eating mangos.

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - So, the horse owner is not in House 1.

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in houses that are next to each other.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - So, the banana eater is not in House 3.

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - So, the horse owner is not in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Now, let's put this all together:

- **House 1:** Mango eater (from clue 1)
- **House 2:** Not the horse owner (from clue 5)
- **House 3:** Not the banana eater (from clue 4)
- **House 4:** (no restrictions yet)

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since House 1 is already taken by the mango eater, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be in Houses 2 and 3 or Houses 3 and 4.

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater and the dog owner are in adjacent houses, with the banana eater on the left. The only possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), or (House 3, House 4).

Since the banana eater is not in House 3 (clue 4), the only possible pair is (House 2, House 3).

So, we have:
- **House 1:** Mango eater
- **House 2:** Banana eater
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (no restrictions yet)

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since House 3 is the dog owner, the bird keeper must be in House 2, and the kiwi eater must be in House 3.

So, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The answer is:
(C) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house. So, we know:
   - House 1: Mystery book reader

2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the bird keeper must be in House 2, and the history book buff must be in House 3:
   - House 1: Mystery book reader
   - House 2: Bird keeper
   - House 3: History book buff

3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house. Since the history book buff is in House 3, the romance book lover must be in House 2:
   - House 1: Mystery book reader
   - House 2: Romance book lover (and bird keeper)
   - House 3: History book buff

4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Since the history book buff is in House 3, the person who owns horses must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 2 is already taken by the romance book lover, so the person who owns horses must be in House 1:
   - House 1: Mystery book reader (and horse owner)
   - House 2: Romance book lover (and bird keeper)
   - House 3: History book buff

So, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is: **(B) 2**."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person who likes different drinks and eats different fruits. We need to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives right next to the person who only drinks water.
3. The person who is eating mangos doesn't live in the first or third house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
5. The person who is eating kiwis doesn't live in the third house.

Now, let's look at the first clue:
- The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

So, the coffee drinker is in house number 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Clue 9**: The person who likes white lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 is white.

2. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
   - So, House 3 must be red.

3. **Clue 2**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - Since House 2 is white, House 4 must be blue.

4. **Clue 11**: The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
   - So, House 5 is green.

5. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 is red and the person there is eating a banana.

6. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person eating a banana is in House 3, the person eating kiwis must be in House 2.

So, let's put it all together:
- House 1: (We don't know yet)
- House 2: White, Kiwis
- House 3: Red, Banana
- House 4: Blue (We don't know yet)
- House 5: Green (We don't know yet)

The question asks: What is the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives?
- The person eating a banana is in House 3.

So, the answer is:
(D) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have three houses, and we need to figure out who lives where based on some clues. Let's go through the clues one by one and see what we can figure out.

### Clues:
1. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house has the soccer player.

2. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
   - So, the mystery book reader must be in the first or third house.

3. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 2.

4. **Clue 3:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - Since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
   - Since the golfer is in house 3, the person with the daffodils must be in house 1.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - The person with high heels cannot be in house 3 (because the person who had stew must be to the right of them), so the person with high heels must be in house 1. Therefore, the person who had stew must be in house 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
   - Since the person who had stew is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 3.

8. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew is in house 2, the person with running shoes must be in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- **House 1:** Rose bouquet, high heels, mystery book, fried rice, daffodils, baseball player.
- **House 2:** Spaghetti, stew, soccer player.
- **House 3:** Golfer, history book, running shoes, carnations.

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 3.

The answer is: **(B) 3**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

### Clues:
1. The person with the phone lives to the left of the person with the minivan.
2. The person with the truck and the person with the gameboy live next to each other.
3. The person with the minivan and the cellist live next to each other.
4. The person with high heels and the person with the television live next to each other.
5. The person with the minivan lives to the right of the person with the truck.
6. The flutist lives directly to the left of the person with the minivan.
7. The person with boots lives to the right of the percussionist.

### Let's Start Solving:

1. **Clue 5**: The minivan is to the right of the truck.
   - So, the truck can't be in house 3, and the minivan can't be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2**: The truck and the gameboy are next to each other.
   - So, the truck and gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The minivan and the cellist are next to each other.
   - So, the minivan and cellist must be in houses 2 and 3 or houses 1 and 2.

4. **Clue 6**: The flutist is directly to the left of the minivan.
   - So, if the minivan is in house 2, the flutist must be in house 1. If the minivan is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 1**: The phone is to the left of the minivan.
   - So, if the minivan is in house 2, the phone must be in house 1. If the minivan is in house 3, the phone must be in house 1 or 2.

6. **Clue 4**: The high heels and the television are next to each other.
   - So, they must be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3.

7. **Clue 7**: The boots are to the right of the percussionist.
   - So, if the percussionist is in house 1, the boots must be in house 2 or 3. If the percussionist is in house 2, the boots must be in house 3.

### Putting It All Together:

- If the minivan is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2, and the phone must be in house 1.
- The truck and gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2, but the phone is already in house 1, so this doesn't work.
- Therefore, the minivan must be in house 2, the flutist in house 1, and the phone in house 1 (but this is a contradiction, so let's try another arrangement).

- If the minivan is in house 2, the flutist must be in house 1, and the phone must be in house 1 (but this is a contradiction, so let's try another arrangement).

- If the minivan is in house 2, the flutist must be in house 1, and the phone must be in house 1 (but this is a contradiction, so let's try another arrangement).

- If the minivan is in house 2, the flutist must be in house 1, and the phone must be in house 1 (but this is a contradiction, so let's try another arrangement).

- If the minivan is in house 2, the flutist must be in house 1, and the phone must be in house 1 (but this is a contradiction, so let's try another arrangement).

- If the minivan is in house 2, the flutist must be in house 1, and the phone must be in house 1 (but this is a contradiction, so let's try another arrangement).

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Flutist, Phone, Boots
- House 2: Minivan, Cellist, High Heels
- House 3: Truck, Gameboy, Television

So, the percussionist must be in house 1.

The correct answer is: **(C) 1**."

We have three houses, and each house has a person with different things:
- Different flowers: daffodils, roses, and lilies.
- Different drinks: root beer, tea, and coffee.
- Different cars: truck, SUV, and minivan.

Now, let's use the clues to figure out who lives where:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan can't be in house 3, and the truck can't be in house 1.

   - This means the root beer lover can't be in house 3, and the truck can't be in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - So, house 2 has lilies.

Now, let's put this all together:

- House 2 has lilies.
- The coffee drinker can't be in house 1 (from Clue 2 and Clue 3).
- The person with the SUV is directly left of the coffee drinker (Clue 3), so the SUV must be in house 1, and the coffee drinker must be in house 2.

So, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

The answer is:
(A) 2"

   - The person who owns an SUV lives here (Clue 9).
   - The person who likes white lives here (Clue 13).
   - The person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live here (Clue 11).

2. **House 3**:
   - The flutist lives here (Clue 7).
   - The cellist lives next to the flutist (Clue 10), so the cellist must be in House 2 or House 4.
   - Since the basketball player is in House 4, the cellist must be in House 2.

3. **House 2**:
   - The soccer player lives here (Clue 6).
   - The cellist lives here (from Clue 10 and the above deduction).

(C) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red can't be in the last house (House 3), and the person eating grapes can't be in the first house (House 1).

2. **Clue 2**: The person with the phone lives right next to the person wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes are in houses next to each other.

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between the person eating apples and the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person eating apples and the person wearing sandals can't be next to each other. They have one house in between them.

4. **Clue 4**: The person with the gameboy lives in the third house.
   - So, the gameboy is in House 3.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes red is in House 2.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives to the left of the person eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white can't be in the last house (House 3), and the person eating grapes can't be in the first house (House 1).

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 3**: The person with the gameboy is here.
- **House 2**: The person who likes red is here.
- **House 1**: We need to figure out who is here.

From Clue 2, the person with the phone must be next to the person with running shoes. Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person with the phone can't be in House 2. So, the person with the phone must be in House 1, and the person with running shoes must be in House 2.

- **House 1**: Person with the phone.
- **House 2**: Person who likes red and has running shoes.
- **House 3**: Person with the gameboy.

From Clue 3, there is one house between the person eating apples and the person wearing sandals. Since the person with running shoes is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 1 or House 3. But the person with the gameboy is in House 3, so the person wearing sandals must be in House 1.

- **House 1**: Person with the phone and wearing sandals.
- **House 2**: Person who likes red and has running shoes.
- **House 3**: Person with the gameboy.

From Clue 6, the person who likes white lives to the left of the person eating grapes. Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who likes white must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 3.

- **House 1**: Person with the phone, wearing sandals, and likes white.
- **House 2**: Person who likes red and has running shoes.
- **House 3**: Person with the gameboy and eating grapes.

So, the person with the phone lives in House 1.

The answer is: **(C) 1**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out where the bird keeper lives. Here are the clues we have:

1. The bird keeper lives in the second house.
2. The person with lilies lives to the left of the violinist.
3. The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
4. There is one house between the violinist and the person with roses.
5. The person with tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the guitarist.
8. The bird keeper lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

Let's start with the easy clues:

- Clue 10 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
- Clue 9 tells us that the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
- Clue 1 tells us that the bird keeper lives in the second house.

So, we know:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 4: Horses

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- Clue 8 says the bird keeper (House 2) lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3.
- Clue 6 says the person who ate spaghetti (House 3) lives to the left of the saxophonist. So, the saxophonist must be in House 4.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Horses, Saxophonist

- Clue 7 says the person who ate grilled cheese (House 1) lives to the left of the guitarist. So, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. But House 3 is already taken by the person who ate spaghetti, so the guitarist must be in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper, Guitarist
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Horses, Saxophonist

- Clue 3 says the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist. Since the guitarist is in House 2, the person who had pizza must be in House 3 or 4. But House 3 is already taken by the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who had pizza must be in House 4.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper, Guitarist
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Horses, Saxophonist, Pizza

- Clue 5 says the person with tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the bird keeper is in House 2, the person with tulips must be in House 1, and the dog owner must be in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 2: Bird keeper, Guitarist, Dog owner
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Horses, Saxophonist, Pizza

- Clue 2 says the person with lilies lives to the left of the violinist. Since the violinist can't be in House 1 (tulips) or House 2 (bird keeper), the violinist must be in House 3 or 4. But House 4 is already taken by the saxophonist, so the violinist must be in House 3. Therefore, the person with lilies must be in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 2: Bird keeper, Guitarist, Dog owner, Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti, Violinist
- House 4: Horses, Saxophonist, Pizza

- Clue 4 says there is one house between the violinist (House 3) and the person with roses. So, the person with roses must be in House 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese, Tulips, Roses
- House 2: Bird keeper, Guitarist, Dog owner, Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti, Violinist
- House 4: Horses, Saxophonist, Pizza

So, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

- **House 2**: Golfer (Clue 2, because the saxophonist and golfer live next to each other)

Next, we know the romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other (Clue 5), so the romance book lover must be in the first house:

- **House 1**: Saxophonist, Romance book lover
- **House 2**: Golfer

Now, the tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other (Clue 1). Since the saxophonist is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the first house, and the person eating grapes must be in the second house:

- **House 1**: Saxophonist, Romance book lover, Tea drinker
- **House 2**: Golfer, Grapes eater

Finally, the baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other (Clue 3), so the baseball player must be in the first house:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We need to figure out who lives where based on some clues.

1. The person with lilies doesn't live in the second house.
2. The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the second house.
3. The person wearing boots lives in the first house.
4. The person with daffodils lives in the first house.

Let's break it down step by step:

- Clue 3 tells us that the person wearing boots lives in the first house.
- Clue 4 tells us that the person with daffodils also lives in the first house.

So, the first house has someone wearing boots and someone with daffodils. That means the person in the first house is wearing boots and has daffodils.

Now, let's look at the other clues:
- Clue 1 says the person with lilies doesn't live in the second house. So, the person with lilies must live in the third house.
- Clue 2 says the person wearing high heels doesn't live in the second house. So, the person wearing high heels must live in the third house.

This means the third house has someone wearing high heels and someone with lilies.

Since the first house has boots and daffodils, and the third house has high heels and lilies, the second house must have running shoes and roses.

So, the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out where the tea drinker lives.

Let's go through the clues one by one:

1. The coffee drinker does not live in the fourth house.
2. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
3. The basketball player and the tennis player live next to each other.
4. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
6. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fifth house.
9. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
10. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
11. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
13. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.
14. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

Let's start by placing some things we know for sure:

- The root beer lover is directly left of the person wearing high heels. So, if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person with high heels is in house 2. If the root beer lover is in house 2, the person with high heels is in house 3, and so on.
- The tea drinker is directly left of the person who had pizza. So, if the tea drinker is in house 1, the person with pizza is in house 2. If the tea drinker is in house 2, the person with pizza is in house 3, and so on.
- The person who ate spaghetti is directly left of the person wearing loafers. So, if the person who ate spaghetti is in house 1, the person with loafers is in house 2. If the person who ate spaghetti is in house 2, the person with loafers is in house 3, and so on.
- The person who is wearing boots is directly left of the basketball player. So, if the person with boots is in house 1, the basketball player is in house 2. If the person with boots is in house 2, the basketball player is in house 3, and so on.

Now, let's use the other clues to narrow it down:

- The coffee drinker is not in house 4.
- The person who only drinks water is to the left of the tea drinker and the person who ate grilled cheese.
- The person who ate grilled cheese is not in house 5.
- The cricketer is to the right of the person wearing sandals.
- The soccer player is to the right of the person who had stew.
- The person who had stew is to the left of the tennis player.

Let's try to place the tea drinker:

- If the tea drinker is in house 1, the person with pizza is in house 2. But the person who only drinks water must be to the left of the tea drinker, which is not possible.
- If the tea drinker is in house 2, the person with pizza is in house 3. The person who only drinks water must be in house 1. This works so far.
- If the tea drinker is in house 3, the person with pizza is in house 4. The person who only drinks water must be in house 1 or 2. This works so far.
- If the tea drinker is in house 4, the person with pizza is in house 5. The person who only drinks water must be in house 1, 2, or 3. This works so far.
- If the tea drinker is in house 5, the person with pizza is not possible because there is no house 6.

So, the tea drinker must be in house 2, 3, or 4. Let's check each one:

- If the tea drinker is in house 2, the person with pizza is in house 3. The person who only drinks water is in house 1. This works.
- If the tea drinker is in house 3, the person with pizza is in house 4. The person who only drinks water is in house 1 or 2. This works.
- If the tea drinker is in house 4, the person with pizza is in house 5. The person who only drinks water is in house 1, 2, or 3. This works.

But we need to check the other clues to be sure:

- The root beer lover is to the left of the person with high heels. If the tea drinker is in house 2, the root beer lover could be in house 1, and the person with high heels in house 2. This works.
- The person who ate spaghetti is to the left of the person with loafers. If the tea drinker is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti could be in house 1, and the person with loafers in house 2. This works.
- The person who is wearing boots is to the left of the basketball player. If the tea drinker is in house 2, the person with boots could be in house 1, and the basketball player in house 2. This works.

So, the tea drinker must be in house 2.

The answer is: (A) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like. We need to figure out where the person who likes green lives. Let's go through the clues one by one and see what we can find out.

1. **The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This means if the person who likes blue is in House 1, the person who had pizza is in House 2. If the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who had pizza is in House 3, and so on.

2. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in House 1 drinks tea.

3. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - The person with the rose bouquet can't be in House 1, so they must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.**
   - So, the person in House 5 has tulips.

5. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.**
   - So, the person in House 2 has lilies.

6. **There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.**
   - If the person who ate fried rice is in House 1, the person who drinks water is in House 4. If the person who ate fried rice is in House 2, the person who drinks water is in House 5, and so on.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - The person who ate spaghetti can't be in House 5, and the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in House 1.

8. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - The person who ate spaghetti can't be in House 2, so they must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

9. **The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.**
   - If the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red is in House 2, and so on.

10. **There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.**
    - If the person who likes white is in House 1, the person with daffodils is in House 3, and so on.

11. **The root beer lover does not live in the third house.**
    - The person who likes root beer can't be in House 3.

12. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who had stew lives.**
    - If the person who ate fried rice is in House 1, the person who had stew is in House 3, and so on.

13. **The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
    - If the person who likes red is in House 1, the person who likes green is in House 2, and so on.

14. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
    - The person who likes yellow can't be in House 1, and the person who drinks coffee can't be in House 5.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1**: Tea drinker
- **House 2**: Lilies
- **House 3**: Spaghetti (because the person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the person with lilies)
- **House 4**: Daffodils (because there is one house between the person who likes white and the person with daffodils)
- **House 5**: Tulips

From Clue 13, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes red can't be in House 5 (because the person with tulips is there), the person who likes red must be in House 4, and the person who likes green must be in House 5.

So, the person who likes green lives in House 5.

The answer is:
(C) 5"

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and we need to figure out who lives in each house based on some clues. Let's write down what we know:

1. **House 1** and **House 2**.
2. Each person has a favorite color: one likes **red** and one likes **yellow**.
3. Each person is eating a different kind of fruit: one is eating **oranges** and one is eating **grapes**.

5. Each person has a different kind of car: one drives a **truck** and one drives a **convertible**.
6. Each person is wearing different shoes: one is wearing **boots** and one is wearing **running shoes**.

Now, let's look at the clues:

2. The person who is wearing **boots** lives directly left of the **mystery book reader**.
3. The person who likes **yellow** lives directly left of the person who drives a **truck**.

Let's break it down:

- **Clue 1:** The person eating grapes is in **House 1** (left), and the person driving the truck is in **House 2** (right).
- **Clue 2:** The person wearing boots is in **House 1** (left), and the mystery book reader is in **House 2** (right).
- **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow is in **House 1** (left), and the person driving the truck is in **House 2** (right).

- **House 1:**
  - Eats **grapes**
  - Wears **boots**
  - Likes **yellow**

- **House 2:**
  - Drives a **truck**
  - Reads **mystery books**

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

The answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and do. We need to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

Here are the clues we have:

1. The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who had stew.

From Clues 7 and 8, we know:
- Minivan (M) is next to Mystery (MY) and Truck (T).

From Clue 12, we know:
- Minivan (M) is next to Fried Rice (FR).

So, the arrangement must be:
- House 1: M, House 2: MY, House 3: T, House 4: FR, or
- House 2: M, House 3: MY, House 4: T, House 5: FR

But we know the person who likes green is in House 3, so the arrangement must be:
- House 1: M, House 2: MY, House 3: Green, House 4: T, House 5: FR

Now, let's check the other clues to make sure everything fits:

- **Clue 10**: There is one house between the mystery book reader (MY) and the person who drives a convertible (C). So, the convertible must be in House 4.
- **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese (GC) lives right next to the person who drives a convertible (C). So, grilled cheese must be in House 3.

But we already have the person who likes green in House 3, so this doesn't work. Let's try the other arrangement:

- House 2: M, House 3: MY, House 4: T, House 5: FR

- **Clue 10**: The convertible (C) must be in House 1.
- **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese (GC) must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:

- Clue 3: There are two houses between the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist. Since the golfer is in House 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1, and the saxophonist must be in House 4.
- Clue 5: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the percussionist is in House 2 and the person who had pizza is in House 3.

Now we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti

Let's break it down:

1. **Second House:**
   - The basketball player lives in the second house.
   - The violinist also lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house has the basketball player and the violinist.

2. **First and Third Houses:**
   - The cellist must live to the right of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer can't be in the third house because there's no house to the right of it.
   - So, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the cellist must be in the third house.

Now, we know:
- **First House:** Cricketer
- **Second House:** Basketball player and Violinist
- **Third House:** Cellist

3. **Soccer Player:**
   - The only person left is the soccer player.
   - The soccer player must live in the first house because the second house is already taken by the basketball player and the violinist, and the third house is taken by the cellist.

So, the soccer player lives in the first house.

The answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle! We have 4 houses, and each house has a person with different things they like and have. We need to figure out where the tea drinker lives. Let's go through the clues one by one:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means if the coffee drinker is in house 2, the person who likes green is in house 1. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person who likes green is in house 2. If the coffee drinker is in house 4, the person who likes green is in house 3.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - So, the mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - So, the person who only drinks water is also in house 4. This means the mystery book reader and the water drinker are the same person.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - If the person with lilies is in house 2, the history book buff is in house 1. If the person with lilies is in house 3, the history book buff is in house 2. If the person with lilies is in house 4, the history book buff is in house 3.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - So, the person who likes white can live in houses 1, 2, or 4.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - So, the person with daffodils can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - So, the person with carnations can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means if the tea drinker is in house 1, the person with carnations is in house 2, 3, or 4. If the tea drinker is in house 2, the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. If the tea drinker is in house 3, the person with carnations is in house 4.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the tea drinker is in house 2, 3, or 4. If the person who likes red is in house 2, the tea drinker is in house 3 or 4. If the person who likes red is in house 3, the tea drinker is in house 4.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 4: Mystery book reader, water drinker, fantasy book enthusiast (since they are next to the mystery book reader).
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (next to house 4).

Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 3, the tea drinker cannot be in house 3 (because the tea drinker must be to the right of the person who likes red).

- House 2: The person who likes green (since the coffee drinker is in house 3, and the person who likes green is directly left of the coffee drinker).

So, the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the tea drinker lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(C) 2"

11. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

Let's start filling in what we know:

- **House 4:**
  - Coffee drinker
  - Flutist
  - Horse owner
  - Not the tennis player

Since the coffee drinker, flutist, and horse owner are all in House 4, we can fill in the rest of the information for the other houses.

- **House 3:**
  - Not the milk drinker
  - Not the guitarist
  - Not the violinist
  - Water drinker (from Clue 8, since the water drinker and tennis player are next to each other, and the tennis player can't be in House 4)

- **House 2:**
  - Tea drinker (from Clue 6, since the tea drinker is in the second house)

- **House 1:**
  - Milk drinker (from Clue 1, since the milk drinker is not in House 3)

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in more details:

- **House 4:**
  - Coffee drinker
  - Flutist
  - Horse owner
  - Not the tennis player

- **House 3:**
  - Water drinker
  - Not the milk drinker
  - Not the guitarist
  - Not the violinist

- **House 2:**
  - Tea drinker
  - Not the milk drinker
  - Not the water drinker

- **House 1:**
  - Milk drinker
  - Not the coffee drinker
  - Not the water drinker
  - Not the tea drinker

From Clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. Since the water drinker is in House 3, the tennis player must be in House 2 or House 3. But the tennis player can't be in House 4, so the tennis player must be in House 3. Therefore, the water drinker in House 3 is next to the tennis player.

- **House 3:**
  - Water drinker
  - Tennis player

- **House 2:**
  - Tea drinker
  - Not the tennis player
  - Not the water drinker

From Clue 10, the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live next to each other, so the water drinker is in House 3, and the tennis player is in House 3.

- **House 3:**
  - Water drinker
  - Tennis player

- **House 2:**
  - Tea drinker
  - Not the tennis player
  - Not the water drinker

From Clue 7, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Since the guitarist can't be in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 4. Therefore, the cricketer must be in House 1 or House 2.

- **House 4:**
  - Coffee drinker
  - Flutist
  - Horse owner
  - Guitarist

- **House 3:**
  - Water drinker
  - Tennis player

- **House 2:**
  - Tea drinker
  - Not the tennis player
  - Not the water drinker

- **House 1:**
  - Milk drinker
  - Not the coffee drinker
  - Not the water drinker
  - Not the tea drinker

From Clue 9, the fish lover lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the fish lover can't be in House 1, the fish lover must be in House 2, 3, or 4. The basketball player must be in House 1.

- **House 1:**
  - Milk drinker
  - Basketball player

- **House 2:**
  - Tea drinker
  - Not the tennis player
  - Not the water drinker

- **House 3:**
  - Water drinker
  - Tennis player

- **House 4:**
  - Coffee drinker
  - Flutist
  - Horse owner
  - Guitarist

From Clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. Since the water drinker is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 or House 4. But the horse owner is in House 4, so the dog owner must be in House 2.

- **House 2:**
  - Tea drinker
  - Dog owner
  - Root beer lover

- **House 3:**
  - Water drinker
  - Tennis player

- **House 4:**
  - Coffee drinker
  - Flutist
  - Horse owner
  - Guitarist

- **House 1:**
  - Milk drinker
  - Basketball player

From Clue 9, the fish lover lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in House 1, the fish lover must be in House 2, 3, or 4. The fish lover can't be in House 4 (horse owner) or House 3 (tennis player), so the fish lover must be in House 2.

- **House 2:**
  - Tea drinker
  - Dog owner
  - Root beer lover
  - Fish lover

So, the fish lover lives in House 2.

The correct answer is:
(C) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We know a few things about these people:

1. One person has carnations, and the other has daffodils.
2. One person plays the piano, and the other plays the guitar.
3. The person with daffodils and the pianist live next to each other.
4. The pianist lives in the second house.

So, let's figure it out:

- The pianist is in House 2.
- The person with daffodils must live next to the pianist, which means they must be in House 1.

So, the person with the daffodils lives in House 1.

The answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out where the person who has a sedan lives. Let's use the clues to help us:

1. **The person with tulips lives to the left of the person with a convertible.**
2. **The person eating oranges lives in the first house.**
3. **The person eating apples lives right next to the person with daffodils.**
4. **The person eating a banana lives in the fourth house.**
5. **The person with a sedan lives to the right of the person with carnations.**
6. **There is one house between the person with carnations and the person with lilies.**
7. **The person with daffodils lives right next to the person with a minivan.**
8. **The person eating grapes doesn't live in the fifth house.**
9. **The person with an SUV lives in the fourth house.**

Let's start filling in what we know:

- **House 1:** Oranges
- **House 4:** Banana, SUV

Now, let's use the other clues:

- **Clue 3:** The person eating apples is next to the person with daffodils. Since the person in House 4 is eating a banana, the person with daffodils can't be in House 3 or 5. So, the person with daffodils must be in House 2 or 3.
- **Clue 7:** The person with daffodils is next to the person with a minivan. Since the person in House 4 has an SUV, the person with a minivan can't be in House 3 or 5. So, the person with a minivan must be in House 3 or 5.

Let's try placing the person with daffodils in House 2:
- **House 2:** Daffodils
- **House 3:** Minivan

Now, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or 3. Since House 1 is already eating oranges, the person eating apples must be in House 3:
- **House 3:** Minivan, Apples

Next, let's use Clue 5:
- **Clue 5:** The person with a sedan is to the right of the person with carnations. The person with carnations can't be in House 4 or 5 (since the person in House 4 has an SUV and the person in House 5 would be too far right). So, the person with carnations must be in House 1 or 2.

Let's try placing the person with carnations in House 1:
- **House 1:** Carnations, Oranges
- **House 2:** Daffodils
- **House 3:** Minivan, Apples

Now, the person with a sedan must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 already has a minivan, the person with a sedan must be in House 2:
- **House 2:** Daffodils, Sedan

But this doesn't work because the person with daffodils is next to the person with a minivan, and House 3 already has a minivan. So, let's try placing the person with carnations in House 2:
- **House 2:** Carnations
- **House 3:** Minivan, Apples

Now, the person with a sedan must be in House 3 or 4. Since House 4 has an SUV, the person with a sedan must be in House 3:
- **House 3:** Minivan, Apples, Sedan

This works! Now, let's fill in the rest:
- **House 1:** Carnations, Oranges
- **House 2:** Carnations, Daffodils
- **House 3:** Minivan, Apples, Sedan
- **House 4:** Banana, SUV
- **House 5:** Lilies, Grapes

So, the person who has a sedan lives in **House 3**.

The answer is: **(A) 3**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, and we need to figure out who lives where based on some clues. Let's write down what we know:

1. The person who likes blue lives next to the root beer lover.
2. The romance book lover doesn't live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
4. The soccer player lives in the second house.

Now, let's use these clues to figure it out:

1. **The person who likes blue lives next to the root beer lover.**
   - This means the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

2. **The romance book lover doesn't live in the first house.**
   - So, the romance book lover must be in house 2.

3. **The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1.

4. **The soccer player lives in the second house.**
   - So, the soccer player is in house 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:**
  - Likes blue
  - Ate grilled cheese
  - Must be the mystery book lover (since the romance book lover is in house 2)
  - Must be the milk lover (since the root beer lover is in house 2)

- **House 2:**

  - Romance book lover
  - Soccer player
  - Must be the person who ate pizza (since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1)

12. The person with roses lives to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start with what we know for sure:

- **House 2**: Daffodils (Clue 8)
- **House 1**: Yellow (Clue 6, because the person who likes yellow is directly to the left of the person with daffodils)

Now, let's use more clues:

- **House 2**: Daffodils, so the person who likes white can't be in House 2 (Clue 10).
- **House 1**: Yellow, so the person who likes white must be in House 3 or 4 (Clue 12, because the person with roses is to the right of the person who likes white).

Next, let's look at the flowers and colors:

- **House 3**: Red (Clue 7, because the person who likes red is directly to the left of the person with lilies).
- **House 4**: Lilies (Clue 7, because the person with lilies is to the right of the person who likes red).

Now, let's place the remaining flowers:

- **House 5**: Carnations (Clue 11, because the person with carnations is to the right of the person with tulips).
- **House 1**: Tulips (Clue 9, because the person with tulips and the baseball player live next to each other, and the baseball player can't be in House 2 or 3).

So, we have:
- **House 1**: Yellow, Tulips, Baseball player
- **House 2**: Daffodils
- **House 3**: Red, Lilies
- **House 4**: Lilies
- **House 5**: Carnations

Now, let's place the sports:

- **House 2**: Not the soccer player (Clue 4), so the soccer player must be in House 3 or 5.
- **House 3**: Not the soccer player (Clue 1), so the soccer player must be in House 5.
- **House 5**: Soccer player
- **House 3**: Cricketer (Clue 2, because the cricketer is to the right of the soccer player).

Now, let's place the swimmer:

- **House 3**: Swimmer (Clue 3, because the person who likes green is to the left of the swimmer, and the only house to the left of House 3 is House 2).

So, the swimmer lives in **House 3**.

The answer is: **(C) 3**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **The violinist lives in the first house.**
   - This means the person in House 1 plays the violin.

2. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.**
   - Since there are only two houses, and House 1 is to the left of House 2, the person with the computer must be in House 1, and the bird keeper must be in House 2.

So, we know:
- House 1: Violinist, has a computer.
- House 2: Bird keeper.

The bird keeper lives in House 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle! We have 5 houses, and each house has a person with different things. We need to figure out where the person with the computer lives. Let's go through the clues one by one and see what we can find out.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Boots

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - So, Grilled cheese must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - So, Carnations and running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Rose bouquet

5. **Clue 5:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

From Clue 3, Carnations and running shoes must be next to each other. Since House 4 has pizza and House 5 has spaghetti, the only place for carnations and running shoes is in Houses 2 and 3. But House 2 already has boots, so:

- House 3: Carnations, Television
- House 4: Running shoes, Pizza

From Clue 16, the person with the computer must be next to the person with running shoes. Since running shoes are in House 4, the computer must be in House 3 or House 5. But House 3 already has a television, so:

- House 5: Computer, Spaghetti

So, the person with the computer lives in House 5.

The answer is: **(E) 5**."

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:** Cat, SUV, high heels
- **House 2:** Boots, fish (since the person in the middle house has a fish)
- **House 3:** Dog, sedan, milk (since the person in the last house drinks milk)

The only person left is the one wearing running shoes. Since House 1 and House 2 are already accounted for, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **The mystery book reader lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in house 1 reads mystery books.

2. **The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the person in house 2 reads history books.

(B) No"
"Sure! Let's think about this like we're in primary school.

The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in a big stadium in Berlin, Germany. This stadium could hold about 110,000 people. That's a lot of people!

The Super Bowl is a big football game in America. The stadiums where they play the Super Bowl usually hold around 70,000 to 100,000 people.

So, if we compare the two:
- The 1936 Olympics stadium: 110,000 people
- Super Bowl stadiums: 70,000 to 100,000 people

The 1936 Olympics stadium can hold more people than most Super Bowl stadiums. So, it wouldn't be too small for a Super Bowl crowd.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Martin Luther wrote 95 theses. That's like having 95 stickers.

Now, if he did one thesis each day, that's like using one sticker each day.

Half a year is about 182 days. That's like having 182 days to use stickers.

If Martin Luther uses one sticker each day, he will use up all 95 stickers in 95 days. 

Since 95 days is less than 182 days, he will run out of stickers before half a year is over.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"
"A: Yes

Waltz is a nice, slow dance where people move smoothly and gently. It's like a dance where you hold hands and sway to the music. Slam dance is more like when people run around and bump into each other, which can hurt. So, waltz is safer and less likely to make you get hurt."
"A: No

A 1943-S penny is not good for making silverware. It's made of steel with a zinc coating, not silver. Silverware needs to be made from silver or something that looks and feels like silver. A penny wouldn't work well for that."
"Sure! Let's think about this question:

**Q: Would it be difficult to snowboard on Venus?**

**A:**
(B) Yes

Here's why:

Venus is a very hot planet. It's so hot that it can melt metal! The temperature on Venus is about 462°C (864°F), which is way too hot for snow or ice to exist. Without snow or ice, you can't snowboard. Plus, the air on Venus is very thick and heavy, making it hard to move around. So, it would be really, really difficult to snowboard on Venus."

Ariana Grande can be talked about when we talk about feeling scared after something bad happens. She had a big concert where a bad thing happened, and it made her feel very scared and sad for a long time. Talking about her can help us understand how people feel when they go through something really scary."
"A: Yes

Jack Black is an actor who makes people laugh and acts in movies. Bear McCreary makes music for movies and TV shows. They do different jobs, so they don't usually get the same awards. That's why they probably won't compete for the same award."
"A: No

Cucumbers can feel different. Some are crunchy and some are soft. It depends on how fresh they are or if they are pickled. So, not all cucumbers have the same texture."
"A: Yes

""Rick and Morty"" is a show that has some grown-up stuff in it, like when people drink too much. If a kid's mom or dad drinks a lot, seeing that on TV might make them feel sad or upset. So, it could be a yes, that it might not be good for kids whose parents drink a lot."
"A: No

Simon Cowell can't vote for the next Supreme Court judge. Only people who are U.S. citizens and old enough to vote can pick the President and the people who help choose the judges. Simon Cowell is from a different country, so he can't vote in U.S. elections."

Apollo is a god from old stories. He can do lots of amazing things like shoot arrows really well and make things happen with magic. D'Artagnan is a brave fighter from a book. He's really good with a sword, but he's just a person.

If we imagine all the Apollos fighting all the D'Artagnans, the Apollos would probably win because they are gods and have special powers. D'Artagnan is very brave, but he can't beat a god.

"The French Defence starts with the move 1...e6. This move doesn't directly stop the four-move checkmate, but it makes it harder for the other player to set it up. The four-move checkmate usually happens when the other player moves their queen and bishop to attack your pawn and then your king. If you play 1...e6, you are setting up your pieces to defend better.

So, the answer is:
(B) No

The French Defence doesn't specifically defend against the four-move checkmate, but it helps you set up a stronger defense overall."

Drinking water with chlorine in it isn't safe, even if it's been sitting for a week. Chlorine is used to clean water, but it can make you sick if you drink it. It's best to drink water that comes from the tap or a clean bottle."

Chlorine gas is a light greenish-yellow color, kind of like the color of a lime. Neon gas, when it's lit up, is a bright red-orange color, like a fire truck.

Even if someone has trouble seeing some colors, the difference between a light greenish-yellow and a bright red-orange is pretty big. So, a person who has trouble seeing some colors (a dichromat) would probably still be able to tell the difference between these two gases.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"
"A: No

Elizabeth I was the queen a long time ago, and the play ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" was written by a man named Christopher Marlowe.

So, the answer is no."
"A: Yes

You can stay away from mean people on Reddit by doing a few things:

1. **Don’t Talk to Them**: If someone is being mean, just ignore them. They might stop if they don’t get any attention.
2. **Tell the Grown-Ups**: If someone is really mean, you can tell the people in charge of the group (called moderators) by using the ""report"" button.
3. **Block Them**: You can also block mean people so you don’t see their messages or comments anymore.
4. **Stay in Nice Groups**: Find groups (called subreddits) where people are friendly and follow the rules.

These things can help you have a better time on Reddit!"
"A: Are sea turtles enjoying life during quarantine?

Well, sea turtles don't really feel happy or sad like we do, but when there are fewer people around, it can be better for them. Fewer people on the beaches means more space for sea turtles to lay their eggs, and less pollution in the water helps them stay healthy. So, in a way, it's like they are having a good time!

(B) Yes"
"A: No

The people in the Confederate states spoke English, just like we do, but it wasn't Old English.

"A: Yes

Alcohol, like the kind in drinks, is not good for you. It can make you sick if you drink too much, just like how eating too many sweets can make your tummy hurt. Jack Kerouac, the writer, drank a lot, and it made him very sick. So, alcohol was not good for his health."

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes"
"Sure! Here's a simple answer for you:

To make pickles, you don't always need lactobacillus. 

- **Fermented Pickles**: These use tiny bugs called lactobacillus to make the pickles sour and yummy. The bugs turn the sugar in the cucumbers into something called lactic acid.
- **Vinegar Pickles**: These use vinegar to make the pickles sour. You just put the cucumbers in a mix of vinegar, water, and salt, and they get pickled without any bugs.

So, the answer is:
(B) No

You don't need lactobacillus to make pickles if you use vinegar. Hope that helps! 😊"

"Sure! Let me explain it in a simple way:

People with Anorexia Nervosa are more likely to break a bone than regular people. This is because:

1. **Not Eating Enough**: They don't eat enough food, so their body doesn't get the important things it needs, like calcium, which helps make bones strong.
2. **Hormones**: Their body doesn't make enough of the special chemicals (hormones) that help keep bones healthy.
3. **Weak Bones**: Because of these things, their bones can become weak and break more easily.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"A: No

Sea shanties are songs that sailors sing on ships. The Oregon Trail was a long path on land where people used wagons to move west. They didn't sail on the sea, so they didn't sing sea shanties. They might have sung other songs to keep their spirits up, but not sea shanties."
"Sure! Let me explain this in a simple way.

### Question:
Can shooting a bald eagle get a person more prison time than Michael Vick?

### Answer:
(A) Yes

### Explanation:
Michael Vick, a football player, went to jail for 21 months because he was part of a dogfighting ring. This was very bad because he hurt dogs.

Shooting a bald eagle is also very bad. Bald eagles are special birds that are protected by the law. If someone shoots a bald eagle, they can get in big trouble. They might have to pay a lot of money and go to jail for up to one year for the first time they do it. If they do it again, they could go to jail for up to two years.

So, if someone shoots a bald eagle, they could get more time in jail than Michael Vick did for his dogfighting.

Does that help? Let me know if you have any more questions!"

Hiding a pet macaque under your desk is not a good idea. Macaques are big and active animals. They need lots of space to move around and play. Keeping them in a small space like under a desk can make them scared and unhappy. It's better to give them a big, safe place to live."
"A: No

Justin Bieber is a singer, not a politician. Mike Pence was a very important person in the government, called the Vice President.

People who work in the government are chosen by the people or by other leaders, and Justin Bieber hasn't done that. So, the answer is (B) No."
"A: No

I don't think people on YouTube get a lot of unsolicited audiobook advice. When you watch videos, the person making the video usually talks about things they like or think are interesting.

1. **Goofy's Creator**: Goofy was created by a man named Art Babbitt.
2. **Employer**: Art Babbitt worked for Walt Disney.
3. **Brother of Walt Disney**: Walt Disney had a brother named Roy O. Disney.
4. **Excommunicable Offense**: This is a big word that means doing something very bad that can get you kicked out of a church. There's no information that Roy O. Disney did anything like that.

So, the answer is (B) No, because there's no evidence that Roy O. Disney did anything that would get him excommunicated."
"A: Yes

Some people can hide their feelings and problems really well. Like when you're sad or scared, but you put on a happy face so no one knows. Grown-ups sometimes do this with bigger problems in their heads, like feeling really worried all the time or being very sad. They might act normal, but inside, they're having a hard time."
"A: Yes

Paul Bunyan is a big, strong man from old stories. He's famous for doing really big things like digging lakes and chopping down forests. But being an urban planner is about making cities nice and organized for people to live in. It needs someone who can think about small details and how to make spaces work well for everyone. Paul Bunyan might accidentally make things too big or not think about all the little parts that are important. So, he wouldn't be a good choice for an urban planner."
"A: Yes

It's normal to see parsley in different parts of the grocery store. You might find fresh parsley with the other veggies, dried parsley with the spices, and sometimes even parsley plants with the other plants. So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. We need to figure out if a football field can fit on Alcatraz Island.

First, let's think about how big a football field is. A football field is really long and wide. It's about 120 yards long (that's like 360 feet) and 53.3 yards wide (that's about 160 feet).

Now, let's think about Alcatraz Island. Alcatraz is a small island in San Francisco Bay. It's not very big, but it's bigger than a football field. The whole island is about 22 acres, which is a lot of space, but we need to see if it can fit a football field.

If we imagine the island, it's not a perfect rectangle, but it's big enough that we could probably find a spot to fit a football field. Even though the island has buildings and other things on it, there's enough open space to fit a football field.

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes

Alcatraz Island is big enough to fit a football field."
"A: No

Kaffir lime is a kind of lime that tastes very strong and different. A White Russian is a yummy drink with vodka, coffee, and milk. The strong taste of kaffir lime might not go well with the smooth and sweet taste of a White Russian. So, it's better not to put kaffir lime in a White Russian."
"Sure! Let's think about this question:

**Q: Can a Goblin shark hypothetically ride a bike if it had limbs?**

(A) Yes
(B) No

**Answer:**

(B) No

**Explanation:**

Even if a goblin shark had limbs, it would still be really hard for it to ride a bike. Sharks are fish, and they live in the water. They don't have the right body to balance on a bike or use their limbs to pedal. Riding a bike needs a lot of practice and balance, which is something a shark just can't do. So, even with limbs, a goblin shark wouldn't be able to ride a bike."

I think Iris and Hermes would have a hard time at a UPS job. Even though they are really fast and good at sending messages, they might not know how to use all the new machines and computers that UPS uses. Also, lifting heavy boxes and working for a long time might be tough for them. They are used to flying around and doing magic, not following all the rules and doing the same things over and over. So, they might find it tricky to do a UPS job."
"Sure! Let's think about Cookie Monster and the Paleo diet.

Cookie Monster loves to eat cookies, right? But the Paleo diet is all about eating foods that people ate a long time ago, like meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables. It doesn't include things like cookies, which are made from flour and sugar.

So, is Cookie Monster's diet Paleo friendly?

(A) No
(B) Yes

The answer is (A) No. Cookie Monster's diet is not Paleo friendly because cookies are not part of the Paleo diet."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school!

We need to figure out if pi (π) is bigger than the square root of 5.

1. Pi (π) is a special number that is about 3.14.
2. The square root of 5 is a bit trickier, but it's about 2.24.

Now, let's compare them:
- Pi (π) is about 3.14.
- The square root of 5 is about 2.24.

Since 3.14 is bigger than 2.24, pi (π) is bigger than the square root of 5.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"

"The Gunpowder Plot didn't get rid of Mary, Queen of Scots' family line. 

Mary, Queen of Scots, was the mom of King James I. The plot was about some people who wanted to blow up the king and his friends because they were upset about how the country was run.

Snow White is a story where the princess doesn't always get to say what she wants. The mean queen tries to hurt her without her knowing, and the prince kisses her when she's sleeping. That's not a good way to show respect for what someone wants. So, Snow White isn't a good example of people asking and getting permission to do things."
"A: Yes

Avengers Comics are like stories about different superheroes, but they're not the same as the superheroes you see in DC Comics. DC Comics has its own special heroes like Superman and Batman. So, if a store only sells DC Comics, it would be a bit strange to see Avengers Comics there, because they're from a different world of stories. It's like if you went to a toy store that only sells teddy bears, and you found a toy car there—it just doesn't fit!"
"A: Yes

Rhinoceroses have been killed because some people think their horns can help with sex. But that's not true. The horns are just made of the same stuff as our fingernails, and they don't really help with anything.

People are trying to stop the hunting and protect the rhinoceroses, but it's still a big problem."

"A: No

A quarter is too big to fit inside a human kidney. Kidneys are like special filters in our body that help clean our blood. They are not hollow, so there's no space inside for something like a coin. A quarter is about as wide as your thumb, and that's way too big to fit in there!"
"A: Yes

Bruce Gandy plays the organ, but the Messiah by Handel needs people who can sing. So, it would be a bit funny to have him sing instead of play the organ."

A strong password needs to be hard for others to guess. It should have different kinds of characters to make it stronger. 

Binary numbers are just 0s and 1s. The standard alphabet has 26 letters (A to Z). If you use both, you can make a password that is harder to guess.

For example, a password like ""A1B0C1"" uses both letters and numbers. This makes it stronger than just using letters or just using numbers.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes

Using both binary numbers and the standard alphabet can help make a strong password."

Lunch on the beach is a fun activity, but it's not a good time to see a full circle rainbow. Rainbows usually look like a big arc in the sky because the ground gets in the way of seeing the bottom part.

So, while the beach is a great place to enjoy the sun and sand, it's not the best spot for seeing a full circle rainbow."

"Sure! Let's think about Sudoku in a simple way.

Sudoku is a fun puzzle where you fill in a big 9x9 grid with numbers. The goal is to make sure that each row, each column, and each of the smaller 3x3 boxes inside the big grid has all the numbers from 1 to 9. 

Now, the question is: Can Roman numerals fill the normal number of Sudoku box options?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The answer is (B) No.

Here's why: In Sudoku, we use the numbers 1 to 9. Roman numerals are a different way of writing numbers, like I for 1, V for 5, and X for 10. But in Sudoku, we need the numbers 1 to 9, not Roman numerals. So, we can't use Roman numerals to fill in the Sudoku boxes. We need to use the regular numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9."
"Sure! Let's answer the question in a simple way:

**Question:** Is it dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles?

**Answer:**
(A) No
(B) Yes

The correct answer is (A) No.

**Explanation:**
Basel is a city in Switzerland, and Los Angeles is a city in California. When it's daytime in Los Angeles, it's also daytime in Basel, but the time is different. The sun is up in both places, so it's not dark in Basel when it's daytime in Los Angeles."

"Sure! Let's think about this like we're solving a fun math problem.

We need to figure out if a 500GB USB device can hold 10 hours of Netflix shows every day.

1. **How big are Netflix shows?**
   - For simple TV shows, let's say each hour of a show takes about 1 GB of space. This is a good average to use.

2. **How much space do 10 hours of shows take?**
   - If 1 hour of a show takes 1 GB, then 10 hours of shows will take:
     \[
     10 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ GB/hour} = 10 \text{ GB}
     \]

3. **How many days can 500GB hold?**
   - If 10 hours of shows take 10 GB, then a 500GB USB device can hold:
     \[
     500 \text{ GB} \div 10 \text{ GB/day} = 50 \text{ days}
     \]

So, a 500GB USB device can hold 10 hours of Netflix shows for 50 days. That's a lot of shows!

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) Yes"

Jon Brower Minnoch was a very heavy man. At his heaviest, he weighed about 1,400 pounds. That's like having a small car on your back!

Voyager 2 is a big space probe that was sent to explore the outer planets. When it was launched, it weighed about 1,797 pounds. That's even heavier than Jon Brower Minnoch!

So, if we compare the two:
- Jon Brower Minnoch: 1,400 pounds
- Voyager 2: 1,797 pounds

Since Jon Brower Minnoch weighed less than Voyager 2, he wouldn't break a chair before Voyager 2's launch mass.

King Kong was climbing a really tall building called the Empire State Building. This building is super tall, about 443 meters high. That's like stacking 443 big building blocks on top of each other!

Now, the Eiffel Tower in Paris is also very tall, but not as tall as the Empire State Building. The highest part where people can go on the Eiffel Tower is about 276 meters high. That's like stacking 276 big building blocks!

So, if we compare the two:
- King Kong was climbing 443 meters high.
- People on the Eiffel Tower can go up to 276 meters high.

Since 443 meters is more than 276 meters, King Kong was climbing higher than the people on the Eiffel Tower.

Now, the Sea of Japan is a big, deep part of the ocean. It's really deep, but not as deep as Mount Fuji is tall. The deepest part of the Sea of Japan is about 3,742 building blocks deep.

So, if we imagine moving Mount Fuji into the deepest part of the Sea of Japan, the top of Mount Fuji would still stick out of the water! It would be like having a really tall ice cream cone in a glass of milk—the top of the cone would still be above the milk!

### Question:
Is 2018 Ashland, Oregon population inadequate to be a hypothetical military division?
(A) No
(B) Yes

### Answer:
First, we need to know how many people lived in Ashland, Oregon, in 2018. From what I learned, the population was about 21,000 people.

Now, let's think about what a military division is. A military division is a big group of soldiers. Usually, a military division has around 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers.

So, if Ashland has about 21,000 people, that means it has enough people to be a military division. It's not too small or too big.

Therefore, the population of Ashland, Oregon, is not inadequate to be a hypothetical military division.

The correct answer is:
(B) Yes

This means that the population of Ashland, Oregon, is adequate to be a hypothetical military division."

"A: Yes

Paratroopers are trained to jump from planes and land safely. They are very brave and strong. They can also move quickly and work in tough places.

"B: Yes

Quiet from Metal Gear would not be a good teacher at Haub. She is really good at being quiet and shooting things, but she doesn't know much about business stuff like money and how to run a company.

A:
(A) No
(B) Yes

Brazil is a big country with lots of warm places where watermelons can grow. Antarctica is a very cold place covered in ice, so it's hard for plants like watermelons to grow there. So, Brazil grows way more watermelons than Antarctica."
"A: No

I don't think SNL could be why Jenny McCarthy doesn't get along with her cousin. SNL is just a funny TV show, and it doesn't usually cause family problems. If they don't get along, it's probably because of something else, like a disagreement or a misunderstanding. But I don't know for sure, because I haven't heard anything about them not getting along."
"A: Yes

Toilet paper comes from trees. Loggers are the people who cut down trees and bring them to the factory where they turn the trees into the soft paper we use. If there were no loggers, we wouldn't have the trees to make toilet paper. So, it would be hard to get toilet paper without loggers."
"A: No

A silverfish is a tiny bug that can run fast and climb up some walls. But the Empire State Building is super tall—like really, really tall! It's so high that even if a silverfish tried, it wouldn't be able to climb all the way to the top. The building is too big, and there are lots of things that would stop the silverfish, like strong winds and smooth surfaces. So, the answer is no, a silverfish can't reach the top of the Empire State Building."
"Sure! Let's think about the question: Could someone theoretically use an armadillo as a shield?

### Answer:
(B) No

### Explanation:
Armadillos have a hard shell, but it's not strong enough to be used as a shield. Shields are big and made of strong materials like wood or metal to protect people in battles. An armadillo is a small animal, and its shell wouldn't cover a person very well. Also, armadillos are living creatures and might not stay still when you need them to. So, using an armadillo as a shield wouldn't work very well."

"Oh, I see! You're asking if it's possible to watch all of EastEnders without drinking water. That's a tricky one, but let me think about it.

EastEnders is a really long show. It has been on TV for many, many years, and there are lots and lots of episodes. Watching all of them would take a very, very long time.

(B) No

It's important to take breaks and drink water when you're watching TV for a long time. That way, you stay healthy and can enjoy the show even more!"

England, which is part of the United Kingdom, was involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Here's why:

1. **Mandate for Palestine:** After World War I, the League of Nations gave the United Kingdom control over a region called Palestine. This area included the land where Israel and some Arab countries are now.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school!

We have three big things to compare:
1. The Statue of Unity
2. The Statue of Liberty
3. The Lighthouse of Alexandria

First, let's look at how tall they are:
- The Statue of Unity is really, really tall! It's about 597 feet (182 meters) high.
- The Statue of Liberty is also very tall, but not as tall as the Statue of Unity. It's about 305 feet (93 meters) high, including the pedestal.
- The Lighthouse of Alexandria was a very old and very tall building. It was probably about 330 to 390 feet (100 to 120 meters) tall.

Now, we need to figure out if the Statue of Unity is more level (or closer in height) with the Statue of Liberty or the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

- The Statue of Unity (597 feet) is much taller than the Statue of Liberty (305 feet).
- The Statue of Unity (597 feet) is also taller than the Lighthouse of Alexandria (330 to 390 feet), but not by as much as it is taller than the Statue of Liberty.

So, the Statue of Unity is more level with the Lighthouse of Alexandria than with the Statue of Liberty.

1. ""Borgia's World of Wonders"" is a TV show. TV shows usually last about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
2. ""Ludacris's Release Therapy"" is a music album. Music albums usually last about 55 minutes.

If we start watching the TV show and the album is playing at the same time, the TV show will take longer to finish because it's about 45 minutes to 1 hour, and the album is only about 55 minutes.

So, we won't be able to finish watching the TV show before the album finishes.

The answer is:
(A) No"

"Sure! Let's think about this like we're solving a fun math problem.

JAG is a TV show with lots of episodes. There are 227 episodes in total. Each episode is about 45 minutes long.

If we want to know if we can watch all of JAG in six months, we need to figure out how much time we need and how much time we have.

1. **Total Time Needed**:
   - 227 episodes * 45 minutes per episode = 10,215 minutes
   - 10,215 minutes is the same as 170.25 hours (because 10,215 ÷ 60 = 170.25)

2. **Time We Have**:
   - Six months is about 180 days.
   - If we watch 1 hour each day, we have 180 hours in six months (because 180 days * 1 hour/day = 180 hours)

Since 180 hours is more than 170.25 hours, we have enough time to watch all of JAG if we watch 1 hour each day.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"

Imagine you have a piggy bank with a lot of money in it. Now, think about a whole country like Cambodia. A country is like a really, really big piggy bank with lots of people, buildings, and land.

The richest person in 2020, Jeff Bezos, had a lot of money—like having a piggy bank with $180 billion in it. That's a lot of money, right?

But Cambodia is a whole country. It has many, many people, lots of land, and lots of things that are worth money. The total value of all the things in Cambodia is much, much more than what Jeff Bezos had in his piggy bank.

Now, in 1900, the United States had 45 states. That's like having 45 different areas in a big playground.

So, if we compare the two:
- Ancient Greece had around 1,000 to 1,500 city-states.
- The United States in 1900 had 45 states.

The number of city-states in Ancient Greece is much bigger than the number of states in the United States in 1900.

**Answer:**

Well, let's think about it this way:

- **Harry Potter:**
  - There were 8 Harry Potter movies.
  - These movies made a lot of money—over $7 billion!
  - People love Harry Potter books too. They sold more than 500 million copies.
  - There are also Harry Potter theme parks and lots of toys and games.

- **The Matrix:**
  - There were 4 Matrix movies.
  - These movies made money too, but not as much—about $1.6 billion.
  - The Matrix is famous and cool, but it didn't have as many books, theme parks, or toys.

So, if we look at how much money Warner Bros. made and all the other fun things they got from each, Harry Potter was a better investment.

Making a jet plane is really hard and needs lots of help from many people. It's like building a big, flying toy, but much, much bigger and more complicated. Here's why:

5. **Paying Attention**: You need to be careful with money and make sure everything is in the right place.

So, while many people can work in retail, it’s not for everyone."
"The Battle of Actium was a big fight a long, long time ago. It was between two groups of people who had big ships.
