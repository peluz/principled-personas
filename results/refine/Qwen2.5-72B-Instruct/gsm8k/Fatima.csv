"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original value.
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = New value of the house - Total investment
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total distance James runs each week.

James runs 3 sprints per session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find the total distance, we can use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Total meters per week} = \text{Number of sprints per session} \times \text{Distance per sprint} \times \text{Number of sessions per week} \]

So, we have:
\[ 3 \, \text{sprints/session} \times 60 \, \text{meters/sprint} \times 3 \, \text{sessions/week} = 540 \, \text{meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total distance James runs each week is 540 meters.

"To calculate the total cost for Kylar buying 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break it down as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass ($5) and one discounted glass ($3).

The total cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Add the time for the Windows restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time so far is \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the time to download the full file again:**
   - The full file size is 200 GB.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the distance John travels away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far he travels back home during the 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman who sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left. We need to find out how many vacuum cleaners she started with.

1. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

2. At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners:
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]

3. After the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

4. At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners:
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house} = 2
   \]

5. After the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

6. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left:
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

7. After the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

8. We know that after the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

9. To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]

10. Next, we add 2 to both sides:
    \[
    \frac{2x}{3} = 12
    \]

11. Finally, we multiply both sides by 3:
    \[
    2x = 36
    \]

12. And then divide by 2:
    \[
    x = 18
    \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. Let's break this down step by step to find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

1. **Contemporary Dance:**
   - 20% of 20 students = \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) students

2. **Remaining Students:**
   - Total students - Students in contemporary dance = \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) students

3. **Jazz Dance:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students = \( 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \) students

4. **Hip-Hop Dance:**
   - Remaining students after contemporary and jazz = \( 16 - 4 = 12 \) students

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance:
- Percentage of students in hip-hop dance = \( \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \)

Thus, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate Jill's annual salary based on her teaching and cheerleading coaching hours.

First, let's break down her weekly earnings:

1. **Teaching Earnings:**
   - Jill teaches for 35 hours a week at a rate of $20 per hour.
   - Weekly teaching earnings = 35 hours * $20/hour = $700.

2. **Cheerleading Coaching Earnings:**
   - Jill coaches for 15 hours a week at a rate of $30 per hour.
   - Weekly coaching earnings = 15 hours * $30/hour = $450.

Next, let's calculate her total weekly earnings:

- Total weekly earnings = Weekly teaching earnings + Weekly coaching earnings
- Total weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150.

Now, let's find her annual salary:

- Jill works 50 weeks a year.
- Annual salary = Total weekly earnings * 50 weeks

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks.

First, let's break down the problem:
- Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses \(3 \times 7 = 21\) eggs.
- Over 4 weeks, she will use \(21 \times 4 = 84\) eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84}{12} = 7 \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total time Marissa should take to complete the 12-mile trail if she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the time Marissa has already spent hiking. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. Therefore, the total time she has already spent is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

This means she has:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]
left to complete the remaining distance.

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Certainly! Let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

However, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When the remaining 9 liters of orange drink are mixed with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total volume of the mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Calculating the right side:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's break down the costs of the items Marie ordered:

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- Each pack of milk costs $3, and she bought 5 packs, so the total cost for milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Each apple costs $1.50, and she bought 4 apples, so the total cost for apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the costs of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from $50:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\].

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, let's define the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that one pair of high heels costs $33. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much, so it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \)."

Let's denote Darrell's age by \(7x\) and Allen's age by \(11x\).

The equation for their total age is:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, let's break down the guesses from each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week.

First, let's break down the problem:
- John takes care of 10 dogs.
- Each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day.

To find the total daily care time:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find the total weekly care time:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total weekly care time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of silver coins.
- \( G \) as the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \) (total number of coins)
2. \( G = S + 30 \) (30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

Let's calculate the total time he spends running each week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his average speed using the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"As a knowledgeable individual, I understand the dynamics of this scenario involving Polly and the great dragon, Perg. Polly can throw the gold javelin, which is the only known weapon capable of slaying the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet. However, when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance is tripled. 

To calculate the new throwing distance:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her new throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your nutritional math. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. According to the nutritional info, each serving has 250 calories, and there are 5 servings in the bag. So, the total number of calories in the bag is:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, we can find the number of grams per calorie:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat for 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. We need to find out how much he spent on ties in total.

1. **Calculate the number of blue ties:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of red ties:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 × Number of blue ties
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of each red tie:**
   - Each red tie costs 50% more than each blue tie.
   - Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
   \[
   \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties × Cost per red tie
   \[
   \text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   \[
   \text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800

"If Marcy works for 30 years, she will be entitled to an annual pension based on the company's policy. According to the policy, after 20 years of service, she earns an additional 5% of the full pension value for each year of service beyond 20 years.

First, let's calculate the number of years Marcy works beyond the 20-year mark:
30 years - 20 years = 10 years

For each of these 10 years, she earns an additional 5% of the full pension value. Therefore, the total percentage of the full pension she earns is:
10 years * 5% = 50%

The full pension value is $50,000 per year. So, 50% of this amount is:
50% * $50,000 = $25,000

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service will be:
$25,000

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- The football team played a total of 22 games.
- They won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's denote:
- \( W \) as the number of games won.
- \( L \) as the number of games lost.

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \) (total games played)
2. \( W = L + 8 \) (they won 8 more games than they lost)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem.

Harry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to calculate the number of hours James slept and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the hours James slept:
\[ \text{James' sleep} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we find the difference in the hours they slept:
\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When tomatoes are cooked into sauce, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce:
     \[
     32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.
   - To find out how many cans were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
4. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially was 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"As an avid gardener, I understand the joy of nurturing plants and sharing them with others. Let's calculate how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away.

Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges in her home. This gives us:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

She received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery, so the total number of potted plants she now has is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total time he spent watching TV each day and then solve for Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem. 

To find out how many friends Amy and Lily have together, we need to start by determining how many friends Amy made. According to the problem, Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Since Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate the number of friends Amy made as follows:

\[ \text{Amy's friends} = \text{Lily's friends} + 20 \]
\[ \text{Amy's friends} = 50 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Amy's friends} = 70 \]

Next, we add the number of friends Amy has to the number of friends Lily has to find the total number of friends they have together:

\[ \text{Total friends} = \text{Amy's friends} + \text{Lily's friends} \]
\[ \text{Total friends} = 70 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Total friends} = 120 \]

So, the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together is 120.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of each item:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.
   - A watermelon costs three times the cost of a pepper:
     \[
     \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon:
     \[
     \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for each type of item:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Dillon buys 20 peppers:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Dillon buys 10 oranges:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is:

"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Total Time Spent on Patients:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Total Revenue from Patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Total Cost to the Hospital:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

5. **Calculate the Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Miles walked on Monday:**
   - Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.

2. **Miles walked on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, Walt walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, he walked \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

3. **Total miles from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - The total distance Walt walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

4. **Miles walked on Wednesday:**
   - To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday.
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday: \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.
   - Therefore, the miles walked on Wednesday: \( 41 - 28 = 13 \) miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is 700. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you figure out how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service on the first day.

To calculate the total earnings, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - 5 people each had 2 tires inflated.
   - Total bicycle tires: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - 3 people each had 3 tires inflated.

"Let's solve this step by step, keeping track of the number of fries at each stage.

1. **Dave's Initial Consumption:**
   - Dave ate 14 fries.
   - Remaining fries: \( x - 14 \)

2. **Seagull's Consumption:**
   - The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
   - Remaining fries: \( (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21 \)

3. **Pigeons' Consumption:**
   - Three pigeons each ate 3 fries.
   - Total fries eaten by pigeons: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \)
   - Remaining fries: \( (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30 \)

4. **Raccoon's Consumption:**
   - The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   - Fries taken by the raccoon: \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \)
   - Remaining fries after the raccoon: \( (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \)

5. **Ants' Consumption:**
   - Ants carried off one fry.
   - Remaining fries: \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \)

6. **Final Count:**
   - Five fries were left.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \)

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x - 30 = 18
\]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[
x = 48

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is:
  \[
  3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is:
  \[
  2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours per week}

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end.

First, let's convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet:

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

- Each croissant is 6 inches long. Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

- Each baguette is already given in feet, at 2 feet long.
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Now, let's add up the total lengths:

- Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
- Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, I'll multiply the monthly total by 2:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, let's break down the distances each person covers.

**Blake's Distance:**
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards (100 yards there + 100 yards back).
- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there + 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
- Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards.
- Difference: \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

The winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We need to find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means each increase is a multiplication by 1.20 (since 20% is 0.20, and 1 + 0.20 = 1.20).

3. **Number of Increases:**
   - Over 36 months, the number of two-month periods is 36 / 2 = 18.

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
     \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let's denote:
- Seth's current age as \( S \)
- Brooke's current age as \( B \)

From the first piece of information, we have:
\[ S = 2B \]

From the second piece of information, we know that in 2 years:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine How Much More Likely It Is to Roll a Number Greater Than 3
To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

### Final Answer:

\[ \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces/hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the straw for the rabbits:
\[ \text{Straw for rabbits} = 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's express the straw for the rats in terms of \( r \):
\[ \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces/rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

Using the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost per bag:**
   - The trader buys each bag of wheat for $20.
   - The transportation cost for each bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
     \[
     20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the profit per bag:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - The profit per bag is the selling price minus the total cost:
     \[
     30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of bags sold:**
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - The profit per bag is $8.
   - The number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:
     \[
     \frac{400}{8} = 50
     \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Cost of the tickets**: The three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair.
2. **Cost of the food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost of the food is:
   \[
   20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
   \]
3. **Cost of the rides**: They went on 2 different rides, and each ride costs $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
   \[
   33 \times 2 = 66
   \]

Next, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[
20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102
\]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[
102 \div 3 = 34
\]

Therefore, each of them paid:

"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly insect requirement for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement by dividing by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual Changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. This results in a net increase of:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of Trees After 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees That Die After 10 Years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final Number of Trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Thus, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on Sue's front yard.
   - Pink flamingos left: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - White flamingos added: 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - Pink flamingos now: \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - White flamingos remain: 6.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To figure out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, let's break down the costs and her earnings step by step.

First, we calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is:
  \[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket and the shoes:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how much Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
  \[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool, and \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons leaked out).
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 4S
   \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
\[
4S - 2S = 32 - 16

Janeth borrowed $2000 and agreed to return it with an additional 10% interest. First, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay back.

1. Calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

2. Calculate the total amount to be paid back:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to determine how much she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month.

3. Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months:
\[ \text{Total Paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we need to find the remaining balance after 12 months.

4. Calculate the remaining balance:
\[ \text{Remaining Balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

"Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian and Zack:
- Adrian's age: \( 3 \times 21 = 63 \) years.
- Zack's age: \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \) years.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \) years.
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \) years.
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \) years.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Naomi's Score**: We know that Naomi scored 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score. Half of Naomi's score is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Therefore, Yuri's score is \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. **Brianna's Score**: Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Next, we need to find the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem.

To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to first determine the number of petunias he plants. According to the problem, Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. 

Given:
- Number of geraniums = 90
- Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40

Let's calculate the number of petunias:
Number of petunias = 90 - 40 = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:
Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50 = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140.

"James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards initially. After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the new counts are:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Calculating the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- There are 4 snails in one aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in another aquarium.
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the stalls. There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many new cows each stall gets, we divide the 40 cows by the 20 stalls:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall will have the original 20 cows plus the 2 new cows:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

Given:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the first piece of information:

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

   \[
   \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weight loss rate:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we divide the total weight loss by her weekly weight loss rate:
   \[
   \text{Time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}

"Hello, I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate how much Theo can spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

First, let's break down Theo's expenses:
- He buys 6 business suits at $100 each: \(6 \times 100 = 600\) dollars.
- He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each: \(3 \times 50 = 150\) dollars.
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit: \(700 + (5 \times 100) = 700 + 500 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, let's add up these expenses:
- Total cost of suits and suitcases: \(600 + 150 = 750\) dollars.
- Total cost including the flight ticket: \(750 + 1200 = 1950\) dollars.

Theo has $6000 and wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he plans to spend is:
- Total amount to spend: \(6000 - 2000 = 4000\) dollars.

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- The total number of players on the football team is 105.
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense.

Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means 1/4 of 40 people, which is 10 people, left the party. 

If 22 men stayed at the party, we need to determine how many women are left. Since 10 people left, and the total number of people remaining is 30, we can calculate the number of women remaining as follows:

- Total remaining people: 30
- Men remaining: 22
- Women remaining: 30 - 22 = 8

So, the number of women left is 8.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}

3. **Add the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens as cows. We need to find out how many legs all the animals have together.

1. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \).
2. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60

6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:

- A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad.
- A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake.
- A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird.
- The container weighs 20 pounds.

First, let's determine the weights of the other animals:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the laundry math problem. Let's break it down:

Lindsay has 50 socks that need washing. She washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks. 

First, let's calculate the total number of socks she washes:
- 10 pairs of socks = 10 * 2 = 20 socks
- 15 loose socks = 15 socks

So, the total number of socks she washes is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10%, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's find the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

Total silver pesos:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Total gold pesos:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

"To solve the problem, let's start by understanding the information given:

Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and has 12.8 hectares left. This means that the remaining \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation to find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times \text{Total Land} = 12.8 \text{ hectares}
\]

To find the total land, we need to solve for the total land:

\[
\text{Total Land} = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the calculation:

\[
\text{Total Land} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32 \text{ hectares}
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. The choir has 52 members, and 50% of them are boys and 50% are girls. So, we calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

The performance is with just the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to determine how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine the energy savings, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the original daily energy consumption:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts of power.
   - It is used for 8 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new daily energy consumption after reducing usage:**
   - If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}

"To ensure everyone has a delicious meal during the big game, I'll calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese needed for the muffaletta sandwiches.

First, let's determine the number of sandwiches required:
- There are 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people.
- Number of sandwiches needed = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required:
- Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
- Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the cost:
- The meat costs $7.00 per pound.
- The cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
- Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
- Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total amount Tyson will spend:
- Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps in a day. Here's what we know:
- He completed half of his steps (5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
- He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can set up the following equation:

Total steps = Steps to and from school + Steps with friend + Steps during jog + Steps left

10,000 = 5,000 + 1,000 + Steps during jog + 2,000

Now, let's solve for the steps during the jog:

10,000 = 5,000 + 1,000 + Steps during jog + 2,000
10,000 = 8,000 + Steps during jog
Steps during jog = 10,000 - 8,000
Steps during jog = 2,000

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of words in the book:**
   - The book is 45 pages long.
   - Each page has an average of 200 words.
   - Total words = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words.

2. **Determine how long it will take Toby to read the book:**
   - Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.
   - Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time Toby has before he needs to be at the airport:**
   - Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.
   - It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.
   - Time available to read = 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

4. **Determine how many minutes early Toby will be:**
   - Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes.
   - Time left after reading = 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to break down the payments for each month and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 168000 \]"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Sally went to the seashore for vacation and her parents gave her $10 to spend. Let's break down her expenses:

1. **Taffy:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Mixed bag of seashells:**
   - Cost: $1.50.

3. **Magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for 4 magnets: 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all her expenses:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00
- Total expenses: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenses from $10:
- Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

So, the amount of money Sally has left is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total amount Tim spent on fireworks for the fourth of July.

First, let's break down the costs:
- The first package of fireworks costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it is \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
- The total cost of the first and second packages is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packages:
- The discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
- The discounted total for the first and second packages is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150:
- The total amount Tim spent is \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

So, Tim spent a total of 1110 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of candles that are expected to explode:**
   - Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are expected to explode.
   - The total number of candles is 50,000.
   - Therefore, the number of candles that are expected to explode is:
     \[
     0.01 \times 50000 = 500
     \]

2. **Determine the number of exploding candles that also smell like wet dog:**
   - We are told that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Therefore, the number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 500 = 25

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

For her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Certainly! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180.
- The total number of humps is 304.
- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of heads:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

To solve this system, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the elevation where the comb landed and then find out how much higher Oliver needs to climb to reach that point.

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's position, so the new elevation of the comb is:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver needs to climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   \[
   6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet}

   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made a total of $150 from selling his Pokémon cards.

He sells each card for $1.50. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:

\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \times C \right) \times 1.50 \]

We know this amount is $150, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \left( \frac{2}{3} \times C \right) \times 1.50 = 150 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times C \times 1.50 = 150 \]

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times C \times 1.50 = 150 \]

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times C = \frac{150}{1.50} \]

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times C = 100 \]

To solve for \( C \):

\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]

\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. So, for 18 guests (half of 36), he prepared \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hot dogs.
   - For the remaining 18 guests, he prepared 1 hot dog each, so \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hot dogs.
   - In total, he prepared \(36 + 18 = 54\) hot dogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hot dog.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is \(80 - 54 = 26\) hot dogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is \(26\) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Ray had 25 lollipops in total. He decided to keep 5 lollipops for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

Ray then shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's drive time from his hotel to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's drive time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's drive time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave compared to Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive time is 4 minutes).
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- The area of the room is 360 square feet.
- The length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) feet.

Now, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's start with the initial temperature of the house, which is 40 degrees. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and each hour the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. So, the temperature increase due to baking is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the total cooling is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting the total cooling from the temperature after baking:

4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

Let's start with the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:
\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards per deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards per box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the total number of basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:
\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student receives 10 cards, the number of students is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards per student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students Miss Maria has is:

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- Total cost before discount: \( 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount.
- Total cost after discount: \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for Kelly:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the laundry calculation for the hotel. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of item for 80 rooms:

- **Total sheets**: \(2 \text{ sheets/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 160 \text{ sheets}\)
- **Total comforters**: \(1 \text{ comforter/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 80 \text{ comforters}\)
- **Total pillow cases**: \(4 \text{ pillow cases/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 320 \text{ pillow cases}\)
- **Total towels**: \(8 \text{ towels/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 640 \text{ towels}\)

Finally, we add up all the pieces of laundry:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of carrot sticks} + 2 \]

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. The equation becomes:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To find \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, as the shark's length is given in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, the total length of the remoras is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to determine the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

1. First, let's add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
   - Kids allergic to dairy: 9
   - Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
   - Total: 9 + 6 = 15

2. Since 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, they have been counted twice in the total of 15. We need to subtract these 3 kids to avoid double-counting:
   - Adjusted total: 15 - 3 = 12

3. Now, we know that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
   - Total kids in the class: 32
   - Kids not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total cost of Paul's car rides over the 14 days.

First, let's break down the costs:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for 14 days.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of ride:
- Total cost for morning rides: $6 per ride * 14 days = $84.
- Total cost for afternoon rides: $2 per ride * 14 days = $28.

Next, we add the costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = $84 (morning) + $28 (afternoon) = $112.

So, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes, and each box contains ten oranges:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges they have together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To determine how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Each pie requires three oranges:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the number of Greek orange pies they can make is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, let's set up the equations for the total cost at each venue and solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We are given:
1. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found.
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found.
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the knitting yarn problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. To find out how much yarn they used together, we need to add these fractions.

First, let's convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4 to make the addition easier:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 364 yards is.

To do this, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

Suzie bought four packs of gum:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- 1 pack of grape gum, which cost $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so $1.

The total cost of all the gum was $7. We need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's set up the equation:
- Let \( S \) be the cost of one pack of strawberry gum.
- The total cost is the sum of the costs of all the packs: \( 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \).

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend on wood.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To maximize the number of sticks, Frederick should buy the type of wood that provides the most sticks per dollar. However, since the question asks for the most sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, we will focus on the 2 x 4 pieces.

4. **Calculating the Number of 2 x 4 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

Now, let's calculate the number of cows and sheep at each location:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Next, let's find the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Total animals on the farm: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- Total animals in the zoo: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

Finally, let's add the totals together to get the combined number of animals:

"Hello, I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Sophia and Rose went to the market to buy onions and potatoes. According to the information, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
2. Let \( y \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we have:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Now, we solve these equations:

For onions:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ 4y = 4 \]
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} \]
\[ y = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of one person:**
   - If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

2. **Convert days to hours:**
   - Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take one person to paint a whole house is:
     \[
     10 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 240 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time for 5 people:**
   - If 5 people are working together, the total time required to paint the house would be divided by 5. Therefore, the time it would take 5 people to paint a whole house is:
     \[
     240 \text{ hours} \div 5 = 48 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

We are given the following information:
- Ophelia and Jenna live in the same apartment building.
- Each has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
- Ophelia has 20 sofas.

Let's define the variables:
- \( C_O \) is the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- \( C_J \) is the number of chairs Jenna has.
- \( S_J \) is the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S_O = C_O - 2 \)
2. \( C_J = 3C_O \)
3. \( S_J = C_J - 2 \)
4. \( S_O = 20 \)

First, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom bought a CD for $4.
2. The total amount Tom spent is $48.
3. To find the cost of the headphone set, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Cost of headphone set} = \$48 - \$4 = \$44
   \]

4. Now, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:
   \[
   \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\$44}{\$4} = 11
   \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here's the breakdown:

1. Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for most of the weeks.
2. He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
3. He spent 6 hours in one week.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks he followed his regular routine:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He spent 5 hours for 2 weeks, and 6 hours for 1 week, which accounts for 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he spent 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.

Now, calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he spent 5 hours each:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, calculate the total hours for the 1 week he spent 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, add all these hours together to get the total:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus. 

1. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off:
   - Remaining passengers: \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)

2. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus:
   - Number of people getting on: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - New total: \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)

3. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off:
   - Remaining passengers: \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)

4. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus:
   - Number of people getting on: \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   - New total: \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's break down the information given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the printer:
- The printer costs $1,100 (cost of the computer) - $400 = $700.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the 2 monitors. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total amount spent:
- Total cost of the computer and printer: $1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) = $1,800.
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 (total) - $1,800 (computer and printer) = $600.

Finally, to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To meet his monthly saving target of $1125, Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of April compared to the first half. Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Total days in April:** 30 days.
2. **First half of April:** 15 days.
3. **Second half of April:** 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, the total savings in the first half is \( 15x \).

In the second half, he saves twice as much each day, so the amount saved each day is \( 2x \). The total savings in the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know the total savings target is $1125, so:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

So, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"As a health enthusiast, I understand the importance of adhering to recommended guidelines. Octavia drinks half of the daily recommended 4 cups of coffee, which means she drinks 2 cups daily. Her husband, Juan, drinks 10 times the amount that Octavia drinks, so he consumes 10 * 2 = 20 cups of coffee daily. To align with the daily recommendation of 4 cups, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question about the pet shop. Let's break it down:

The pet shop has 6 cages of rodents. Out of these, 3 cages contain 10 hamsters each, and the other 3 cages contain 5 guinea pigs each. To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters:
- 3 cages × 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- 3 cages × 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's determine Susan's weight. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 \]
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find Bob's weight. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:

\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} \]
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's calculate the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Angle**: The angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid.

3. **Total Movement**: Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun is the sum of the initial angle and the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you figure out how much James spends on birthday candles for his two sons.

First, let's determine the ages of the two sons:
- The older son is 12 years old.
- The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

Next, we need to find out the total number of candles required:
- The older son needs 12 candles.
- The younger son needs 8 candles.
- Therefore, the total number of candles needed is \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Now, let's calculate the number of packs of candles required:
- Each pack contains 5 candles.
- The number of packs needed is \(\frac{20}{5} = 4\).

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
- Each pack costs $3.
- The total cost is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

So, James spends $12 on candles.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the information given and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert this reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \) pages per minute.
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches in total. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, and Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. Let's calculate how many sandwiches each of them ate and then determine how many are left.

First, we calculate the number of sandwiches Cody ate:
\[ \text{Cody's sandwiches} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sandwiches Trevor ate:
\[ \text{Trevor's sandwiches} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches they both ate to find the total number of sandwiches consumed:
\[ \text{Total sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:
\[ \text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. We need to find out how old his nephew is today.

Let's denote:
- Shiloh's current age as \( S = 44 \)
- His nephew's current age as \( N \)

In 7 years:
- Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \)
- His nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \)

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she received for each of the previous three teeth. Half of $1.00 is $0.50, so for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature when set to 450 degrees:

1. The actual temperature when set to 450 degrees is 468 degrees.
2. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
3. The percentage error is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to be 520 degrees, so:

\[
1.04x = 520

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her exercise session. 

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, and each hour she burns 500 calories.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running, and each hour she burns 600 calories.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. Therefore, we calculate the amount of water she needs to drink as follows:
- Water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 800 ml.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is an enormous jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. If the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, we need to determine how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Weight loss with Cheerios:**
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
     \[
     1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Weight gain with donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:
     \[
     1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - The difference in weight between the two options is the sum of the weight loss and the weight gain:
     \[
     8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, starting from an initial height of 4 feet and doubling its height each day.

Let's break it down step by step:

- **Day 0**: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1**: The beanstalk doubles in height, so it becomes \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.
- **Day 2**: The beanstalk doubles again, so it becomes \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet tall.
- **Day 3**: The beanstalk doubles once more, so it becomes \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, let's break down the costs and his earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many hours George needs to work:**
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Let's solve this step by step. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

The equation for the sum of the angles in the triangle is:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, the largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, so:

\[ \text{Pounds per hour for Ruiz} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours:

\[ \text{Pounds per hour for Marissa} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ \text{Total pounds for Ruiz} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ \text{Total pounds for Marissa} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To calculate Patrick's total earnings from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two periods and then sum the earnings.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- For four hours, the total earnings are \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- For two hours, the total earnings are \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

   - The total number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - The total number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

4. **Determine how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash, she will get twice the number of washes from the same bottle.

First, calculate the total number of washes with 1 pump per wash:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes} \]

Next, determine the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, convert dollars to cents:
\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - John received a total of $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - This means the funding per month for the initial period is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.

2. **Extended period:**
   - The total research time is 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months.
   - The extended period is 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.
   - For the extended period, the funding per month increased by 50%, so the new monthly funding is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.
   - The total cost for the extended period is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the extended period.
   - Total cost = $100,000 (initial 5 months) + $1,350,000 (extended 45 months) = $1,450,000.

"To determine how many more times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining plays for each DVD and then sum these values.

1. The first DVD has a total lifespan of 1000 plays. It has already been played 356 times.
   - Remaining plays for the first DVD: \( 1000 - 356 = 644 \)

2. The second DVD also has a total lifespan of 1000 plays. It has already been played 135 times.
   - Remaining plays for the second DVD: \( 1000 - 135 = 865 \)

3. To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining plays of both DVDs:
   - Total remaining plays: \( 644 + 865 = 1509 \)

Thus, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's break down the problem:

1. Jim has a 20-pack of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours during an 8-hour school day.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school.
4. He chews 1 piece after dinner.
5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day:

- The school day lasts 8 hours, and he chews 1 piece every 2 hours.
- So, he chews \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \).

Next, we add the pieces he chews on the way home and after dinner:

- On the way home: 1 piece
- After dinner: 1 piece

So, the total number of pieces he chews in a day is:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces} + 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's find out how many pieces of gum he has left after chewing:

\[ 20 \text{ pieces} - 6 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:

\[ \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow a few steps:

1. Convert the speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to kilobits per hour (kb/h).
2. Convert the speed from kilobits per hour to megabits per hour (Mb/h).

First, let's convert the speed from kb/s to kb/h:
- There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour).
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb/s, so in one hour, she can download \( 20 \, \text{kb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \).

Next, let's convert the speed from kb/h to Mb/h:
- Since 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb), we divide the total kilobits by 1000 to get the speed in megabits.
- \( 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \div 1000 = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \).

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"As a professional in the automotive sales industry, I can break down the calculation for you step by step to determine how much James made from his commission.

1. **Total Sales Amount:**
   James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000.
   \[
   \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total sales minus the total acquisition cost.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Cost**: Manny's Karate classes cost $60 in total.
2. **Total Classes**: There are 10 classes in total.
3. **Cost Per Class if All Attended**: If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars.

However, if Manny misses some classes, the cost per class will increase. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost before the voucher is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Clara had a voucher that gave her $2 off, so the final amount she paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price of each pomegranate increased to $30. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at this new price, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

After applying the discount, the final amount Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

To find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila, we subtract the amount Clara paid from the amount Sheila paid:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats are half the sales from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats are \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales for the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Total sales for the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Sum the total sales for both months:**
   - Total sales for both months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
   - Total sales for both months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour.

   Let's calculate the cost for each paid hour:
   - First hour: $15
   - Second hour: \(15 \times 2 = 30\)
   - Third hour: \(30 \times 2 = 60\)

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of the costs for the paid hours: \(15 + 30 + 60 = 105\)

Therefore, the total amount James paid is:

"To calculate the number of dozens of eggs Lori will need for her party, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   \text{Total deviled egg halves} = 3 \times 16 = 48
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of whole eggs required:**
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed for 48 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \text{Number of whole eggs} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{24}{12} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase cost and the ongoing monthly expenses for hanger rental and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Fuel Expenses**: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- **Monthly Maintenance Cost**: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- **Annual Maintenance Cost**: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- **Total Cost for the First Year**: $150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (annual maintenance) = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the time to mow the entire lawn in each mode:**
   - In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes.
   - In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.

2. **Calculate the time to mow half of the lawn in each mode:**
   - Half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
     \[
     \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Sum the times to find the total time to mow the lawn:**
   - Total time:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let's denote:
- The age of one twin as \( T \).
- The age of one triplet as \( R \).

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ T = R + 7 \]

From the second piece of information, we can write:
\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you figure out how much time John has to nap before dinner. Let's break it down:

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Adding these up, we get:
20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes of homework.

John has 3 hours before he needs to eat dinner. Converting this to minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has left to nap after finishing his homework, we subtract the total homework time from the time before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. First, we need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month.

1. Calculate the additional amount Neil saves each month:
   \[
   \text{Additional savings} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins}
   \]

2. Add this to Rong's monthly savings to find Neil's monthly savings:
   \[
   \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
   \]

3. Calculate Rong's total savings over ten years:
   \[
   \text{Rong's total savings} = 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
   \]

4. Calculate Neil's total savings over ten years:
   \[
   \text{Neil's total savings} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
   \]

Finally, add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:
   \[

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's break down the costs:
- The dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
  \[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The heartworm check can be expressed as:
\[ 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

   - Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.
   - Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.

3. **Total Days:**
   - We need to calculate the amount of candy left after two weeks, which is 14 days.

4. **Total Candy Consumed:**
   - Ginger's total consumption over 14 days:
     \[
     4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - Amy's total consumption over 14 days:
     \[
     3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces}
     \]

5. **Candy Left After 14 Days:**
   - Ginger's remaining candy:
     \[
     100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - Amy's remaining candy:
     \[
     100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces}
     \]

6. **Difference in Candy:**
   - The difference in the amount of candy between Amy and Ginger:
     \[
     58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces}
     \]

Therefore, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with Mr. Boarden's bathroom remodeling project. Let's calculate the number of mosaic tiles he will need.

First, we need to determine the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. The bathroom is 36 square feet, and he wants to cover two-thirds of it. 

To find two-thirds of 36 square feet:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of mosaic tiles required for this area. Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot.

To find the total number of tiles:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Cost of Picking Blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of Buying Blueberries at the Store:**
   - Cost per pound of blueberries at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost of buying = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Number of Pizzas and Slices:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - Total number of pizzas = 5.
   - Total number of slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices Eaten by Bryce and Two Friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices Eaten by the Remaining Two Friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's start by converting the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We can set up the following equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I work in the pet care industry, so I understand the ins and outs of pet grooming schedules. Let's break down Melissa's week to see how many animals she will groom each day.

Melissa has:
- 8 dogs to bathe
- 5 cats to clip nails for
- 3 birds to trim wings for
- 12 horses to brush

First, we need to find the total number of animals she needs to groom:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We are given that the total number of cases of shingles needed for three homes is 250. The first house needs half the number of cases as the second house, and the third house needs double the number of cases as the first house.

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as \( x \).

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases for all three houses is given by the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To calculate the total cost for Mike to replace his movie collection with digital versions, we need to break down the costs based on the different categories of movies he has.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**:
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - Cost of each series movie: \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the cost of a normal movie.
   - Cost of a normal movie: $10
   - Cost of each series movie: \( \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \) dollars
   - Total cost for series movies: \( 200 \times 1.67 = 333.33 \) dollars

3. **Remaining movies**:
   - Total remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \)
   - Cost of each older movie: $5
   - Total cost for older movies: \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars

4. **Newer movies**:
   - Number of newer movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)
   - Cost of each newer movie: $10
   - Total cost for newer movies: \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars

5. **Total cost**:
   - Total cost for series movies: $333.33
   - Total cost for older movies: $800
   - Total cost for newer movies: $2400
   - Total cost to replace all movies: \( 333.33 + 800 + 2400 = 3533.33 \) dollars

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking, and then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is \(4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - Their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Total distance = \(225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

2. **Ava's Scores:**
   - Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

3. **Calculate Emma's Score:**
   - Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5B \)
   - Points from timer: \( 30T \)
   - Total score for Emma: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)

4. **Calculate Ava's Score:**
   - Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
   - Points from timer: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)
   - Total score for Ava: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

5. **Find the Difference in Scores:**
   - Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
   - Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Usual Days:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white. He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. After adding these new fish to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To determine the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the ratio of these two numbers.

1. **Third Grade:**
   - Number of students: 500
   - Number of students who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Grade:**
   - Number of students: 100
   - Number of students who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Grade:**
   - Number of students: 400
   - Pass rate: Twice the fourth grade's pass rate
   - Fourth grade pass rate: 40/100 = 0.40
   - Fifth grade pass rate: 2 * 0.40 = 0.80
   - Number of students who passed: 0.80 * 400 = 320

4. **Total Number of Students:**
   - Total students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000

5. **Total Number of Students Who Passed:**
   - Total passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700

6. **Overall Pass Rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = Total passed / Total students = 700 / 1000 = 0.70 or 70%

"To determine the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed and then add the remaining tea.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students:
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. I'm Fatima, and I have a knack for numbers, so let's get to it!

Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. Over the week, he made $105. To find out how many branches he climbed in total, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, to find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches} \]

So, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores. The bag contains 35 marshmallows. Each s'more requires one marshmallow. Here's what we know:

- John makes 9 s'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 s'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
\[ 9 \text{ (John's s'mores)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean's s'mores)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and lost from the original number of marshmallows in the bag:
\[ 35 \text{ (original)} - 21 \text{ (used and lost)} = 14 \text{ marshmallows remaining} \]

Now, we need to determine how many s'mores each kid can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since there are 2 kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
\[ \frac{14 \text{ marshmallows}}{2 \text{ kids}} = 7 \text{ s'mores per kid} \]

So, each kid can have 7 s'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):**
   - Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
   - One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
   - One friend: 8 quarters

   Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

4. **Calculate the total amount of money spent:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Tanya makes a salt scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar. The ingredients are salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. The relationships between the amounts of these ingredients are as follows:
- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

"Let's solve this step by step. We know the total number of Magic Cards is 341. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

Since Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - \( 480 \) inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total distance Mason has traveled on his bike journey.

Mason is traveling at a speed of 8 miles per hour. He first travels for 4 hours, and then after a rest, he continues for another 6 hours. To find the total distance, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and then add them together.

1. For the first part of the journey:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part of the journey:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Adding the distances from both parts of the journey:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Kora made 20 dishes.
- Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
- Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.

First, let's find out how many dishes Rory made:
- Since Kora made 20 dishes, Rory made \( 20 + 20 = 40 \) dishes.

Next, let's find out how many dishes Jada made:
- Since Rory made 40 dishes, Jada made \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
- Kora: 20 dishes
- Rory: 40 dishes
- Jada: 80 dishes

Total number of dishes:
\[ 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:

"To figure out how much money I have in my purse, let's break down the information:

- The laptop costs $600.
- Trading in my old laptop reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
- I have been paid $150 for my part-time job.
- My mom is giving me $80.
- I still need $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money I have in my purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money I have is the sum of the money in my purse, the part-time job earnings, and the money from my mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, I have $120 in my purse.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam slices 3 large apples.
- So, the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam slices 5 small apples.
- So, the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, let's find the total number of slices from both large and small apples:
- Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples
- Total slices = \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we need to find out how many slices are left:
- Slices left = total slices - slices eaten
- Slices left = \(30 - 15 = 15\) slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"As a farmer, I understand the importance of managing livestock to meet production goals. If I currently have 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk a day, my total daily milk production is:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

To reach a production goal of 25 liters of milk a day, I need to determine the additional milk required:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ 10 \text{ liters/day} \div 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, I need 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

- The store has 40 white shirts.
- The store has 50 floral shirts.
- Half of the white shirts have collars.
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

Now, let's calculate the number of white shirts with no collars:
- Half of the 40 white shirts have collars, so \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts have collars.
- Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
- There are 20 floral shirts with buttons.
- Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Finally, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are compared to white shirts with no collars:
- Number of floral shirts with no buttons = 30
- Number of white shirts with no collars = 20

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate how much Paige raised for the fundraiser.

First, let's determine the total number of hours Paige baked:
- Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the total number of banana bread loaves baked:
- Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour.
- Over 5 hours, she baked \( 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \).

Now, let's find out the total number of slices from all the loaves:
- Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of slices is \( 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \).

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money raised by selling all the slices:
- Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50.
- The total amount of money raised is \( 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

So, the total amount of money Paige raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's break down the information given:
- George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic.
- There were 50 students at the picnic.
- Each student was given 10 burritos.
- George ate 20 burritos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we add the number of burritos George ate:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos (students)} + 20 \text{ burritos (George)} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of burritos used from the original number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos (ordered)} - 520 \text{ burritos (used)} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. **Total Cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total.

Now, we can calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (\text{Number of red cars} + \text{Number of green cars} + \text{Number of blue cars})
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
23

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We are given:
- The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote:
- The number of books Anne has as \( A \).
- The number of books Sofie has as \( S \).
- The number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. She also bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. To find the weight of the sweet potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, Daisy bought a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. To find the weight of the carrots, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total glasses sold**: 32
2. **Glasses sold by Julie**: 14

Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses, and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

\[ \text{Glasses sold by the boys} = 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total glasses sold by the boys by 2:

\[ \text{Glasses sold by each boy} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your grocery budgeting question. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - So, the cost per pack of apples is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs of all the items:

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for the original number of notebooks:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Hello, I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday.

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we first calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana, which means:

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their distances together:

\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each of them read:
- Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages
- Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read compared to Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup:**
   - The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Calculate the amount of soup used for dinner:**
   - Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl.
   - 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.
   - Therefore, 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) are equivalent to 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls.

3. **Calculate the remaining soup after dinner:**
   - The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup.
   - After dinner, the remaining soup is 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls.

4. **Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch:**
   - Calvin has two children.
   - The remaining 4 child bowls of soup can be divided among the two children.
   - Each child will get 4 / 2 = 2 bowls of soup for lunch.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total amount of material needed for the masks.

To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to break down the requirements for both small and large masks.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Breaking it down step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

Next, we divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average:

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to add up the total number of toys Sophie already had and then subtract this from the new total number of toys.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

First, we add these numbers together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie's total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls is 62.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys she had before from the new total:
62 - 48 = 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( L \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the given information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
2. At the start, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, and she kept 1 for herself.
3. Maria's mom then gave each of the 5 people 3 more water balloons.

Now, let's calculate the total number of water balloons:

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Each of the 4 friends received 2 balloons: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
   - Maria had 1 balloon for herself: \(1\) balloon.
   - Total initial balloons: \(8 + 1 = 9\) balloons.

2. **Additional Balloons from Mom:**
   - Maria's mom gave each of the 5 people 3 more balloons: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

3. **Total Balloons:**
   - Total initial balloons: \(9\)
   - Total additional balloons: \(15\)
   - Total balloons after mom's addition: \(9 + 15 = 24\)

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the yard sale problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people. Each person donates 5 boxes, so:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we add the 10 boxes of stuff that the charity group already has:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

"To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in their watermelon seed spitting contest, we need to calculate the total distance each of them spits and then find the average of these distances.

1. **Zoey's Total Distance:**
   - Zoey has 40 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 10 feet.
   - Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

2. **Sydney's Total Distance:**
   - Sydney has 35 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 12 feet.
   - Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

3. **Combined Total Distance:**
   - Combined total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
   - Combined total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

4. **Average Total Distance:**
   - To find the average, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (2).
   - Average total distance = Combined total distance / 2
   - Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet.

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For each additional hour beyond the initial 12 hours, the charge is 70 pesos.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Now, let's add this to the initial 12-hour cost:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours, we subtract the total cost of his stay from the 24-hour stay cost:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, let's break down the requirements for both the goats and the sheep.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

Therefore, Nate needs a total of 159 pounds of hay for his livestock.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spends on gas:
\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:
\[ \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns from selling newspapers, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the commission from the New York Times and the commission from the Wall Street Journal.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * 5 = $0.50.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies.
   - Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * 15 = $1.20.
   - Cayley sells 10 copies.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Certainly! Let's calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, given the initial conditions and the rate of patient admissions.

The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds. Initially, 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

During the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Adding these newly admitted patients to the initial number of occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

This means 6 emails are sent to family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. The remaining emails are:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:
\[ 1 \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Shawna's age. Given that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate his age as follows:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number, but she overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert. 

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \). According to the problem, Courtney's reported number is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.2x \]
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Since Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey, we can calculate the number of corn chips Collins received as follows:

\[ \text{Collins' corn chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is 225.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you with this calculation. 

To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total. 

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 400 \times 0.5 = 200 \]

Adding this to the original cost of the supplies gives us the total travel cost:

"Let's solve this problem step by step, using the information given:

1. **Total Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe:**
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
   where \( A \) is the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe, \( S \) is the number of Pokemon caught by Stan, and \( X \) is the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

2. **Relationship between Alex and Stan:**
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
   This means Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.

3. **Relationship between Stan and Adelwolfe:**
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]
   This means Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.

Now, let's substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) into the total equation:

\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):

\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]

Simplify:

\[
S = 160 - 13
\]

\[
S = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. Let's break down the journey step by step:

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

Greta wanted brownies for her birthday. She made a batch for herself, which was one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with half a dozen brownies. When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting. During the party, 1.5 dozen brownies were eaten. We need to find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Brownies:**
   - Greta made 1 dozen brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
   - She brought home 0.5 dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
   - Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

2. **Total Brownies:**
   - Adding all the brownies together: \(12 + 6 + 48 = 66\) brownies.

3. **Brownies Eaten:**
   - During the party, 1.5 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

4. **Brownies Left:**
   - Subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies: \(66 - 18 = 48\) brownies.

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"To calculate the number of wooden slats Robert will need for his fence, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the garden:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, the total number of wood slats required is:

- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
- She kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes.
- Each box contains 20 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we find out how many boxes she has left after giving some away:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

The number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes after keeping 1/4:

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

You started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses you can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses you can plant is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you figure out how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year.

First, let's calculate how much Jessica saves each month for her fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly income:

\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, let's determine how much she saves in a year:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Jessica saves $6,000.00 in a year.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00:

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how long it will take to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. So, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
\]

Since each batch takes 10 minutes to sauté, the total time required to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[
\text{Time to sauté} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we add the time required to peel and the time required to sauté to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on Low for 3 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on High for 4 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming Up for 2 Hours with No Air Conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) flights in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The number of remaining flights is \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break down the howl durations for each of the three little wolves:

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- The total age of the four children is 20.
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We have a family of 6 people, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon is to be divided such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
- For the 4 kids: \( 4x \)
- For the 2 adults: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the rate at which the power bank loses charge over time.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**

   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   - Janet makes $10 an hour from wages.
   - She also makes $15 an hour from tips.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. The prices of the fruits are as follows:
- Peaches and pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

- Cost of peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Cost of pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Cost of kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Cost of apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:

Total cost = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's determine the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. Anne had 15 packs and kept 2 for herself, so she gave away:

\[ 15 - 2 = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets are in these 13 packs. Each pack contains 60 pieces, so:

\[ 13 \times 60 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to divide these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%.

To find the future price, we use the formula for compound interest, which is also used for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Let's plug in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them equally into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these pictures were selfies and how many were portraits. We know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits.

For the selfies:
\[ \text{Total number of selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

For the portraits:
\[ \text{Total number of portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Finally, to find the total number of selfies and portraits combined:
\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures} \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for James to read 18 pages, given that he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes.

First, let's find the reading rate:
\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we use this rate to find out how long it takes to read 18 pages:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Certainly! Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Guests:**
   The hotel started with 100 guests.

2. **Early Checkouts:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late Checkouts:**
   15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}

4. **Afternoon Check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

5. **Evening Check-ins:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
- The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.
- Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
- She earned a total of $120 from the sales.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of large stuffed animals sold.
- \( 2x \) as the number of small stuffed animals sold (since she sold twice as many small ones).

The total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She then gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her. Let's calculate how much money she has left from her earnings.

First, we calculate the total earnings from the cookies:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 \text{ per cookie} = \$80 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from the cupcakes:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4 \text{ per cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, we add the earnings from the cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings to find out how much money Suzanne has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost. Let's break it down:

1. The first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3. This means the cost per sandwich is:
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. The second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6. This also means the cost per sandwich is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- The total amount is $1920.
- The second person takes $80 more than the first person.
- The third person takes twice what the second person takes.

Let's denote the amount the first person takes as \( x \).

Then:
- The second person takes \( x + 80 \).
- The third person takes \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount can be expressed as:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Total days = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. **Determine the fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - The team worked 3/8 of a day each day.

3. **Convert the fraction of a day to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Hours worked each day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

4. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - Total hours worked by the team = 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours.

5. **Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:**
   - Number of painters = 4.
   - Hours worked by each painter = 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:
- Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set.
- Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
- First set: \( x + 4 \)
- Second set: \( x \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} \)

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"Hello, I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The total number of books in the library is 50.
2. Half of the books are written in English, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
3. 10% of the books are written in German, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 50 \times 0.10 = 5
   \]
4. The remaining books are written in Spanish. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

1. **Weekly Laundry Calculation:**
   - For the twin beds: Greg needs to wash 4 twin sets of sheets each week. Since his machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he will need to do:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets}
     \]
   - For the king size bed: Greg needs to wash 1 king set of sheets each week. Since his machine can wash 1 king set at a time, he will need to do:

"Let's solve this step by step. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time for the meal was 98 minutes.

Let \( D \) be the time Donovan took to complete his part. Then Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \).

The total time for both parts is given by:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 15 roses:**
   - A dozen (12) roses cost $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 roses plus 3 additional roses.
   - The cost of 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost of 3 additional roses at $2 each is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost of 15 roses is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

2. **Determine the total amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five 5-dollar bills, so the total amount of money she has is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny receives:**
   - The change is the total amount of money she has minus the total cost of the roses.
   - The change is \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 4 quarters, 4 dollars is equal to \(4 \times 4 = 16\) quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach the total of 200 toothpicks required for the sculpture:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks needed to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

   So, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Towels Purchase:**
   The set of towels was on sale for 10% off its original price of $30.00. The discount amount is:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **New Balance:**
   Adding the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( T \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
2. According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
4. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means:
   \[
   \frac{T}{15} = 6
   \]
5. To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   T = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Division:**
   Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he needs to cut into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide the total length by 4:
   \[
   \text{Length of each initial part} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Further Division:**
   Each of these 25 cm parts must then be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 cm by 5:
   \[
   \text{Length of each final cut} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the school and then find out how many of them are girls.

Given that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of students (\( T \)):

\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's break it down step by step to find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June.

1. **Total Miles to Hike:** 9,300 miles
2. **Total Days in June:** 30 days
3. **Miles per Hike:** 125 miles
4. **Hikes per Day:** 2

First, let's calculate the total miles Soledad plans to hike each day:
\[
\text{Miles per day} = 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total miles she will hike in June with her current plan:
\[
\text{Total miles in June} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, let's determine how many more miles she needs to hike to reach her goal:
\[
\text{Additional miles needed} = 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles}
\]

Finally, let's calculate how many more miles per day she needs to hike to cover the additional miles:
\[
\text{Additional miles per day} = \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
\]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of that, and Paul wants a third of that. We need to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left.

First, let's calculate Pierre's share:
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ kg} = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, let's calculate Paul's share:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \text{ kg} = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, we add Pierre's and Paul's shares to find out how much they have taken together:
\[
\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the total amount of apples to find out how much Jacques will have left:
\[
\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}

   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   \[

- Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
- Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

### Step 2: Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk
- Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
- Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk
- Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
- Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

### Step 4: Calculate the total time for the entire walk
- Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
- Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
- Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Jane has been saving $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we can multiply the amount she saves each week by the number of weeks:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen marbles equal 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

where \( x \) is the number of marbles Bob currently has. Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's use the principle of heat transfer and mixing. We need to find the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, \( T_2 \), such that when mixed with the water from the first mug, the final temperature \( T_f \) is at least 40 degrees.

Given:
- The temperature of the water in the first mug, \( T_1 \), is 33 degrees.
- The volume of water from the first mug, \( V_1 \), is 4 ounces.
- The volume of water from the second mug, \( V_2 \), is 1 ounce.
- The final temperature, \( T_f \), must be at least 40 degrees.

The formula for the final temperature when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{(V_1 \cdot T_1) + (V_2 \cdot T_2)}{V_1 + V_2} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We need \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Initially, the farm has:
- 50 cows
- 20 chickens

Each day, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens. This continues for 21 days (3 weeks).

First, let's calculate the total number of cows added over 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of chickens added over 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add these to the initial numbers:
- Total cows after 21 days:
\[ 50 \text{ initial cows} + 420 \text{ added cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

- Total chickens after 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ initial chickens} + 210 \text{ added chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without the discount:**
   Each pack of bagels costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs.
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00
   \]

2. **Apply the 10% discount:**
   The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   Subtract the discount from the total cost.
   \[
   \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of bagels:**
   Each pack contains 9 bagels, and Russell is ordering 4 packs.
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost per bagel:**
   Divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels.
   \[
   \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel}

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - For 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\).

2. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - For the next 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\).

3. Add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days:
   - Total eggs = \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\).

4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of dozens is \(\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}\).

First, let's break down the information given:
- Faraday sells individual sunflowers for $2 each.
- Faraday sells bouquets of sunflowers for $8 each, and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.

Now, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Number of individual sunflowers sold per day = \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Number of bouquets sold per day = \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Now, let's determine the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:
- Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = individual sunflowers + sunflowers in bouquets
- Total sunflowers sold per day = \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

Finally, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
- Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \).

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
2. He goes out three times a day.
3. Therefore, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/out} \times 3 \text{ outs/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]
4. To find out how many masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this Easter egg hunt problem.

First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid:
- Cole hid 3 dozen eggs.
- 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
- Therefore, 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Next, let's calculate how many eggs each participant found:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar: 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy: 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie: 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found:
- Total found = Lamar's eggs + Stacy's eggs + Charlie's eggs + Mei's eggs
- Total found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find out how many are still hidden:
- Eggs still hidden = Total hidden - Total found
- Eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate how much money John makes in a week from collecting garbage.

First, let's determine the number of apartments in each complex:
- The first two complexes each have 200 apartments.
- The third complex is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two complexes.

The combined total of the first two complexes is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% larger than 400 apartments:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 3120 \text{ collections/week} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his total earnings per week are:
\[ 3120 \text{ collections/week} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, John makes:
\[ 1248 \]"
"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]
8. Now, the length of the red rope is:
   \[
   4B = 4 \times 5 = 20

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation for Rissa's remaining money:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money, which is \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \) dollars.

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The mural is half yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

2. The remaining half of the mural is divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints. Therefore, the total amount of paint for these three colors is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, each color uses:

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of goals scored in the match.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)

First, let's break down the information given:
- There are 12 boys and 12 girls in Miss Albert's class.
- One-third of the girls are on varsity.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.

Now, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity:
- One-third of 12 girls is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) girls.

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity:
- One-fourth of 12 boys is \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) boys.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we can expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, let's break down the usage and orders over the three days:

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the calculation for May's haircut and color.

To determine the total cost, we need to consider both the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut. The cost of the hair color is a flat rate of $40. For the haircut, the cost is $30 per inch of hair cut off.

May's hair was initially 10 inches long and was cut down to 8 inches. The length of hair cut off is:
\[ 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut to find the total cost:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of May's cut and color is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack contains 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

2. She also bought twice the number of black pens as red pens. Therefore, the number of packs of black pens is:

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we calculate the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we determine the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the total amount John spends on everything:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of scotch} + \text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To calculate the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, let's break down the information:

- On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(20 \times 2 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total for the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than the 40 he planted on the first day. This means he planted an additional \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\) Lodgepole Pine trees, making the total for the second day \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's sum up the totals:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Adding these together gives the total number of trees planted:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He makes a cut to create two pieces, with the longer piece being 4 times the length of the shorter piece. We need to find the length of the longer piece.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To make 80 meatballs, we need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will use, and then calculate the amount of his secret steakhouse seasoning based on that.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. So, to find out how many pounds he needs for 80 meatballs, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:
\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the total amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, we need to find out how many cupcakes Carly made.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
- Let \( b \) be the number of brownies.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( b = 3c - 2 \) (Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes).
2. The total number of treats is 10 (since there are 5 people and each gets 2 treats).

We can set up the equation for the total number of treats:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. This means:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 12
   \]
   Substituting the number of Samantha's paintings:
   \[
   27 = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 12
   \]
   Solving for Shelley's paintings:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]

3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. This means:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Kim's paintings} + 8
   \]
   Substituting the number of Shelley's paintings:
   \[
   39 = \text{Kim's paintings} + 8

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - So, the price in December was $72.

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36
     \]
   - So, the price in January was $36.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate Rose's profit from selling the eggs.

First, let's determine the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. 

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's find out how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs:

Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn from selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. 

Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Total earnings = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes in total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
   \[ B = 5S - 4 \]

2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   \[ S + B = 116 \]

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the first equation:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

"To solve the Rubik's cube, let's break down the time taken for each side:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To determine how many calls Tim handles during his 5-day work week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of hours Tim works in a week:**
   - Tim works 6 hours each day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

2. **Convert the total hours into minutes:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   \[
   30 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

3. **Determine how many 15-minute calls he can handle in that time:**
   - Each call takes 15 minutes.
   \[
   \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls/week}
   \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the calculation for Crista's plants' water needs.

Crista has 20 plants in total. Let's break down the water requirements:

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - 4 plants each need 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - 8 plants each need 1 cup of water.
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel 200 yards, with half the distance on land and the other half in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
3. **Distance in Water**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time for each segment:

- **Time on Land**:
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**:
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, let's break down the popping rates of the popcorn kernels over the four 30-second intervals and the additional popping after the heat is turned off.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the following 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, so \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up all the kernels that popped:

- Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.

Next, we need to determine how many additional hot dogs John needs to buy:
- John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.
- Additional hot dogs needed = Total hot dogs needed - Hot dogs already available
- Additional hot dogs needed = 40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs.

Now, let's figure out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy:
- Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
- Number of packs needed = Additional hot dogs needed / Hot dogs per pack
- Number of packs needed = 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the packs of hot dogs:
- Each pack costs $2.
- Total cost = Number of packs needed * Cost per pack
- Total cost = 6 packs * $2/pack = $12.

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"As Fatima, I understand the importance of efficient distribution in times of crisis. Mamou has taken on a crucial role in providing meals to families affected by the floods. She started with 1,360 meals and has distributed 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. To find out how many meals are left, we need to subtract the total number of meals given out from the initial amount.

The total number of meals distributed so far is:
64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Subtracting this from the initial number of meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

"In a family with 2 brothers and 3 sisters, where all the sisters are 16 years old, and one of the brothers is 12 years old (which is half the age of the older brother), we can calculate the total age of all the siblings as follows:

1. Each sister is 16 years old, and there are 3 sisters, so the total age of the sisters is \( 16 \times 3 = 48 \) years.
2. One brother is 12 years old, and the older brother is twice his age, so the older brother is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) years old.
3. The total age of the brothers is \( 12 + 24 = 36 \) years.

Adding the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers gives us:

"To solve this problem, let's start by calculating the number of seeds in a small sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, the number of seeds in a small sunflower is:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \]

Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:

Dr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant, Igor, were preparing for a laboratory experiment. Dr. Grumpus requested:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

However, Igor made some mistakes:
- He gathered half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
- He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
- He picked up the correct number of beakers but lost some on the way to the lab bench

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. We need to find out how many beakers Igor lost.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]

Given:
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
- Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, let's determine how far Aaron ran:
- Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron must have run half of that distance.
- Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

Next, let's find Aaron's speed:
- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- So, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, let's determine Vanessa's speed:
- Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
- Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

Finally, let's calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the peeling rate for Ana:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Ana can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Determine the peeling rate for Jane:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Jane can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you calculate the total cost for Mark's car repair.

First, let's determine the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. 

To find the discount amount:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the price Mark pays for the radiator is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The total labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70. We need to find out how many of the animals are chickens.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
1. The total number of animals: \( c + k = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Henry and his 3 friends have ordered 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to:

1. Calculate the total number of slices.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices:
\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (4 people):
\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices.
