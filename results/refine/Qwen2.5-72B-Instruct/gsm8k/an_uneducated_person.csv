"Well, let's see. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 more for baking. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself. 

That leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell. If she sells each egg for $2, then she makes 9 * 2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"Well, let's see. A robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber, and it needs half that much white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so it needs 1 bolt of white fiber. 

So, if you add the blue and white fiber together, it's 2 bolts of blue plus 1 bolt of white, which makes 3 bolts in total.

"Well, let's see. Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. So, he put in a total of $130,000. The repairs made the house worth 150% more than what he bought it for. That means the house is now worth $80,000 plus 150% of $80,000.

150% of $80,000 is $120,000. So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000, which is $200,000.

To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract what he put in from what the house is now worth:
$200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

70000"
"Well, let's see. James runs 3 sprints each time, and he does that 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. So, if you do the math, it's 3 sprints times 60 meters, and then you do that 3 times a week. That's 540 meters a week.

540"
"Well, let's see. Wendi's got 20 chickens, and each one needs 3 cups of feed a day. So, for all of 'em, that's 20 chickens times 3 cups, which is 60 cups of feed for the whole day.

Now, in the morning, she gives 'em 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 'em 25 cups. So, that's 15 cups plus 25 cups, which is 40 cups already given.

To find out how much more she needs to give, we take the total for the day, which is 60 cups, and subtract what she's already given, which is 40 cups. So, 60 cups minus 40 cups is 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The store sells one glass for $5, and every second glass costs only 60% of that, which is $3.

So, for every two glasses, Kylar pays:
- $5 for the first glass
- $3 for the second glass

That's $8 for every two glasses.

Now, Kylar wants 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs of glasses. So, we need to multiply the cost of one pair by 8:
- $8 per pair
- 8 pairs

So, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Kylar needs to pay $64.

64"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep. That's easy enough.

Next, it says Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep} \]

Then, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, if Charleston has 80 sheep, then Toulouse has:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we need to add up all the sheep from the three places:
\[ 20 \text{ (Seattle)} + 80 \text{ (Charleston)} + 160 \text{ (Toulouse)} = 260 \text{ sheep} \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
260"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Carla is trying to download a big file, 200 GB. Normally, she can download 2 GB every minute. But after she downloads 40% of the file, her computer needs to restart for updates, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, she has to start the download all over again.

First, let's figure out how much she downloads before the restart:
40% of 200 GB is 80 GB.

Now, how long does it take to download 80 GB at 2 GB per minute?
80 GB รท 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Then, the computer restarts, which takes 20 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the whole 200 GB file again. How long does that take?
200 GB รท 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

So, the total time is:
40 minutes (first part of the download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (full download again) = 160 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is:
160"
"Well, let's see. John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles an hour, so he goes 180 miles away from home. Then he turns around and tries to get back home in 4 hours. 

For the first 2 hours, he's stuck in traffic, so he doesn't move at all. Then he drives for half an hour at 30 miles an hour, which is 15 miles. After that, he drives for the rest of the time, which is 1.5 hours, at 80 miles an hour, which is 120 miles.

So, he covers 15 miles plus 120 miles, which is 135 miles, on his way back home. 

He was 180 miles away, and he came back 135 miles, so he's still 45 miles away from home.

"Well, let's see. Eliza gets $10 for each hour she works, but if she works more than 40 hours, she gets extra money for those extra hours. She worked 45 hours this week, so she worked 5 hours more than 40.

For the first 40 hours, she gets:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the extra 5 hours, she gets 1.2 times her regular pay, which is:
$10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

So, her total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

460"
"Well, let's see. In the first month, the program got 60 downloads. That's a good start!

In the second month, it got three times as many as the first month. So, that's 60 times 3, which is 180 downloads. Wow, that's a lot more!

But in the third month, it went down by 30%. To figure out 30% of 180, you take 180 and move the decimal point one place to the left to get 18, then multiply by 3 to get 54. So, 180 minus 54 is 126 downloads.

Now, to find the total, you add up all the downloads: 60 from the first month, 180 from the second month, and 126 from the third month. That's 60 + 180 + 126, which equals 366.

So, the program had 366 downloads in total over the three months.

366"
"Well, lemme see if I can figure this out. Toula bought a bunch of yummy treats from the bakery. She got 3 dozen donuts, 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes. Now, let's break it down:

- For the donuts, she bought 3 dozen, and each dozen costs $68. So, 3 times 68 is 204 dollars.
- For the mini cupcakes, she bought 2 dozen, and each dozen costs $80. So, 2 times 80 is 160 dollars.
- For the mini cheesecakes, she bought 6 dozen, and each dozen costs $55. So, 6 times 55 is 330 dollars.

Now, we add all these up:
204 + 160 + 330 = 694 dollars.

So, the total cost is 694 dollars.

694"
"Well, let's see. Carlos is planting a lemon tree, and it costs him $90 to get it started. Each year, the tree gives him 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. But, he also has to spend $3 each year to keep the tree watered and fed.

So, every year, he makes 7 lemons times $1.5, which is $10.5. After he pays $3 for water and feed, he's left with $10.5 minus $3, which is $7.5.

To figure out how many years it'll take for him to make back the $90 he spent at the start, we divide $90 by $7.5. That's 12 years.

So, it'll take 12 years for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree.

12"
"Well, let's see. I heard a story 'bout a gal named Melanie who sells vacuum cleaners door to door. She went to three houses and ended up with 5 vacuum cleaners left. Here's how it went:

1. At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners.
2. At the red house, she sold 2 more.
3. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left.

Now, if she has 5 left, we need to work backwards to figure out how many she started with.

First, let's think about the orange house. She had some vacuum cleaners left after the red house, and she sold half of them at the orange house. So, the 5 she has left must be the other half. That means she had 10 vacuum cleaners before she went to the orange house.

Next, let's think about the red house. She had 10 vacuum cleaners before the orange house, and she sold 2 at the red house. So, before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

Finally, let's think about the green house. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, and she had 12 left after that. If 12 is two-thirds of what she started with, then the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with must be 12 * 3 / 2 = 18.

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

In the dance class, there are 20 students. 

- 20% of the students are in contemporary dance. That's 4 students.
- After taking out the 4 students in contemporary dance, there are 16 students left.
- 25% of these 16 students are in jazz dance. That's 4 more students.
- So, the rest of the students, which is 12, are in hip-hop dance.

To find out what percentage 12 students are of the total 20 students, we do this:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the students are in hip-hop dance.

60%"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about fancy business stuff.

So, the merchant has two choices:
1. Buy jewelry worth $5,000.
2. Buy electronic gadgets worth $8,000.

The financial advisor says:
- The jewelry market will go up by 2.5%.
- The electronic gadgets market will go up by 1.2%.

To figure out which one will make more money, we need to calculate how much each will be worth after the market goes up.

For the jewelry:
- 2.5% of $5,000 is \( 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \).
- So, the jewelry will be worth $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.
- The profit from the jewelry is $125.

For the electronic gadgets:
- 1.2% of $8,000 is \( 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \).
- So, the electronic gadgets will be worth $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.
- The profit from the electronic gadgets is $96.

So, if the merchant wants to make the most money, they should buy the jewelry because it will make $125 in profit, which is more than the $96 profit from the electronic gadgets.

The maximum profit is:
125"
"Well, let me think about this. The trains go 80 miles one way, and then they go 150 miles another way. So, if you add those two numbers together, that's how far they went in total. 

80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

So, each train went 230 miles in the two days.

230"
"Well, let's see. Jill makes $20 for each hour she teaches and $30 for each hour she coaches. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week teaching, and 15 hours a week coaching. 

First, we figure out how much she makes in a week from teaching:
35 hours times $20 is $700.

Then, we figure out how much she makes in a week from coaching:
15 hours times $30 is $450.

Now, we add those up to see how much she makes in a week total:
$700 plus $450 is $1150.

Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply her weekly earnings by 50 to get her yearly earnings:
$1150 times 50 is $57,500.

57500"
"Well, let's see. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. That's 3 eggs a day. There are 7 days in a week, so that's 3 eggs times 7 days, which is 21 eggs a week. Now, we need to know how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks. So, 21 eggs a week times 4 weeks is 84 eggs. 

Now, a dozen eggs is 12 eggs. So, to find out how many dozens 84 eggs is, we divide 84 by 12. That's 7. So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about walking and time.

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 more miles in another hour. So, she's walked 6 miles in 2 hours.

If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the whole 12 miles, she needs to finish the trail in 3 hours. She's already used up 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To figure out how fast she needs to walk, we just divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at 6 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, I have 10 liters of orange drink, and it's mostly waterโtwo-thirds of it. So, if I do the math, two-thirds of 10 liters is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters of water} \]

But I spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so now I only have 9 liters left. The water in those 9 liters is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters of water} \]

Next, I have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and it's also mostly waterโthree-fifths of it. So, three-fifths of 15 liters is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters of water} \]

Now, I mix the 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total amount of water in the mixture is:
\[ 6 \text{ liters (from orange drink)} + 9 \text{ liters (from pineapple drink)} = 15 \text{ liters of water} \]

So, the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Well, let's see. If Samantha is 31 now, and Raymond is 6 years older, that means Raymond is 37. Raymond had his son when he was 23. So, if we take 37 and subtract 23, that gives us 14. So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

14"
"Well, let's see. Billy had 8 customers today. The first 3 bought one DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs. Then, the next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 4 more DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy anything. So, if we add it all up, Billy sold 3 plus 4, which is 7 DVDs.

"Well, let's see. If the candle goes down 2 centimeters every hour, and it burns from 1 to 5, that's 4 hours. So, 2 centimeters times 4 hours, that makes the candle 8 centimeters shorter.

"Well, let's see. Kyle got the book for $19.50, and that was after a 25% discount. So, the $19.50 is only 75% of the original price, right? To find out what the full price was, we need to figure out what 100% would be.

If 75% is $19.50, then 1% would be $19.50 divided by 75. That's $0.26. So, 100% would be $0.26 times 100, which is $26.00.

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

26.00"
"Well, let's see. Marie bought a chicken meal for $12, 5 packs of milk for $3 each, and 4 apples for $1.50 each. She paid a total of $50. We need to figure out how many boxes of pizza she got, and each box costs $8.50.

First, let's add up what we know:
- Chicken meal: $12
- Milk: 5 packs at $3 each, so that's 5 times 3, which is $15
- Apples: 4 apples at $1.50 each, so that's 4 times 1.50, which is $6

Now, let's add these up:
- $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid $50 in total, so the money left for pizza is:
- $50 - $33 = $17

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the money left by the cost of one box:
- $17 รท $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Well, let's see. Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shorts costs $16.50, each pair of pants costs $22.50, and each pair of shoes costs $42.00.

First, we figure out how much the shorts cost:
3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each is 3 times 16.50, which is $49.50.

Next, the pants:
3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is 3 times 22.50, which is $67.50.

Then, the shoes:
3 pairs of shoes at $42.00 each is 3 times 42.00, which is $126.00.

Now, we add it all up:
$49.50 for the shorts, $67.50 for the pants, and $126.00 for the shoes. That's 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00, which equals $243.00.

So, Mishka spent $243.00 on all the clothing items.

"Well, let's see. Cynthia eats one scoop of ice cream every night. She gets a big container that has 15 scoops in it, and it costs her $4.00. 

If she eats one scoop a day, in 60 days she'll eat 60 scoops. 

Now, if one container has 15 scoops, she'll need:
\[ 60 \text{ scoops} \div 15 \text{ scoops per container} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

And if each container costs $4.00, then 4 containers will cost:
\[ 4 \text{ containers} \times 4 \text{ dollars per container} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Cynthia will spend 16 dollars on ice cream after 60 days.

"Well, let's see. Henry started his trip and went 20 miles before his first stop. Then, he stopped again 15 miles before the end of his 60-mile trip. So, he stopped at 45 miles. To find out how far he went between the stops, we just need to figure out the difference between 45 miles and 20 miles. 

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out.

Gloria is looking at some boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much as the first pair.

First, let's figure out how much the second pair of heels costs:
- The first pair costs $33.
- The second pair costs twice that, so it's $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add the costs of both pairs of heels:
- First pair: $33
- Second pair: $66
- Total cost of both pairs: $33 + $66 = $99

The problem says that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, if the total cost of the heels is $99, the boots must cost $5 more than that:
- Boots cost: $99 + $5 = $104

So, the boots cost $104.

104"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7 to 11. That means for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years. Together, their ages add up to 162.

To find out how many years each part of the ratio represents, we add 7 and 11 together:
7 + 11 = 18

Now, we know that 18 parts equal 162 years. To find out how many years one part is, we divide 162 by 18:
162 รท 18 = 9

So, each part of the ratio is 9 years. Now we can find out their ages:
- Darrell's age: 7 parts ร 9 years/part = 63 years
- Allen's age: 11 parts ร 9 years/part = 99 years

Now, to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years, we just add 10 to his current age:
99 + 10 = 109

So, Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years.

109"
"Well, let's see. The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans. The second friend says it's 20 more than half of 80, which is 40, so that makes 60. The third friend says it's 25% more than 80. Now, 25% of 80 is 20, so that makes 100.

To find the average, we add all these numbers together and divide by 3, because there are three guesses. So, 80 plus 60 plus 100 is 240. Now, 240 divided by 3 is 80.

So, the average guess is:
80"
"Well, let's see. John's got 10 dogs, and each one takes half an hour a day to walk and take care of. So, if you do the math, 10 dogs times half an hour each, that's 5 hours a day. Now, there are 7 days in a week, so 5 hours a day times 7 days is 35 hours a week. 

35"
"Well, let's see. Gretchen has 110 coins in total. It says there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we split the coins into two groups, one for gold and one for silver, and we know the gold group has 30 more coins, we can figure it out like this:

If we take away those extra 30 gold coins, we'd have an equal number of gold and silver coins. So, 110 coins minus 30 extra gold coins gives us 80 coins. These 80 coins are split equally between gold and silver, so that's 40 coins each.

But remember, we took out 30 gold coins to make them equal, so we need to add those back to the gold coins. So, 40 silver coins plus the 30 extra gold coins gives us 70 gold coins.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"Well, let's see. If Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's, that means Aaron has 20 plus 5, which is 25 jewels. Now, if Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, then she has 25 minus 2, which is 23 jewels.

23"
"Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.

To figure out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to find 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 is 1 point (because 25% is a quarter, and a quarter of 4 is 1).

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 points plus 1 point, which is 5 points.

Now, we add the points from both halves:
4 points + 5 points = 9 points

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"Well, let's see. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and they're sellin' 4 yogurts for $5. So, first, we gotta figure out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. That's 2 yogurts times 30 days, which is 60 yogurts.

Now, if 4 yogurts cost $5, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. That's 60 divided by 4, which is 15 sets.

Each set costs $5, so 15 sets would cost 15 times $5, which is $75.

So, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days.

"Well, let's see. John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half that time, so that's 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he runs in a week is:
3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Now, to find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total hours:
60 miles รท 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at 10 miles per hour.

10"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. Now, skipping is half as fast as running, so running must be twice as fast. That means Dana can run at 6 miles per hour.

Running is four times faster than walking, so walking must be a quarter of the running speed. That means Dana can walk at 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, in six hours, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. One-third of six hours is 2 hours, and two-thirds of six hours is 4 hours.

So, in 2 hours of running, she covers:
2 hours ร 6 miles per hour = 12 miles.

And in 4 hours of walking, she covers:
4 hours ร 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles.

Add those together, and she covers:
12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

18 miles."
"Well, let's see. If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, that means Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. Now, if Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, then Brandonโs iPhone is 8 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way. 

A bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag. So, the whole bag has 1250 calories.

You've already eaten 1800 calories today, and your goal is 2000 calories. So, you can eat 200 more calories.

Now, we need to figure out how many grams of chips 200 calories is. Each serving is 250 calories, and the whole bag is 300 grams. So, 250 calories is about 60 grams (since 300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams per serving).

If 250 calories is 60 grams, then 200 calories would be a bit less. We can do a quick calculation:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories}} \times 60 \text{ grams} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"Well, let's see. If Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, and he wants to make 20 candles, he'll need 2 pounds of beeswax. Each pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10, so 2 pounds will cost him $20. If he sells each candle for $2, then 20 candles will bring in $40. To find out how much he makes after costs, we take the $40 he makes and subtract the $20 he spent. So, Charlie's net profit is:

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Meredith is a blogger who writes about health stuff. She spends 4 hours on each article. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday.

First, let's figure out how many articles she wrote each day:

- **Monday:** She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote 2/5 more than Monday. So, 2/5 of 5 is 2. That means she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice as many as Tuesday. So, 7 times 2 is 14 articles.

Now, let's add up all the articles she wrote:

- Total articles: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4:

- Total hours: 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

So, Meredith spent 104 hours writing articles in the three days.

104"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then bought a package of Post-it notes, but we don't know how many were in the package yet. After that, she used 220 Post-it notes at work. At the end, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

First, let's figure out how many Post-it notes she had before she used any. She had 23 left over, and she used 220, so:

220 (used) + 23 (left) = 243 (total she had before using any)

Now, we know she started with 80 Post-it notes. So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought is:

243 (total she had) - 80 (she started with) = 163

So, the package she bought had 163 Post-it notes.

163"
"Well, let's see. John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, he bought:

\[
200 \div 40 = 5 \text{ blue ties}
\]

He buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So, each red tie costs:

\[
40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, the total cost for the red ties is:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount John spent on all the ties is:

\[
200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\boxed{800}

"Well, let's see. If Tracy had a piece of wire that was 4 feet long, and she cut it into pieces that were 6 inches each, we need to figure out how many pieces she got. 

First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is 4 times 12, which is 48 inches. 

Now, if each piece is 6 inches long, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. So, 48 inches divided by 6 inches per piece gives us 8 pieces.

"Well, let's see. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is:

15 floors ร 8 units/floor = 120 units

Now, 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:

120 units ร 3/4 = 90 units

To find the unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:

120 units - 90 units = 30 units

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
30"
"Well, let's see. Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs every day. That's a lot of eggs! Now, if we want to know how many eggs he gets in a week, we just multiply that by 7, 'cause there are 7 days in a week. So, 252 eggs times 7 days equals 1764 eggs in a week.

Now, he sells these eggs in dozens, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen. So, to find out how many dozens he has, we divide 1764 by 12. That gives us 147 dozens.

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. So, to find out how much he makes, we multiply the number of dozens by the price. That's 147 dozens times $2, which equals $294.

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"Well, let's see. Tom's ship goes 10 miles every hour, and he sails from 1 to 4 PM. That's 3 hours, so he goes 30 miles. When he comes back, his ship goes slower, only 6 miles every hour. To figure out how long it takes to come back, we divide the distance by the speed. So, 30 miles divided by 6 miles per hour equals 5 hours. 

5"
"Well, let's see. If Uriah takes out 30 comic books and each one of them weighs 1/4 pound, that means he's taking out 30 times 1/4 pounds. That's 7.5 pounds. He needs to take out 15 pounds in total, so he still needs to take out 15 minus 7.5, which is 7.5 pounds more.

Now, if each toy weighs 1/2 pound, to find out how many toys he needs to take out, we divide the weight he still needs to remove by the weight of each toy. So, 7.5 divided by 1/2 is 15. 

So, Uriah needs to take out 15 toys.

"Well, let's see. On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. For each truck tire, he charges $60, so for 6 truck tires, that's 6 times 60, which is 360 dollars. For each car tire, he charges $40, so for 4 car tires, that's 4 times 40, which is 160 dollars. So, on Thursday, he made 360 plus 160, which is 520 dollars.

On Friday, he only fixed car tires, 12 of them. So, 12 times 40 is 480 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more he made on the day he made the most, we need to see the difference between 520 and 480. That's 520 minus 480, which is 40 dollars.

So, the mechanic made 40 dollars more on Thursday.

"Well, let's see. The girls brought home 7 little kittens. Now, their momma says that Patchy, one of their cats, had three times as many as the ones they brought home. So, that's 3 times 7, which is 21 kittens. Then, Trixie, the other cat, had 12 kittens. 

So, we add 'em all up: 7 from the shelter, 21 from Patchy, and 12 from Trixie. That's 7 + 21 + 12.

Let's count: 7 + 21 is 28, and 28 + 12 is 40.

So, the family now has 40 kittens.

"Well, let's see. Peter's got 42 dollars, and he wants to go to the movies. Each time he goes, he spends 7 dollars on a ticket and 7 dollars on popcorn. That's 14 dollars for one visit. 

Now, if we take his 42 dollars and see how many times 14 goes into it, we can figure out how many times he can go. 

42 divided by 14 is 3.

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

"Okay, let's figure this out. The bridge can hold 5000 pounds. The truck and the driver together weigh 3755 pounds. So, we need to find out how much weight is left for the boxes.

First, we subtract the weight of the truck and driver from the bridge's limit:
5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes we can load, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box:
1245 pounds รท 15 pounds per box = 83 boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes we can load is 83.

"Okay, let's break it down simple-like.

Stephen's groceries cost $40.00. The delivery people added a 25% fee, which is like adding a quarter of the cost again. So, a quarter of $40.00 is $10.00. Now, add that to the $40.00, and you get $50.00.

Then, they added $3.00 for delivery, so that's $50.00 plus $3.00, which makes $53.00.

Stephen also gave a $4.00 tip, so add that to $53.00, and you get $57.00.

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:
57.00"
"Well, let's see. If there are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, that's like having 6 times 20, which is 120 fruits. Then, there are 67 more fruits just hanging around. So, if we add those 120 fruits and the 67 fruits together, we get 187 fruits in total.

187"
"Okay, let's figure this out. We got 25 oranges in the basket. One of 'em is bad, so we take that away. Then, 20% of the oranges are unripe. That means 5 oranges are unripe 'cause 20% of 25 is 5. We also got 2 sour oranges. So, we add up the bad, unripe, and sour oranges: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8. Now, we take the total number of oranges and subtract the bad, unripe, and sour ones: 25 - 8 = 17. So, there are 17 good oranges.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way. If Marcy works for 30 years, she gets a part of the full pension. The full pension is $50,000 a year, but she only gets a part of it because she didn't work the full 40 years.

For every year after 20 years, she gets 5% more of the full pension. So, if she works 30 years, that's 10 years after the 20-year mark.

10 years * 5% = 50%

So, she gets 50% of the full pension. 

50% of $50,000 is $25,000.

So, her annual pension will be $25,000.

$25,000"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Aleena pays $140 each month for the first 6 months. So, for the first half of the year, she pays:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half of the year, the price goes down by 10%. So, the new price is:
\[ 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars per month} \]

For the second half of the year, she pays:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount she paid for the whole year, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year is:

1596"
"Well, let's see. Sophia drove 100 miles and had to put 4 gallons of gas back in her car. That means her car goes 25 miles for every gallon of gas, 'cause 100 miles divided by 4 gallons is 25 miles per gallon.

Now, her car can hold 12 gallons of gas. If she can go 25 miles on one gallon, then on 12 gallons, she can go 25 miles times 12 gallons, which is 300 miles.

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a full tank of gas.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
2. Then he reads for half as long, which is 1 hour.
3. So, in one session, he spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading, which adds up to 3 hours.
4. He does this 3 times a week.
5. So, in one week, he spends 3 hours/session ร 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.
6. Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks.
7. In 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week ร 4 weeks = 36 hours.

So, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

"Well, let's see. Each school sends a girls' team and a boys' team, and each team has 5 players. That's 10 players per school. Then, each school also sends a coach for the girls' team and a coach for the boys' team, which is 2 more people. So, each school sends 12 people in total.

Now, there are 4 schools, so we need to multiply 12 by 4. 

12 times 4 is 48.

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48.

"Well, let's see here. The treasure chest has 175 diamonds. Now, it says there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so that means there are 175 - 35 = 140 rubies. Then, it says there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, so that's 2 * 140 = 280 emeralds. 

Now, to find out how many gems there are in total, we add 'em all up: 175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds = 595 gems.

So, there are 595 gems in the chest."
"Well, let's see. If there are 60 girls and twice as many boys, that means there are 120 boys. So, the total number of students is 60 girls plus 120 boys, which is 180 students.

"Well, let's see. Judy teaches 5 dance classes every weekday, and that's 5 days, so that's 5 classes times 5 days, which gives us 25 classes. On Saturday, she teaches 8 more classes. So, in one week, she teaches 25 plus 8, which is 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15 for each student. So, for each class, she makes 15 students times $15, which is $225.

Now, if she makes $225 for each class and she teaches 33 classes in a week, then she makes $225 times 33, which is $7425.

So, Judy makes $7425 in one week.

43 brownies times 3 dollars each is 129 dollars.

Next, we figure out how much he made from the cheesecakes:
23 slices times 4 dollars each is 92 dollars.

Now, we add 'em up:
129 dollars plus 92 dollars is 221 dollars.

So, Tommy raised 221 dollars.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way:

Shiela bought 5 cell phones, and each one costs $150. So, the total cost for the phones is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Now, there's a 2% interest on the total cost. To find the interest, we do:
\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay, including interest, is:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months. To find out how much she pays each month, we divide the total amount by 3:

- Begonias usually cost $2.12, but he's rounding that to $2.

Now, if he sells:
- 12 pots of marigolds at $3 each, that's 12 * 3 = $36.
- 9 pots of petunias at $2 each, that's 9 * 2 = $18.
- 17 pots of begonias at $2 each, that's 17 * 2 = $34.

"Well, let's see. Luke's sandcastle has 4 levels, and each level is half the size of the one below it. The top level, which is the 4th level, is 16 square feet. 

So, if the 4th level is 16 square feet, the 3rd level must be 32 square feet, because it's twice as big. The 2nd level is twice as big as the 3rd, so that's 64 square feet. And the 1st level, being twice as big as the 2nd, is 128 square feet.

Now, to find the average, we add up all the square feet and divide by the number of levels. So, 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet in total. 

There are 4 levels, so we divide 240 by 4, which gives us 60.

So, the average square footage of a level is:

"Well, let's see. For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of food each day. So, that's 180 cups of food. After that, for the rest of the year, which is 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups each day. That's 370 cups of food. 

Now, add those up: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups of food for the whole year.

Each bag has 110 cups of food. So, to find out how many bags we need, we divide 550 by 110.

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

- That would cost me 6 times $2.50, which is $15.

Now, if I buy them in packs of 2:
- I need 9 packs to get 18 flowers (18 divided by 2).

"Well, let's see. There were 24 liters of water to start with. Each of the two girls got 1/6 of it. So, each girl got 4 liters, because 24 divided by 6 is 4. Two girls means 4 liters times 2, which is 8 liters. Then, the boy got 6 liters. So, 8 liters for the girls plus 6 liters for the boy is 14 liters. 

If we started with 24 liters and 14 liters were taken, that leaves us with 10 liters of water.

"Okay, let's think about this. The team played 22 games, and they won 8 more games than they lost. 

If we say they lost \( L \) games, then they won \( L + 8 \) games. 

Now, the total number of games is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

This means:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost:
\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

They won 15 games.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Sylvie started with a monthly salary of $600. After 5 years, the company gives her a raise of 10% of her initial salary. 

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Raise**: 10% of $600 is $60 (because 10% of 600 is 60).
3. **New Monthly Salary**: $600 + $60 = $660
4. **New Annual Salary**: $660 per month times 12 months = $7,920

So, after 3 more years, her annual salary will still be $7,920 because the raise only happens once after 5 years.

So, \( 11H = 88,000 \).

To find \( H \), we divide 88,000 by 11:

16 friends ร 3/4 = 12 friends will show up.

Now, Christina needs 0.75 gift bags for each person she invited, not just the ones who show up. So, we need to figure out how many gift bags she needs for 16 friends:

16 friends ร 0.75 = 12 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2. So, to find out how much she will spend, we do this:

12 gift bags ร $2 per gift bag = $24.

So, if we add the 200 pounds for the grown-ups and the 25 pounds for the little ones, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"Well, let's see. Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so that's 6 pets for Marcia. Jan has three times as many as Marcia, so that's 18 pets for Jan. Now, if we add 'em all up: 4 for Cindy, 6 for Marcia, and 18 for Jan, that makes 28 pets in total.

28"
"Well, let's see. James is 10, and he's 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey must be 11. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 9. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 4.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about running.

Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. It says that Lee used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. So, if Lee is 38 seconds, Gerald must have been 40 seconds because 38 + 2 = 40.

Now, Gerald changed his diet and got 10% faster. If he was 10% faster, that means he can now run the same distance in 90% of the time it used to take him. So, we need to find 90% of 40 seconds.

To find 90% of 40, you multiply 40 by 0.90:
40 * 0.90 = 36

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

36"
"Well, let's see. If there are 60 dogs and for every dog, there are 2 cats, that means there are 120 cats. So, the dogs and cats together make 180 pets. Now, the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total of dogs and cats, so that's 180 - 12, which gives us 168 rabbits. 

To find out the total number of pets, we add the dogs, cats, and rabbits all together: 60 dogs + 120 cats + 168 rabbits. That's 348 pets in total.

348"
"Well, let's see. There are 200 students in Grade 5, and 2 out of every 5 students are boys. So, if we split 200 into 5 parts, each part is 40. That means there are 80 boys (2 parts).

Now, if there are 200 students and 80 are boys, then the rest must be girls. So, there are 120 girls.

Next, it says 2 out of every 3 girls are in the girl scout. So, if we split 120 into 3 parts, each part is 40. That means 80 girls (2 parts) are in the girl scout.

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is the remaining part, which is 40.

40"
"Well, let's see. Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only 2/3 of that. So, if you take 9 and cut it into 3 parts, each part is 3 hours. Two parts would be 6 hours. So, James slept 6 hours. 

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept, we just take Harry's 9 hours and subtract James' 6 hours. That's 3 hours.

3"
"Well, let's see. Freda makes sauce from canned tomatoes, and when she cooks 'em, they lose half their volume. So, if she ends up with 32 ounces of sauce, that means she started with twice that much in tomatoes, which is 64 ounces.

Each can of tomatoes has 16 ounces, and each can has three tomatoes. So, to get 64 ounces, she must have used:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can has 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes she used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just a regular person who's not too good with numbers.

We start with 30 cars on the motorway. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes, then 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes. Also, 5 cars take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.

So, if 5 cars took an exit, that means they're not part of the cars that drove through. We need to figure out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Let's say \( x \) is the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes. Then, the total number of cars that drove through is \( x + 20 \).

We know that the total number of cars that either drove through or took the exit is 30. So, we can write it like this:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"Well, let's see. Mary got 18 new potted plants. She already had 2 plants on each of her 40 window ledges. So, she had 2 times 40, which is 80 plants. Adding the 18 new ones, she had 80 plus 18, which is 98 plants.

Now, she's giving away 1 plant from each of the 40 ledges. That means she's giving away 40 plants. So, she'll have 98 minus 40, which is 58 plants left.

58"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed it 1/4 more than the first friend. So, 1/4 of 20 is 5. That means the second friend pressed it 20 + 5 = 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed it 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed it 10 more times than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed it 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add them all up:
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

So, the total number of doorbell rings is:
175"
"Well, let's see. Solo's got to read a bunch of pages from different books. He needs to read 4 pages from Science, 20 from Social Studies, 7 from History, and 8 from Geography. That's a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8, which is 39 pages.

He already read 15 pages on Monday, so he's got 39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read.

He's got 4 more days to finish, so he needs to read 24 pages divided by 4 days. That's 24 รท 4 = 6 pages each day.

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages a day for the next 4 days.

"Well, let's see. John drinks water 4 times a day from Monday to Friday, and only 3 times a day on Saturday and Sunday. 

So, for the weekdays, that's 4 glasses a day for 5 days, which is 20 glasses. On the weekend, he drinks 3 glasses a day for 2 days, which is 6 glasses.

Add 'em up: 20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses.

"Well, let's see. If the fog takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, and the city is 42 miles wide, we need to figure out how many 3-mile chunks there are in 42 miles. 

42 miles divided by 3 miles per chunk is 14 chunks. 

If each chunk takes 10 minutes, then 14 chunks will take 14 times 10 minutes. 

14 times 10 is 140 minutes.

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, Poppy puts down a quarter of the 1000 pieces. A quarter is the same as 1/4, so:

1000 รท 4 = 250 pieces

So, Poppy puts down 250 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left:

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

Next, Poppy's mom puts down a third of the remaining 750 pieces. A third is the same as 1/3, so:

750 รท 3 = 250 pieces

So, Poppy's mom puts down 250 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left:

750 - 250 = 500 pieces

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

500 pieces

"Well, let's see. John has 3 boxes, and each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches on the outside. But the walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to take that into account.

For each box:
- The inside length is 5 inches minus 2 inches (1 inch for each side), so it's 3 inches.
- The inside width is 6 inches minus 2 inches, so it's 4 inches.
- The inside height is 4 inches minus 2 inches, so it's 2 inches.

Now, to find the volume of one box, we multiply these inside dimensions:
- Volume of one box = 3 inches ร 4 inches ร 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
- Total volume = 24 cubic inches ร 3 = 72 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

On Monday, Frankie watched 1 hour of TV.
On Tuesday, he watched another 1 hour of TV.
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV.
On Friday, he watched 2 hours of TV.

So, let's add up what he watched from Monday to Friday, except for Wednesday:
1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Now, on Wednesday, he watched some 30-minute shows. Each 30-minute show is half an hour. So, to find out how many 30-minute shows he watched, we divide the total time he watched on Wednesday by 30 minutes:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per show = 3 shows

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"Well, let's see. Henry ended up with 110 cookies after he dropped 5. So, before he dropped them, he had 115 cookies. He said he baked 15 more than he planned, so he must have planned to bake 100 cookies. Since he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, that means last year he baked half of 100, which is 50 cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, the gas costs $3.00 a gallon. If you buy 10 gallons, you do the math:
\[ 3.00 \times 10 = 30.00 \]
So, the total cost before any cashback is $30.00.

Now, the app gives you $0.20 back for each gallon. For 10 gallons, you get:
\[ 0.20 \times 10 = 2.00 \]
So, you get $2.00 back.

To find out how much you actually pay, you subtract the cashback from the total cost:
\[ 30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00 \]

So, after the cashback, you pay $28.00.

"Well, let's see. Beatrice had a roll-up that was 2 wide and 24 long, so she ate 2 times 24, which is 48 roll-ups. Marcell had a roll-up that was 3 wide and 14 long, so he ate 3 times 14, which is 42 roll-ups. Together, they ate 48 plus 42, which is 90 roll-ups. To find out the average, you take the total, 90, and divide it by 2, because there are 2 people. So, 90 divided by 2 is 45.

"Well, let's see. Julia's boat was takin' on water, and she had to row back to shore. She took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we need to figure out how far she rowed in that time and how much water got in.

First, let's find out how far she rowed in 64 seconds. If 16 seconds is 20 feet, then 64 seconds is:
\[ 64 \div 16 = 4 \]
So, she rowed 4 times 20 feet:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, for every 10 feet she rowed, the boat took on 2 liters of water. So for 80 feet, the boat took on:
\[ 80 \div 10 = 8 \]
And 8 times 2 liters is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

   \[ 1800 \div 6 = 300 \]
   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photos.

3. The number of photos Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photo. So, if we divide 300 by 50, we get the number of ducks:

"Well, let's see. I got some leftover wood, and I want to figure out how much money I can make if I sell it. 

I got ten pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards, and I paid $10 each for them. So, that's:
10 boards * $10 = $100

I also got five pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards, and I paid $16 each for them. So, that's:
5 boards * $16 = $80

So, the total I paid for all the wood is:
$100 + $80 = $180

Now, the prices went up by 50%. So, the new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
$10 * 1.5 = $15 each

And the new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
$16 * 1.5 = $24 each

If I sell all the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, I'll get:
10 boards * $15 = $150

And if I sell all the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, I'll get:
5 boards * $24 = $120

So, the total money I'll make from selling all the wood is:
$150 + $120 = $270

To find out how much profit I make, I subtract what I paid from what I'll make:
$270 - $180 = $90

So, I'll make a profit of:

"Well, let's see. Katy makes her coffee with a special mix. For every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. That's a total of 20 parts (7 + 13).

Now, she used a total of 120 parts of sugar and water together. To find out how many parts each part is, we divide 120 by 20. That gives us 6.

So, for the sugar, we take the 7 parts and multiply by 6. That's 7 times 6, which equals 42.

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just a regular person who knows how to count.

1. On the first day, there were 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
   - 2 containers ร 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

2. The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that some more vehicles were added.

3. To find out how many more vehicles were added, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles after the second day:
   - 30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day).

4. Each container still has 5 vehicles. So, to find out how many containers were added on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:
   - 20 vehicles รท 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Four years ago, Adrien was making $40,000. That was 30% more than what Lylah was making. To find out what Lylah was making, we need to figure out what 100% of her salary would be if 130% is $40,000.

So, if 130% is $40,000, then 1% is $40,000 divided by 130, which is about $307.69. So, 100% of Lylah's salary is $307.69 times 100, which is about $30,769.23.

Now, four years later, Adrien's salary went up by 40%. So, we take his old salary of $40,000 and add 40% of it. That's $40,000 plus $16,000 (which is 40% of $40,000), so Adrien is now making $56,000.

Lylah's salary also went up by 40%. So, we take her old salary of $30,769.23 and add 40% of it. That's $30,769.23 plus $12,307.69 (which is 40% of $30,769.23), so Lylah is now making about $43,076.92.

To find out how much they are making together, we add Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary:

$56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92

So, the total salary they are making four years later is $99,076.92.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. **Monday:**
   - Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday.
   - So, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.
   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday: 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   - She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - So, on these days, she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.
   - Total for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 7 ร 4 = 28 hours.

4. **Total sleep for the week:**

Julia bought a package of spoons. Her husband also bought 5 spoons. Julia used 3 spoons to taste the stew. When she set the table, she had 12 spoons left.

So, if she had 12 spoons after using 3, that means she had 15 spoons before she used any. 

Now, if she had 15 spoons and her husband added 5 spoons, that means she must have had 10 spoons from the package she bought.

So, the package Julia bought had 10 spoons.

- 4 watermelons, which is 4 times 45 dollars, so that's 180 dollars.
- 20 peppers, which is 20 times 15 dollars, so that's 300 dollars.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

The hospital sees 500 people each day. Each person is there for 24 minutes. So, the total time spent on all patients is:

500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes

Now, we need to turn those minutes into hours because the charges are by the hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

The hospital charges patients $200 for each hour. So, the total money the hospital gets from patients is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

But the doctors also get paid. They charge the hospital $150 for each hour. So, the total money the hospital pays to the doctors is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we subtract what they pay the doctors from what they get from the patients:

$40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

Now, add all that up:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

There's a 20% delivery fee on top of that. To find 20% of $20.00:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

So, the delivery fee is $4.00.

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip.

Now, add the delivery fee and the tip to the total:
$20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, Rory's delivery order will cost:
$29.00

"Well, let's see. Mark took a test with 75 questions and he could do 5 questions every hour. He had 8 hours to finish it. So, he did:

5 questions/hour ร 8 hours = 40 questions

That means he didn't finish 75 - 40 = 35 questions.

The next day, he took another test with 100 questions. He still did 5 questions every hour and had 6 hours to finish. So, he did:

5 questions/hour ร 6 hours = 30 questions

That means he didn't finish 100 - 30 = 70 questions.

So, in total, he didn't finish 35 + 70 = 105 questions.

"Okay, let's see. If there are 12 blue gumballs, and the pink gumballs are 22 more than four times the blue ones, we can figure it out like this:

First, we take the number of blue gumballs, which is 12, and multiply it by 4:
12 times 4 is 48.

Then, we add 22 to that:
48 plus 22 is 70.

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"Well, let's see. There are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the rest must be semi-automatic. 

If we add the automatic and manual cars together, that's 12 + 4, which equals 16. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is 20 - 16, which is 4.

To find the percentage, we take the number of semi-automatic cars, which is 4, and divide it by the total number of cars, which is 20. Then we multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, \( \frac{4}{20} \times 100 = 20\% \).

20%"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about numbers but not much else.

We got 700 bees in total. Now, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. So, let's break it down:

1. If we say there's 1 queen, then there are 2 baby bees.
2. If there are 2 baby bees, then there are 4 worker bees.

So, for every 1 queen, there are 2 baby bees and 4 worker bees. That's 7 bees in total for every queen.

Now, if we have 700 bees in total, we can divide 700 by 7 to find out how many groups of 7 bees we have:
\[ 700 \div 7 = 100 \]

So, there are 100 groups of 7 bees. In each group, there are 4 worker bees. So, the total number of worker bees is:
\[ 100 \times 4 = 400 \]

So, there are 400 worker bees.

"Well, let's see. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. That's 2 hours times 7 days in a week, which gives us 14 hours. If he worked those 14 hours instead, and he earns $10 an hour, then he'd make 14 times 10, which is 140 dollars. So, Jordan would earn 140 dollars in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

John buys:
- Milk for 2 dollars (that's food)
- Eggs for 3 dollars (that's food too)
- Light bulbs for 3 dollars (not food)
- Cups for 3 dollars (not food)
- Roach traps for 4 dollars (definitely not food)

First, let's add up the food:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total for food: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Now, let's add up the nonfood stuff:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total for nonfood: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

There's a 10% tax on the nonfood stuff. So, we need to figure out what 10% of 10 dollars is:
10% of 10 dollars = 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar

Now, add the tax to the nonfood total:
10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars

Finally, add the total for food and the total for nonfood (including tax):
5 dollars (food) + 11 dollars (nonfood with tax) = 16 dollars

So, everything costs:
16 dollars"
"Well, let's see. Kim's got 3 clients already and he's talkin' to 5 more. So, he's got 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The bleach costs $2 a bottle, so that's $4 for the bleach. The cloths cost $5 a pack. So, for each client, it's $4 for the bleach and $5 for the cloths, which adds up to $9.

Now, for 8 clients, that's 8 times $9, which is $72. That's how much he spends on stuff to clean the houses.

He says he's gonna make $92 a week. So, to find out how much he's left with after he pays for the cleaning stuff, we take the $92 he makes and subtract the $72 he spends. That's $92 minus $72, which is $20.

So, Kim will make $20 profit each week.

"Well, let's see. John's got 10 hectares of land, and each hectare has 100 pineapples. So, that's 10 times 100, which gives us 1000 pineapples in total. Now, he can pick these pineapples every 3 months. Since a year has 12 months, he can pick them 4 times a year. So, if he picks 1000 pineapples 4 times, that's 1000 times 4, which equals 4000 pineapples in a year.

"Well, let's see. Johnny's got three different Lego sets on the floor. The first one has 500 pieces. The second one has three times as many pieces as the first, so that's 1500 pieces. The third one has a quarter of the pieces of the first set, so that's 125 pieces. 

Now, to find out how many pieces Johnny has to pick up, we add 'em all together: 500 + 1500 + 125. That makes 2125 pieces.

So, Johnny has to pick up 2125 pieces.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who's been watching bees all day.

First, I saw 30 bees leave the hive in the morning. Then, in the next 6 hours, I saw half of that number come back. So, 15 bees came back.

After that, I saw twice as many bees leave as I did in the morning. That means 60 bees left.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that had left and hadn't come back yet came back. So, I need to figure out how many bees that is.

- 30 bees left in the morning, and 15 came back, so 15 bees were still out.
- 60 more bees left later, and none of those came back yet.

So, in the last 6 hours, 15 (from the morning) + 60 (from later) = 75 bees came back.

So, the number of bees I saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:

75"
"Well, let's see. The adult ticket costs $12, and the child ticket costs $10. So, if you add those up, it's $22 for both tickets. Now, if the lady got $8 back, that means she must have given the cashier $30.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how far Steve and Tim have to go to get home. Steve lives 3 miles away, and Tim lives 2 miles away. We need to convert these miles into feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute.

1 mile is 5280 feet, so:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's figure out how long it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, so:
- Time for Steve: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, so:
- Time for Tim: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long the winner will be waiting. The winner is the one who gets home first, and the loser is the one who gets home last.

- Difference in time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"Well, lemme think this through. Shawnda's got a bike inflation service, and she charges 25 cents for each tire. 

First, 5 people came by with bicycles. Bicycles got 2 tires each, so that's 5 bicycles times 2 tires, which is 10 tires. 

Then, 3 people came by with tricycles. Tricycles got 3 tires each, so that's 3 tricycles times 3 tires, which is 9 tires. 

Lastly, one person came by with a unicycle. Unicycles got 1 tire, so that's just 1 tire.

Now, let's add up all the tires: 10 tires from bicycles, 9 tires from tricycles, and 1 tire from the unicycle. That's 10 + 9 + 1, which is 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so 20 tires times 25 cents is 500 cents. 

Since 100 cents make a dollar, 500 cents is 5 dollars.

"Well, let's see. Carl bought ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies. So, that's 10 times 6, which is 60 cookies. Each cookie costs 10 cents, so 60 cookies would cost 60 times 10 cents, which is 600 cents or $6. Carl paid with a $10 bill, so he should get back $10 minus $6, which is $4.

"Well, let's see. Dave had a big pack of fries. He ate 14 of 'em. Then a seagull came and ate half as many as Dave, so that's 7 more fries gone. After that, three pigeons came and each ate 3 fries, so that's 9 more fries gone. 

Now, we're left with some fries, but a raccoon came and took two-thirds of what was left. Then, an ant came and took one more fry. In the end, there were 5 fries left.

Let's work backwards to figure out how many fries there were at the start.

1. After the ant took one fry, there were 5 fries left. So before the ant came, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
2. The raccoon took two-thirds of the fries, so the 6 fries left were one-third of what was there before the raccoon. So, before the raccoon, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries.
3. The pigeons ate 9 fries, so before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.
4. The seagull ate 7 fries, so before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.
5. Dave ate 14 fries, so before Dave, there were 34 + 14 = 48 fries.

So, Dave must have had 48 fries when he bought the pack.

"Well, let's see. Kimo goes to school on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and he has three 1-hour classes each of those days. So, that's 3 hours a day, and 3 days a week, which makes 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, that's 4 hours a day, and 2 days a week, which makes 8 hours.

So, in one week, Kimo spends 9 hours on the MWF days and 8 hours on the TTh days, which adds up to 17 hours a week.

Now, if there are 16 weeks in a semester, we just need to multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks. So, 17 hours a week times 16 weeks is 272 hours.

"Well, let's see. Bill bakes a bunch of stuff every day. He makes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes. Now, we need to figure out how long all these things would be if we lined them up end to end.

First, the rolls. Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is about a third of a foot. So, 300 rolls would be 300 divided by 3, which is 100 feet.

Next, the croissants. Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is half a foot. So, 120 croissants would be 120 divided by 2, which is 60 feet.

Finally, the baguettes. Each baguette is 2 feet long. So, 60 baguettes would be 60 times 2, which is 120 feet.

Now, we add all these up: 100 feet for the rolls, 60 feet for the croissants, and 120 feet for the baguettes. That's 100 + 60 + 120, which equals 280 feet.

So, if you put all the baked goods end to end, they would be 280 feet long.

"Well, let's see. The monkeys need 200 bananas a month, the gorillas need 400 bananas a month, and the baboons need 100 bananas a month. So, if we add all that up, it's 200 plus 400 plus 100, which makes 700 bananas every month for all the apes.

Now, the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months. So, we need to figure out how many bananas are needed for 2 months. If they need 700 bananas in one month, then for 2 months, it would be 700 times 2, which is 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"Alright, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Blake and Kelly are having a race to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They're running on a football field that's 100 yards long.

**Blake:**
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each time he runs back and forth, he covers 100 yards there and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards.
- So, Blake runs \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- That's 100 yards there and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards.
- Then, Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The 40-yard line and back is 40 yards there and 40 yards back, which is 80 yards.
- So, Kelly runs \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards for this part.
- Adding the first run, Kelly runs \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

Now, let's see who ran farther and by how much:
- Blake ran 3000 yards.
- Kelly ran 2920 yards.
- The difference is \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

So, Blake ran 80 yards farther than Kelly.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water. On Tuesday, they added 7 more feet of water. So, on Tuesday, the tank had:

17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet of water.

Now, on Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet.

Two-thirds of 24 feet is:

(2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

So, the tankโs water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"Well, let's see. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. That's 10 + 6 + 3, which is 19 fish for Anakin.

Now, Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so that's 10 - 5, which is 5 starfish. He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so that's 6 - 3, which is 3 sea horses. And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so that's 3 + 2, which is 5 clownfish.

So, for Locsin, that's 5 + 3 + 5, which is 13 fish.

Now, if we add Anakin's 19 fish and Locsin's 13 fish together, we get 19 + 13, which is 32 fish.

"Well, let's see. If a bag of marbles costs $20 and it goes up by 20% every two months, we need to figure out how many times it goes up in 36 months. 

36 months is 3 years, and if it goes up every 2 months, that's 18 times it goes up. Each time it goes up, it's 20% more, which means it's 1.2 times the price before. 

So, we start with $20 and multiply it by 1.2, 18 times. That's a lot of multiplying! But if we do it, we end up with about $766.75.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my coins.

First, we got 5 red cars. Each red car costs $4. So, 5 red cars times $4 each is:
5 * 4 = $20

Next, we got 3 action figures. Each action figure costs $5. So, 3 action figures times $5 each is:
3 * 5 = $15

Now, the doll. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost:
3 * 5 = $15

So, the doll costs $15.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Red cars: $20
- Action figures: $15
- Doll: $15

Total cost of all the toys:
20 + 15 + 15 = $50

So, all the toys together are worth $50.

Now, if she does the taxes herself, she loses $105. If she hires the accountant, she spends $90. So, she saves $105 - $90, which is $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out on my own.

Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is, say, 8 years old, Seth would be 16. But we don't know their exact ages yet, so let's call Brooke's age \( B \) and Seth's age \( S \).

We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So in 2 years, Seth will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of these ages is 28:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify that:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we know \( S = 2B \), so we can substitute \( 2B \) for \( S \) in the equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Now, to find out how much the whole uniform costs, we add the hat, the jacket, and the pants together. So, $25 for the hat, $75 for the jacket, and $50 for the pants. That's $150 total.

So, each uniform costs $150.

- Insects got 6 legs each. If there's 90 insects, that's 90 times 6, which is 540 legs.
- Them rare mutant invertebrates got 10 legs each. If there's 3 of 'em, that's 3 times 10, which is 30 legs.

Now, to find the total age, we add 'em all up:
8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

So, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"Well, let's see. Jessica has to pay some bills every month. She's got her student loans, which are $300, her credit card, which is $200, and her house payment, which is $500. If we add all those up, that's $1000 she has to pay every month.

Now, she wants to pay 50% more than what she has to. Half of $1000 is $500. So, if she pays 50% more, she'll be paying $1000 plus $500, which is $1500 every month.

To find out how much she pays in a year, we need to multiply $1500 by 12, because there are 12 months in a year. So, $1500 times 12 is $18000.

"Well, let's see. Billy's got 60 potatoes to prep for the family reunion. He spends about a minute and a half peeling each one, and then just a quick 5 seconds to cut 'em up.

First, we figure out the peeling time:

Next, the cutting time:
- 5 seconds per potato, so for 60 potatoes, that's 5 times 60, which is 300 seconds. Now, 300 seconds is the same as 5 minutes.

So, we add the peeling and cutting times together:
- 90 minutes for peeling plus 5 minutes for cutting equals 95 minutes.

Billy will take 95 minutes to finish prepping all the potatoes.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Juan and Carlos are selling lemonade. They make 20 glasses of lemonade from one gallon. Each glass sells for 50 cents. So, for one gallon, they make 20 glasses times 50 cents, which is 10 dollars.

Now, to make one gallon, they spend 3 dollars on lemons and 2 dollars on sugar, so that's 5 dollars in total for one gallon.

If they made 25 dollars in profit, we need to figure out how many gallons they sold. For each gallon, they make 10 dollars in sales and spend 5 dollars, so they make 5 dollars in profit per gallon.

To make 25 dollars in profit, they must have sold 25 dollars divided by 5 dollars per gallon, which is 5 gallons.

Since they spent 3 dollars on lemons for each gallon, and they made 5 gallons, they spent 3 dollars times 5 gallons, which is 15 dollars on lemons.

So, the amount they spent on lemons is:

To find out how many Chinese there are, we do:
240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 (Chinese)

Now, we know that 60 of the Chinese participants are boys. To find out how many are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese:

160 (Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

So, there are 100 girls on the Chinese team.

4. After paying for rent and car fuel, he has 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars left.
5. He donates half of what's left to his favorite charity, so that's 1250 dollars.
6. After the donation, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars left.
7. He gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, so that's 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.
8. After giving money to his daughter and wife, he has 1250 - 900 = 350 dollars left.

So, Zaid will have 350 dollars left after all these expenses and donations.

"Well, let's see. Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 less than Bo, so that means Monic has 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 46 crabs. Now, if we add all their crabs together, we get:

40 (Bo's crabs) + 36 (Monic's crabs) + 46 (Rani's crabs) = 122 crabs

So, the total number of crabs they have together is 122."
"Well, let's see. Lloyd makes 10 dollars for each hour he tutors. He tutored for 5 hours in the first week, so that's 10 times 5, which is 50 dollars. In the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so that's 10 times 8, which is 80 dollars. Add those up, 50 plus 80, and he made 130 dollars in total for the first two weeks.

"Well, let's see. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes, that means they got 3 parts out of 4. The total number of votes is 80, so we need to figure out what 3/4 of 80 is.

First, we divide 80 by 4 to find out what 1/4 of 80 is:
80 รท 4 = 20

So, 1/4 of 80 is 20. Now, to find 3/4, we multiply 20 by 3:
20 ร 3 = 60

The winner got 60 votes. Since the total number of votes is 80, the loser must have gotten the rest:
80 - 60 = 20

So, the loser got 20 votes.

"Well, let's see. Sandra, the florist, ordered some flowers, and Fred's got to get the red roses right. She ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. And she also got 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations.

So, if 200 pink calla lilies are five times the white carnations, then the number of white carnations is 200 divided by 5, which is 40.

Now, if she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, and she has 40 white carnations, then the red roses she ordered are 4 times 40, which is 160.

So, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra happy.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out.

Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. 

Now, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 14 (because 28 divided by 2 is 14). So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5, which is 19 years old.

If Mark was 19 years old two years ago, then now Mark is 21 years old (because 19 + 2 = 21).

Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is 21, then Jean is 21 + 2, which is 23 years old.

So, Jean is 23 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out in a simple way.

We got two teams running a 4 by 400 meter relay. Each team has four runners, and they each run 400 meters.

**Team 1:**
- Each runner takes 55 seconds.
- So, the total time for Team 1 is \( 55 \times 4 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2:**
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so 57 seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so 51 seconds.
- So, the total time for Team 2 is \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

Now, to find out how many seconds Team 1 wins by, we subtract the total time of Team 1 from the total time of Team 2:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \]

So, Team 1 wins by 2 seconds.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

### Problem:
Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?

### Step 1: Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. That's 3 out of 6 numbers.

So, the chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 50\%
\]

### Step 2: Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. That's 3 out of 6 numbers.

The chance of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 50\%
\]

Since the rolls are separate, the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
50\% \times 50\% = 25\%
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the Two Probabilities
Now, we need to see how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.

To find out how much more likely it is, we divide the two probabilities:
\[
\frac{50\%}{25\%} = 2
\]

This means it's 2 times more likely, or 200% more likely.

### Final Answer:
200%"
"Well, if Jenna's mom picked 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many, that means Jenna picked 10 apples. So, together they picked 20 plus 10, which is 30 apples.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can count and do some basic figuring out.

So, we have 160 pieces of straw, and we need to figure out how many rats are in each cage. Here's what we know:

- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There's also a pen of rabbits that gets 20 pieces of straw.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of straw the hamsters and rabbits get:

- Hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces each = 50 pieces
- Rabbits: 20 pieces

So, the hamsters and rabbits together get:
50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces

Now, we know the total straw is 160 pieces, so the rats must get:
160 pieces (total) - 70 pieces (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can figure out how many rats there are in total:
90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats

There are 3 cages of rats, so to find out how many rats are in each cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:
15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage

So, the number of rats in each cage is:
5

**Final Answer: 5**"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed on a 2% interest each month. If Mandy pays after 3 months, we need to add the interest for each month.

First month:
- Interest: 2% of $100 = $2
- Total after first month: $100 + $2 = $102

Second month:
- Interest: 2% of $102 = $2.04
- Total after second month: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

Third month:
- Interest: 2% of $104.04 = $2.08
- Total after third month: $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12

So, Mandy should give Benedict:

"Well, let's see. The trader buys the wheat for $20 a bag and it costs $2 to move each bag to the warehouse. So, each bag costs him $22. He sells each bag for $30, so he makes $8 profit on each bag. If he made a total of $400 profit, we can figure out how many bags he sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag. 

So, $400 divided by $8 is 50. 

The trader sold 50 bags.

"Well, let's see. Three friends went to the fair and bought 3 tickets for $20.25. That's the ticket money. They spent $4.50 less on food, so that's $20.25 minus $4.50, which is $15.75 for food. They also went on two rides, and each ride cost $33, so that's $33 times 2, which is $66 for the rides.

Now, let's add it all up: $20.25 for the tickets, $15.75 for the food, and $66 for the rides. That's $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102 in total.

Since there are three friends, they split the cost evenly. So, $102 divided by 3 is $34 each.

So, each of them paid:

The ducks need 5 pounds of insects per day.

"Well, let's see. Tom starts with 50 trees. Every year, he plants 10 and cuts down 2, so he ends up with 8 more trees each year. 

If he does this for 10 years, he'll have:
50 trees + (8 trees/year * 10 years) = 50 trees + 80 trees = 130 trees.

But then, after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, 30% of 130 trees is:
130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees.

So, the number of trees left is:
130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees.

So, Tom has 91 trees left.

"Well, let's see. On Friday, Sue had 18 pink flamingos in her yard. On Saturday, the neighbors took away one third of them, which is 6, and painted them white. So, she had 12 pink ones left and 6 white ones. Then on Sunday, they added another 18 pink flamingos. So, now she has 12 pink ones from before plus 18 new pink ones, which makes 30 pink flamingos. She still has 6 white ones. 

To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white ones, we just subtract the number of white ones from the number of pink ones. So, 30 pink minus 6 white equals 24 more pink flamingos.

So, one pen costs $1.50.

Now, if we want to know how much 8 pens cost, we just multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

In the third month, she got twice as many as the total of the first and second months, so that's 200 more cards. 

Now, if we add all of that up: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and he splits them equally between two publishers. So, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents for each sentence. So, for 500 sentences, he gets:
500 sentences ร 5 cents = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so that's 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he gets:
500 sentences ร 10 cents = 5000 cents

Now, we add what he gets from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"Well, let's see. Baldur gets 5 pails in the mornin' and 6 pails in the afternoon. That's 11 pails a day. Each pail holds 5 liters of water. So, if you multiply 11 pails by 5 liters, you get 55 liters of water.

"Well, let's see. John got a big prize at work, which was $5000. That's a nice chunk of change right there. Now, he also got a raise of 5% on his weekly pay. He used to make $2000 a week, so let's figure out what 5% of that is.

5% of $2000 is like taking 5 pennies out of every 100 pennies, so that's 5 * 20 = $100 more each week. So now, he makes $2000 + $100 = $2100 a week.

Now, there are 52 weeks in a year, so if he makes $2100 a week, he makes $2100 * 52 = $109,200 in a year.

Add the $5000 prize to that, and he made $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200 that year.

So, John made $114,200 that year."
"Well, let's see. Josie's got a 10-acre farm, and each acre gives her 5 tons of grapes. So, if we do the math, that's 10 acres times 5 tons, which equals 50 tons of grapes. Now, each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, 50 tons times 2 barrels per ton gives us 100 barrels of wine. 

So, Josie's farm makes 100 barrels of wine each year.

Then, he had omelets for breakfast 3 days, and each omelet had 1 more slice of cheese than the sandwiches, so that's 3 slices per omelet. For the omelets, he used:

3 days ร 3 slices/day = 9 slices

Lastly, he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese for that.

Now, let's add it all up: 32 pens she started with, plus 54 blue pens, plus 12 red pens. That's 32 + 54 + 12, which equals 98 pens.

So, Janet has 98 pens now.

Now, to get an average of 93 with five tests, we need to figure out what the total of all the scores should be. If the average is 93, then the total of the five scores should be 93 times 5, which is 465.

The sum of the four scores we have is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86, which is 367.

125 kilometers a week * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

Then, for the next part, he rides his bike 2 times a week, and each time he goes 60 kilometers. So, in one week, he rides:

2 times a week * 60 kilometers = 120 kilometers

He does this for 3 weeks, so:

120 kilometers a week * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

Add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples together, 1000 grams plus 1600 grams, and you get 2600 grams.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. So, we subtract $1200 from $36000:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cups are in twenty dozen. Since one dozen is 12:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

Finally, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the cost of each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Sara wants to buy a jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, Sara needs $70 in total.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, she still needs:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time. So, her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to have enough money.

"Well, let's see. Jerry's got some chickens, and he collects 42 eggs every day. The red chickens give him 3 eggs each, and the white ones give him 5 eggs each. He's got two more white chickens than red ones.

Now, the red chickens give him \( 3R \) eggs, and the white chickens give him \( 5(R + 2) \) eggs. All together, that's 42 eggs.

So, we can write it like this:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Let's solve it step by step:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Now, if Gary walks at 3 miles an hour, we need to figure out how long it takes to walk 15 miles. If he walks 3 miles in one hour, then to walk 15 miles, it would take him 15 divided by 3, which is 5 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting things in my head.

First day, Sloane saw 100 customers. That's easy to remember.

The next day, she saw 50 more customers than the first day. So, that's 100 plus 50, which is 150 customers.

Now, by the end of the third day, she counted a total of 500 customers. We need to find out how many customers she saw on the third day.

So, we add up the customers from the first two days:
100 (first day) + 150 (second day) = 250 customers.

To find out how many customers were on the third day, we subtract the total from the first two days from the total for all three days:
500 (total) - 250 (first two days) = 250 customers.

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about water and pools, but not much about fancy math.

So, we got two pools, and both are leaking at 4 gallons every minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's break it down:

1. **Four minutes ago:**
   - The small pool had 16 gallons more than it has now (because it's been leaking for 4 minutes).
   - The big pool also had 16 gallons more than it has now.

2. **Now:**
   - The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool has \( S \) gallons now. So, four minutes ago, it had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

The big pool now has \( 4S \) gallons. Four minutes ago, it had \( 4S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, let's solve this step by step:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and said she'd pay back 10% more. So, 10% of $2000 is $200. That means she needs to pay back $2000 + $200, which is $2200.

Now, she's paying $165 every month for 12 months. So, $165 times 12 months is $1980.

If she needs to pay back $2200 and she pays $1980, the amount left is $2200 - $1980, which is $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian is 3 times 21, which is 63 years old.
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack is 2 times 21, which is 42 years old.

Now, let's see how old they will be in three years:
1. Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
2. Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
3. Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

To find the average age in three years, we add up their ages and divide by 3:

135 รท 3 = 45

So, the average age of the three in three years is 45.

"Well, let's see. Naomi got 68 points. Yuri got 10 more than half of what Naomi got, so that's 34 plus 10, which is 44 points. Brianna got 17 more than Naomi, so that's 68 plus 17, which is 85 points. Now, if we add up what Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna got, that's 68 plus 44 plus 85, which is 197 points. The total points are 251, so if we take away the 197 points that the others got, we find out how many points Jojo got. So, 251 minus 197 is 54 points. 

Jojo scored 54 points.

"Well, let's see. Carmen takes 10 minutes for each crossword puzzle, and she did 3 of them. So, that's 10 minutes times 3, which is 30 minutes. For the sudoku puzzles, she takes 5 minutes each, and she did 8 of them. So, that's 5 minutes times 8, which is 40 minutes. Now, if we add the time for the crossword puzzles and the sudoku puzzles together, we get 30 minutes plus 40 minutes, which is 70 minutes.

"Well, let's see. The tank had 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so that leaves 30 liters. Then, she collected rainwater that was twice what was left, so that's 60 liters. Add that 60 liters to the 30 liters left, and you get 90 liters. So, the tank now has 90 liters of water.

"Well, let's see. Andy plants 90 geraniums, and he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, if he plants 40 fewer petunias, that means he plants 50 petunias. Now, to find out how many flowers he plants in total, we add the geraniums and the petunias together. 

90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers

So, Andy plants 140 flowers in total.

140"
"Well, let's see. The company spent $15000 on ads for one year. Then, they spent a third of that amount the next year. A third of $15000 is $5000. So, if you add $15000 and $5000, the total is $20000.

20000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting out coins.

Carlos is renting a canoe. It costs him $30 for each hour he uses it. He uses it for 3 hours. So, we need to multiply 30 by 3:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]
So, Carlos pays $90.

Benji is renting a banana boat raft. It costs him $18 for each hour he uses it. He uses it for 5 hours. So, we need to multiply 18 by 5:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]
So, Benji pays $90.

Now, to find out how much they pay together, we add what Carlos paid to what Benji paid:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, they pay a total of $180 for their rentals.

180"
"Well, let's see. If it takes 6 days to go to Rochester by bus, and it takes half that time to come back by car, that means it takes 3 days to come back. So, if you add the 6 days going there and the 3 days coming back, that's 9 days total.

"Well, let's see. James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. That's 90 cards in total.

Now, he loses 8 water type cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards left.

He also buys 14 more grass type cards, so he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards now.

So, the new total is 30 fire type + 34 grass type + 32 water type = 96 cards.

To find the chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, 32 water type cards out of 96 total cards is 32 / 96 = 1/3.

1/3 of 100 is about 33.33, which rounds to 33%.

So, the chance of picking a water type card is 33%.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, the base burrito costs $6.50. That's the starting point.

Then, Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each. So, the sauces cost 2 times $0.25, which is $0.50.

Now, let's add all these extra costs:
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- Sauces: $0.50

Adding these up:
$2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

So, the total cost of the burrito with all the extras is:
$6.50 (base) + $4.50 (extras) = $11.00

Chad also decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, which includes chips and a drink. So, we add that to the total:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes:
$9.00

"Well, let's see. Kalinda can put 4 pieces in a minute, and her mom can do half that, so her mom can do 2 pieces in a minute. Together, they can do 4 plus 2, which is 6 pieces every minute.

Now, if they need to do 360 pieces, and they can do 6 pieces a minute, we just need to figure out how many minutes it takes to do 360 pieces. So, 360 divided by 6 is 60 minutes. 

Since 60 minutes is just 1 hour, it will take them 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

"Well, let's see. The farm had 120 baby watermelons. When I first went there, 30% of them were ready. That means 30 out of every 100, so:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready, and I took them home. That leaves:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Two weeks later, I went back, and 3/4 of the remaining 84 were ready. So:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, 63 more watermelons were ready, and I took them home. Now, the number of watermelons that weren't ready is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

"Well, let's break it down in a simple way:

- Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000.
- So, the total cost for the cars is 12 times $20,000, which is $240,000.

- He also has to pay 10% tax on the cars. 
- 10% of $240,000 is $24,000.

- For each car, he pays an extra $1,000 for registration.
- So, for 12 cars, that's 12 times $1,000, which is $12,000.

- Now, we add it all up: $240,000 for the cars, $24,000 for the tax, and $12,000 for the registration.

- That makes a total of $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

So, Mark pays $276,000 for everything.

"Well, let's see. If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs, that means there were 25 bugs. So, if you add the ants and the bugs together, you get 50 ants plus 25 bugs, which makes 75 insects in total.

"Okay, let's think about this. We got 36 penguins sunbathing. One-third of them jump in the water, and another one-third go eat dinner. 

First, we figure out one-third of 36:
\[ 36 \div 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins jump in the water, and 12 penguins go eat dinner. That's 24 penguins in total that left.

Now, we subtract the 24 penguins that left from the 36 penguins we started with:
\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

"Well, let's see. Steve eats 6 tomatoes every day. That's a lot of tomatoes! Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 times 7, which is 42 tomatoes a week. His girlfriend eats half as much as he does, so she eats 21 tomatoes a week. Together, they eat 42 plus 21, which is 63 tomatoes a week.

Now, if one vine can give 3 tomatoes a week, we need to figure out how many vines we need to get 63 tomatoes. We divide 63 by 3, and that gives us 21. So, Steve needs 21 vines.

"Well, let's see. John's got 20 friends, and each one wants 4 slices of pizza. So, that's 20 friends times 4 slices each, which is 80 slices in total. Now, each pizza comes with 8 slices. So, to find out how many pizzas John needs, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza. That's 80 slices divided by 8 slices per pizza, which gives us 10 pizzas. 

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

So, in total, Ram gets to use:
- The 25 pens he bought
- Plus the 5 new pens he made
- Plus the 1 more pen he made

That's 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 pens.

Then, 3 out of 5 of the remaining 700 students left through exit B. That's like saying 3/5 of 700, which is 420 students.

So, 700 minus 420 is 280 students left.

Those 280 students must have gone out through exit C.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that John has 54 candies. The problem says John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, if we divide John's candies by 2, we can find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ 54 \div 2 = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, the problem says James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, if we add 6 to Robert's candies, we can find out how many candies James has:

\[ 27 + 6 = 33 \]

So, James has 33 candies.

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We do this by subtracting the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

Now, if he can write a page in 6 minutes, then for 30 pages, he'd need 180 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is 3 hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Jason has a phone plan that gives him 1000 minutes each month. He talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he spends 15 minutes times 30 days, which is 450 minutes just talking to his boss.

On top of that, he's used 300 more minutes talking to other people. So, we add those 300 minutes to the 450 minutes he spent talking to his boss. That's 450 minutes plus 300 minutes, which equals 750 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he has left. We start with his total minutes, which is 1000, and subtract the 750 minutes he's already used. 

1000 minutes minus 750 minutes equals 250 minutes.

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin had:
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   So, Griffin had:
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]
4. Ginger gave Griffin some fries. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin \( x \).
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]
   So, after Colby took his fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27 \text{ fries}
   \]
6. Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Well, let's see. There are 4 snails in one tank and 32 in the other. The difference between them is 28 snails. Now, it says this difference is twice the number of fish in both tanks together. So, if we split 28 in half, we get 14. That means there are 14 fish in both tanks together. Since both tanks have the same number of fish, we just split 14 in half again. So, there are 7 fish in each tank.

"Well, let's see. The makeup lady charges $250 for each hour. It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day, and she needs it done 4 times a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish. At the end, the makeup lady gives Jean a 10% discount.

First, we figure out how much it costs for one day:
\[ 250 \times 6 = 1500 \]

Then, we figure out how much it costs for one week:
\[ 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \]

Next, we figure out how much it costs for the whole movie:
\[ 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \]

Now, we take off the 10% discount:
\[ 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \]

Jean paid:

So, let's add 'em:
$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Now, she split this $96 three ways with her two parents. So, we need to divide $96 by 3 to see how much each person paid.

Now, let's add up all the cookies. Sue ate 20 on Monday and 26 on Tuesday, so she ate 46 cookies in total. Her sister ate 5 on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, so she ate 18 cookies in total.

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, Sue's 46 cookies would be 46 times 200, which is 9200 calories. Her sister's 18 cookies would be 18 times 200, which is 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue ate, we subtract her sister's total from Sue's total: 9200 minus 3600, which is 5600 calories.

So, Sue ate 5600 more calories than her sister.

3. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is:

4. Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is:
   \[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

5. Each class has 20 students, so if there are 3 girls in the third class, the number of boys in the third class is:

So, the number of boys in the third class is:

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. He also killed three fewer cougars than he did last night. So, if he killed 15 cougars last night, today he killed 15 - 3, which is 12 cougars.

Now, for the wolves, if he killed 12 cougars today, he killed three times that in wolves, so that's 12 times 3, which is 36 wolves.

So, today he killed 12 cougars and 36 wolves, which adds up to 48 animals.

"Well, let's see. If each 10-foot part of the tree weighs 400 pounds, and the tree is 200 feet tall, that means there are 20 of those 10-foot parts in the tree. So, the whole tree would weigh:

20 parts ร 400 pounds/part = 8000 pounds

Now, if the termites ate 30% of the tree, that means they ate:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 ร 8000 = 2400 pounds

So, the tree lost 2400 pounds. To find out how much the tree weighs now, we subtract what the termites ate from the original weight:

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
- Andrea's apples: 52

Now, we need to know how many sets of 12 cookies are in 66 cookies. So, 66 divided by 12 is 5.5 sets of 12 cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour make one set of 12 cookies, we multiply 5.5 by 2 to get the total cups of flour needed: 5.5 x 2 = 11 cups.

First, there's a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the house price. So, 5% of $350,000 is:
\[ 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

Then, there's a transfer fee, which is 12% of the house price. So, 12% of $350,000 is:

1. **Transfer Fees:** He paid 3% of $400,000 for transfer fees.
   \[
   3\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Brokerage Fee:** He also paid 5% of $400,000 for the brokerage fee.
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Remaining Loan:** He still had to pay $250,000 for the loan on the house.

Now, let's add up all the money he had to pay:
\[
12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000
\]

So, the total amount he paid is $282,000. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract this from the selling price:
\[
400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000
\]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:
\[
\boxed{118000}
\]"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way:

1. It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.
2. Then it takes 40% longer to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, 40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes. That means it takes 28 more minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
3. So, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes.
4. After the oil is heated, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil. So, it takes 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.
5. The total time from starting to heat the oil to having the chicken cooked is 48 minutes + 43 minutes = 91 minutes.

So, the total time is:
91"
"Well, let's see. The real estate fella spent 50 bucks on each newspaper ad, and he put up 50 of 'em. So, that's 50 times 50, which is 250 dollars for all the newspaper ads.

Then, he spent 75 bucks on each TV ad, and he did 15 of those. So, that's 75 times 15, which is 1125 dollars for all the TV ads.

Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add the 250 dollars for the newspaper ads and the 1125 dollars for the TV ads. That's 250 plus 1125, which is 1375 dollars.

So, the real estate fella spent 1375 dollars on all the ads.

1375"
"Well, let's see. The juggler can juggle 16 balls, and half of them are golf balls. So, that means there are 8 golf balls. Now, half of these golf balls are blue. So, half of 8 is 4. 

There are 4 blue golf balls.

"Well, let's see. Mary got 3 bags of M&Ms. The first one had 300 M&Ms. The second one had 12 more than the first, so that's 312 M&Ms. The third one had a hole, so it only had half as many as the first, which is 150 M&Ms.

Now, if we add 'em all up:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

So, Mary got 762 M&Ms in total.

762"
"Well, let's see. John's got 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms. Each bedroom's got 2 windows, so that's 6 windows just from the bedrooms in one house. Plus, there's 4 more windows in each house that ain't in the bedrooms. So, that's 10 windows in one house. Since he's got 2 houses, we double that to 20 windows total.

20"
"Well, let's see. The lady bought some cocoa for $4.20, laundry stuff for $9.45, and pasta for $1.35. If we add all that up, it comes to $15.00. She gave the cashier $20, so the change she gets back is $20 minus $15, which is $5.00.

5.00"
"Well, let's see. The whole sweater needs 1800 stitches. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that, so it's 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so that's 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up what we have:
- Body: 900 stitches
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches

That's 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

So, the sleeves together must take the rest of the stitches:
1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve must take:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

315"
"Well, let's see. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, for the tomato seeds, she spent 20 times 40, which is 800 dollars.

Then, she bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, for the celery seeds, she spent 80 times 30, which is 2400 dollars.

Now, to find out the total, we add the money spent on tomato seeds and celery seeds together. That's 800 plus 2400, which equals 3200 dollars.

So, Mrs. Rylan used 3200 dollars to buy the seeds.

3200"
"Well, let's see here. Sean's got a song to learn, and that song's got 54 lines. That's a lot of lines, ain't it?

Now, for the first scene, it's got twice as many lines as the song. So, that's 54 times 2, which is 108 lines. But Sean only has to learn a third of those. So, 108 divided by 3 is 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene, it's got 6 more lines than the song. So, that's 54 plus 6, which is 60 lines. And Sean's got to learn four-fifths of those. So, 60 times 4 divided by 5 is 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

So, 54 plus 36 plus 48 is 138 lines.

Sean's got to memorize 138 lines."
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

First, Carly had 80 cards. Now, 2 out of every 5 cards had the letter A on them. So, we figure out how many cards that is:
\[ 80 \times \frac{2}{5} = 32 \]
So, 32 cards had the letter A.

Now, we take away the 32 A cards from the total:
\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]
So, 48 cards are left.

Next, half of these 48 cards had the letter B on them:
\[ 48 \times \frac{1}{2} = 24 \]
So, 24 cards had the letter B.

Now, we take away the 24 B cards from the 48 cards left:
\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]
So, 24 cards are left.

Then, 5 out of every 8 of these 24 cards had the letter C on them:
\[ 24 \times \frac{5}{8} = 15 \]
So, 15 cards had the letter C.

Finally, we take away the 15 C cards from the 24 cards left:
\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]
So, 9 cards had the letter D.

"Well, let's see. Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and 10 minutes to dig a big hole. If he needs to dig 30 small holes, that's 30 times 3 minutes, which is 90 minutes. For the 15 big holes, that's 15 times 10 minutes, which is 150 minutes. So, all together, that's 90 minutes plus 150 minutes, which is 240 minutes. Now, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is 240 divided by 60, which is 4 hours.

4"
"Well, let's see. Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 right now. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. So, that's 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco, which is 20 more years in total. So, their ages will add up to 20 + 20, which is 40.

40"
"Well, let's see. If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam right now, and in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, we can figure this out step by step.

First, let's say Sam is \( S \) years old now. That means Ruby is \( 6S \) years old now.

In 9 years, Sam will be \( S + 9 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 6S + 9 \) years old.

The problem says that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write it like this:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve it:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"Well, let's see. Peter bought 20 popsicles, and each one costs a quarter, so that's 20 times a quarter. A quarter is 25 cents, so 20 times 25 cents is 500 cents. Since 100 cents make a dollar, 500 cents is 5 dollars.

Then, he bought 4 ice cream bars, and each one costs 50 cents. So, 4 times 50 cents is 200 cents, which is 2 dollars.

Now, if we add the 5 dollars for the popsicles and the 2 dollars for the ice cream bars, that's 7 dollars in total.

7"
"Well, let's see. If a cobra has 70 spots and that's twice as many as a mamba, then a mamba must have 35 spots. Now, if there are 40 cobras, that's 40 times 70 spots, which is 2800 spots. And if there are 60 mambas, that's 60 times 35 spots, which is 2100 spots. Add those together, 2800 plus 2100, and you get 4900 spots in total. Half of 4900 is 2450.

2450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how many people are coming to the soccer game. There are 12 team members, and each one brings 2 guests. So, that's 12 team members times 2 guests, which gives us 24 guests. Add the 12 team members and 3 coaches, and we get:

12 team members + 24 guests + 3 coaches = 39 people.

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas we need. Each pizza can feed 3 people. So, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 people รท 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Now, we need to know how much it will cost. Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza:

13 pizzas ร $15 per pizza = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

195"
"Well, let's see. Katerina makes these fancy necklaces with topaz stones. She puts 8 of these stones in each necklace, and each stone is 1 inch long. So, 8 stones take up 8 inches of the necklace.

The whole necklace is 25 inches long. If 8 inches are taken by the stones, that leaves 17 inches for the silver bits. Now, each silver bit is a quarter of an inch long. To find out how many silver bits fit in 17 inches, you divide 17 by a quarter.

17 divided by a quarter is the same as 17 times 4, which is 68.

So, Katerina uses 68 silver bits in each necklace.

68"
"Well, let's see. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, and then she wrote twice as many in the second week, so that's 40 more. So, Alani wrote 20 + 40, which is 60 stories in total.

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, and then he wrote twice as many in the second week, so that's 80 more. So, Braylen wrote 40 + 80, which is 120 stories in total.

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, and then she wrote twice as many in the second week, so that's 120 more. So, Margot wrote 60 + 120, which is 180 stories in total.

Now, if we add all the stories together, we get 60 (Alani's) + 120 (Braylen's) + 180 (Margot's), which is 360 stories in total.

360"
"Well, if Ann is 9 years old, her brother is twice that, so he's 18. In 3 more years, he'll be 18 plus 3, which makes him 21.

21"
"Well, let's see. Kelly's got 5 quarters and 2 dimes. A quarter is 25 cents, so 5 quarters is 125 cents. A dime is 10 cents, so 2 dimes is 20 cents. Add 'em up, and she's got 145 cents. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she'll have 145 minus 55, which is 90 cents left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting things out.

First, we know there are three rows with 8 stars each. So, we count:
\[ 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

Next, there are two rows with 6 stars each. So, we count:
\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Now, we add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has 76 stars in total. So, we need to find out how many stars are left for the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row has 5 stars. To find out how many 5-star rows there are, we divide the remaining stars by 5:
\[ 40 \div 5 = 8 \text{ rows} \]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

8"
"Well, let's see. Each of them flagstones weighs 75 pounds, and we got 80 of 'em. So, we do a little math:

75 pounds times 80 flagstones equals 6000 pounds total.

Now, each truck can carry 2000 pounds. So, we take the total weight and divide it by what one truck can carry:

6000 pounds divided by 2000 pounds per truck equals 3 trucks.

So, we need 3 trucks to move all them flagstones.

3"
"Well, let's see. The car in the fast lane is going 60 miles an hour, and the car in the slow lane is going half that speed, so it's going 30 miles an hour. If the fast car went 480 miles, we need to figure out how long it took the slow car to go the same distance.

To find out, we divide the distance by the speed. So, 480 miles divided by 30 miles an hour:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the slow car took 16 hours to cover 480 miles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just a regular person who knows how to count.

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. They have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out. So, the total number of medals given out is 39 * 10 = 390.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting things out.

First, we have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, we have:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
That means we have 40 chocolate bars in total.

Now, there are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, the adults will get:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]
That means the adults take 24 chocolate bars.

We started with 40 chocolate bars, and the adults took 24, so we have:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]
That leaves us with 16 chocolate bars for the children.

There are 8 children, and we need to share the 16 chocolate bars equally among them. So, each child will get:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"Well, let's see. Susan works from 8 in the mornin' to 11, that's 3 hours. But she takes a half-hour break, so she's really workin' for 2 and a half hours. 

Now, 2 and a half hours is 150 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes. So, we need to figure out how many 10-minute chunks are in 150 minutes. That's 150 divided by 10, which is 15.

So, she earns $5 for each of those 15 chunks. That means she earns 15 times $5, which is $75.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

1. **Mike's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points.
   - In the fourth round, since Mike has more than 20 points, he gets an extra point.
   - So, Mike now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.

2. **Jim's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
   - In the fourth round, Jim doesn't get an extra point because he has less than 20 points.
   - So, Jim still has 18 points.

3. **Tony's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds, Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.
   - In the fourth round, since Tony has more than 20 points, he gets an extra point.
   - So, Tony now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

4. **Total Points:**
   - Add up all the points: 22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83 points.

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is:

"Well, let's see. Will bought 15 oranges. His oldest son is 8, so he washes 8 oranges. The youngest is half that, so he's 4 and washes 4 oranges. Together, they wash 8 and 4, which is 12 oranges. So, 15 minus 12, that leaves 3 oranges unwashed.

"Well, let's see. On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. That's 170 exercises in total for the first day.

On the second day, he did 20 more pushups, so that's 120 pushups. He did 10 fewer squats, so that's 40 squats. And he did twice as many dumbbell presses, so that's 40 dumbbell presses. That's 200 exercises for the second day.

Now, if we add the exercises from both days together, we get 170 + 200, which is 370 exercises in total.

"Well, let's see. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice for each meal, and they have two meals a day where they eat rice. So, for one meal, the whole family eats:

5 people ร 0.2 kg = 1 kg of rice

Since they eat rice twice a day, that means they eat:

1 kg ร 2 = 2 kg of rice per day

Now, in a week, they would eat:

2 kg ร 7 days = 14 kg of rice

So, if they have a 42 kg bag of rice, it would last:

42 kg รท 14 kg per week = 3 weeks

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

- Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

So, if we add all that up: 15 + 12 + 18 + 20, that's 65 crates.

Now, if his goal was 120 crates, and he sold 65, then he was short by 120 - 65, which is 55 crates.

- Then, someone bids $250.
- Carmen bids $300.
- Another person bids $350.
- Carmen bids $400.
- The third person bids $450.
- Carmen bids $500 and wins.

"Well, let's see. John goes to work 5 days a week, and his work is 30 miles away. So, he goes 30 miles there and 30 miles back, which is 60 miles a day. 

Now, 60 miles a day for 5 days is 300 miles a week. He works 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 miles times 50 weeks, which is 15,000 miles a year.

He gets charged $2 for every mile, so 15,000 miles times $2 is $30,000 for the miles.

He also gives his driver a $150 bonus every month. There are 12 months in a year, so that's $150 times 12, which is $1,800 for the bonuses.

"Well, let's see. Elise's dad had 250 books, and she's been selling 'em for three years. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year. This year, she sold 45 books. So, in the first year, she must've sold 90 books, 'cause 45 times 2 is 90.

Now, there are 50 books left unsold. So, she's sold 250 minus 50, which is 200 books in total over the three years.

If she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year, that's 135 books in total for those two years. So, in the second year, she must've sold 200 minus 135, which is 65 books.

Each book sells for 20 dollars, so in the second year, she made 65 times 20, which is 1300 dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person who knows how to count money.

1. **How many days does Watson work in April?**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - There are about 4 weeks in a month, so he works 4 weeks * 5 days/week = 20 days in April.

2. **How many hours does Watson work in April?**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - So, in 20 days, he works 20 days * 10 hours/day = 200 hours.

3. **How much does Watson earn from his hourly wage?**
   - Watson earns $10 per hour.
   - So, for 200 hours, he earns 200 hours * $10/hour = $2000.

4. **How much does Watson earn from his weekly bonus?**
   - Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4 weeks in April, so he gets 4 weeks * $300/week = $1200 in bonuses.

5. **Total earnings for April:**
   - Watson's total earnings are his hourly wage plus his bonus.
   - So, $2000 (hourly wage) + $1200 (bonus) = $3200.

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

"Well, let's see. John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. That means he beats 16 people because 80% of 20 is 16. So, if he beats 16 people, he must have lost to the rest. 

20 - 16 = 4

"Okay, let's break it down simple-like.

The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of them. So, they sell:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves} \]

That leaves:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves} \]

In the afternoon and evening, they sell half of what's left. So, they sell:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

These 10 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and evening. So, in the afternoon, they sell:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves} \]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

"Okay, let's think about this. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. That means Joey loses 2 pounds each week. Now, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in one week, which is 2 pounds. So, if Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds, to lose 8 pounds, she would need:

4 weeks for 2 pounds
8 pounds is 4 times 2 pounds

So, Sandy needs 4 weeks times 4, which is 16 weeks.

"Well, let's see. If the ice cream used to cost $13 and now it's $11, that means you save $2 on each tub. If you buy 2 tubs, you save 2 times $2, which is $4.

Now, for the milk, if each packet is $0.5 cheaper, and you buy 4 packets, you save 4 times $0.5, which is $2.

So, if you save $4 on the ice cream and $2 on the milk, you save a total of $4 + $2, which is $6.

Theo has $6000 to spend. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's 6 * $100 = $600. Then he buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so that's 3 * $50 = $150. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. So, 5 * $100 = $500, and $500 + $700 = $1200 for the flight ticket.

Now, let's add up what he's spent so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 to spend on everything else.

So, the amount left for buying gifts is:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050.

Theo has $2050 to spend on gifts.

"Well, let's see. In our family, we got 5 people. Three of us eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day. 

First, let's figure out how many eggs the three of us who eat 3 eggs each day use:
3 people times 3 eggs each equals 9 eggs.

Next, for the two of us who eat 2 eggs each day:
2 people times 2 eggs each equals 4 eggs.

So, every day, we use 9 eggs plus 4 eggs, which is 13 eggs.

Now, to find out how many eggs we use in a week, we take the 13 eggs we use each day and multiply that by 7 days in a week:
13 eggs times 7 days equals 91 eggs.

So, we use 91 eggs in a week.

"Well, let's see. If Quinn is 30, and Jane is 3 years younger, that means Jane is 27. Now, if Trent is 5 years older than Jane, then Trent must be 32.

32"
"Well, let's see if I can figure this out. Cera is 46 now, so six years ago, she was 40. Back then, Noah was half her age, so he was 20. That means Noah is 26 now.

Now, six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. So, it was 3000 times 20, which is 60,000. The problem says that six years ago, the population was half of what it is now. So, if 60,000 is half, then the population now must be 120,000.

So, the population of Chile now is 120,000.

120000"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about football but not much about math.

So, we got 105 players on the team. The offense has twice as many players as the defense, and the special teams have half as many players as the defense. We need to figure out how many players are on the defense.

Let's call the number of players on the defense ""D.""

- The offense has 2 times D, so that's 2D.
- The special teams have half of D, so that's D/2.

Now, we add them all up:
D (defense) + 2D (offense) + D/2 (special teams) = 105

To make it easier, let's add them up:
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

That's the same as:
3D + D/2 = 105

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply everything by 2:
2 * 3D + 2 * D/2 = 2 * 105
6D + D = 210

Now we have:
7D = 210

To find D, we divide both sides by 7:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"Well, let's see. Martha invited some folks over for her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each, and 3 families with 4 people each. That's 12 people from the first 2 families and 12 people from the other 3 families, so that's 24 people in total.

Now, 8 people couldn't come because they were sick. And 1/4 of that number, which is 2 people, had other things to do. So, 8 plus 2 is 10 people who couldn't make it.

If 24 people were invited and 10 couldn't come, then 24 minus 10 is 14 people who showed up.

So, 14 people came to Martha's party.

"Well, let's see. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend. He already had 50 marbles. His dad gave him 2 outta every 5 marbles he bought from his friend, so that's 8 more marbles. 

Now, let's add 'em up:
- 20 marbles from his friend
- 50 marbles he already had
- 8 marbles from his dad

That's 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so:
78 marbles times 2 kgs each = 156 kgs.

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is:

"Well, let's see. The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To figure out how much water it can hold, you multiply these numbers together: 6 times 4 times 5. That gives you 120 cubic feet of water.

Now, it costs 10 cents to fill each cubic foot. So, you take the 120 cubic feet and multiply it by 10 cents. That's 120 times 10 cents, which is $12.

So, it costs $12 to fill the pool.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

If there are 30 boys in the classroom, and there are 3 times as many girls as boys, then:
- Number of girls = 3 times 30 = 90 girls.

Next, if there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, then:
- Number of nongendered children = 1/10 of 30 = 3 nongendered children.

Now, to find the total number of children, we add up the boys, girls, and nongendered children:
- Total children = 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 123 children.

So, the total number of children in the classroom is:
123"
"Well, let's see. If for every pole, you need 3 wires, and there are 45 wires, then you just divide the number of wires by 3 to find out how many poles you need. So, 45 divided by 3 is 15.

"Well, let's see. At the start, there were 25 men and 15 women, so that's 40 people in total. After an hour, 10 people left because 1/4 of 40 is 10. Now, if 22 men stayed, that means 3 men left because 25 minus 22 is 3. So, if 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, then 7 women must have left. 

So, if there were 15 women to start with and 7 left, then 8 women are still at the party.

"Well, let's see. Jam has 26 pencils, and 2 of them are just lying around, so the rest must be in the boxes. If she has 3 boxes, and 26 minus 2 is 24, then each box must have 8 pencils. 

Now, Meg has 46 pencils. If we add Jam's 26 pencils to Meg's 46 pencils, that's 72 pencils in total. If each box holds 8 pencils, then we need to figure out how many boxes we need for 72 pencils. 

72 divided by 8 is 9. So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"Well, let's see. Shannon's iced coffee gets cooled down by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees. So, she must be using 5 ice cubes, 'cause 65 divided by 13 is 5. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes would make it 60 milliliters weaker. She also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which makes it even weaker. So, the total amount the coffee gets weaker is 60 milliliters from the ice cubes plus 15 milliliters from the cream, which is 75 milliliters.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

So, Jaime works at a company with 100 people. Some are junior programmers, and some are senior programmers. The junior programmers get paid $2000 a month, and the senior programmers get paid $400 more than the junior programmers.

First, we need to figure out how many junior programmers there are. The problem says that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. So, we do:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. Since there are 100 people in total and 40 are junior programmers, the rest must be senior programmers:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we know the junior programmers get paid $2000 a month. So, the total amount paid to all junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers get paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so they get:

\[ \text{Salary for senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

So, the total amount paid to all senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers, we add the two totals together:

\[ \text{Total amount paid to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers each month.

\[
\boxed{224000}

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who's not too good with numbers, but I can figure things out step by step.

So, we start with some people getting on the bus at the terminal. We don't know how many, so let's call that number ""X.""

1. At the first stop, 5 more people get on. So now we have X + 5 people on the bus.
2. At the second stop, 7 people get off, and 8 more get on. So we take away 7 and add 8. That means we have (X + 5) - 7 + 8 people on the bus.

Now, we know that after all this, there are 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. So, we can set up the equation:

(X + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20

Let's simplify that:
X + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20
X + 6 = 20

Now, to find X, we subtract 6 from both sides:
X = 20 - 6
X = 14

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He gives 14 to his friends, so he has:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14, so he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
5. Adding the 28 lollipops he bought to the 8 he has left, he now has:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
6. He eats 3 lollipops that night, so he has:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
7. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31

So, Oscar has 31 lollipops left.

"Well, let's see. If the phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, that's 40% more to charge. Now, if it takes 3 minutes to charge 1%, then for 40%, it would be 40 times 3 minutes, which is 120 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 120 minutes is 2 hours. So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the customer spent $80 on their last trip. For every $20 they spend, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80, they get:

\[ 80 \div 20 = 4 \]

That means they got 4 dollars off for their next trip.

On this trip, they spent $43. They used their 4 dollars in rewards, and they had a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. So, the coupon took:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, let's add up the total discount:

\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \]

So, the total discount is 12 dollars. 

To find out how much they paid, we subtract the total discount from what they spent:

\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \]

So, the customer paid:

\[ 31 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

For Job A:
- Nick gets paid $15 an hour.
- He works 2000 hours a year.
- So, he makes \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars a year.
- The state takes 20% in taxes.
- So, the tax is \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars.
- After taxes, he has \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars left.

For Job B:
- Nick gets paid $42,000 a year.
- He has to pay $6,000 in property tax.
- So, after property tax, he has \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars left.
- The state takes 10% in taxes on what's left.
- So, the tax is \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars.
- After all taxes, he has \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars left.

Now, let's see how much more he makes at Job B:
- Job B: $32,400
- Job A: $24,000
- The difference is \( 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \) dollars.

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B.

"Well, let's see. There are 220 castles in Scotland, and 40 percent of them are ruins. So, we need to figure out what 40 percent of 220 is. 

40 percent of 220 is like saying 40 out of every 100, so:
\[ 220 \times 0.40 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Now, half of these ruined castles are unmanned. So, we need to find half of 88:
\[ 88 \div 2 = 44 \]

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"Well, let's see. For the Furniture United deal, you gotta pay $1,350 right away, and then 6 more payments of $350 each. So, that's $1,350 plus 6 times $350, which is $2,100. Add those together, and you get $3,450.

Now, for the Cozy Homes deal, you pay $1,100 right away, and then 9 more payments of $250 each. So, that's $1,100 plus 9 times $250, which is $2,250. Add those together, and you get $3,350.

To find out the difference, you just subtract the smaller total from the bigger one. So, $3,450 minus $3,350 is $100.

For the fudge, he needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch. So, if we add the sugar for the suckers and the fudge together, that's 240 plus 70, which equals 310 ounces. So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar.

"Well, let's see. Maria bought 8 shares for $8 each, so that's 8 times 8, which is $64. 

The first year, the price went up by 50%. So, each share that was $8 is now $8 plus half of $8, which is $4. So, each share is now $12. 

Now, with 8 shares at $12 each, that's 8 times 12, which is $96.

The next year, the price went down by 25%. So, each share that was $12 is now $12 minus a quarter of $12, which is $3. So, each share is now $9.

With 8 shares at $9 each, that's 8 times 9, which is $72.

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out on my own.

We have 200 students, and they are split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups ""x."" So, the smallest group has ""x - 10"" students.

Now, if we add up all the students in the three groups, it should equal 200:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we need to add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than 70:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

Now, if he runs 6000 meters every day for a whole month, and June has 30 days, then he runs 6000 meters times 30 days. That's 180,000 meters in June.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"Well, let's see. Davos bought 2 shirts, and each shirt costs $30. So, without any discount, he would pay 2 times $30, which is $60.

Now, there's a 40% discount. To figure out how much the discount is, we take 40% of $60. That's like saying 40 out of 100 parts of $60. So, 40% of $60 is $24.

To find out how much he actually paid, we take the total cost without the discount and subtract the discount. So, $60 minus $24 is $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"Well, let's see. When the factory made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 for each one. So, they made 10 times 100, which is $1000 a day.

Now, they make silos. They sell 5 silos a day and make $220 for each one. So, they make 5 times 220, which is $1100 a day.

To find out how much more they're making now, we take the new amount, $1100, and subtract the old amount, $1000. That's $1100 minus $1000, which is $100 more a day.

To figure out what percentage that is, we take the extra money, $100, and divide it by the old amount, $1000. That's 100 divided by 1000, which is 0.1. To make it a percentage, we move the decimal point two places to the right, so it's 10%.

- The treats cost $20 a month.
- The medicine costs $100 a month.

So, every month, she spends $100 on food, $20 on treats, and $100 on medicine. That's $100 + $20 + $100, which is $220 a month.

Now, to find out how much she spends in a year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12, because there are 12 months in a year. So, $220 times 12 is $2640.

Now, add all that up:
6 hours boatin' + 3 hours swimmin' + 6 hours watchin' shows = 15 hours.

The problem says that 15 hours is 30% of the time he spent on vacation. So, if 15 hours is 30%, then 100% (the total time) would be:
15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

John spent 40% of his time sightseein'. So, 40% of 50 hours is:

"Well, let's see. Annabelle wants a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 saved up. 

Now, she works two jobs. At the first one, she makes $10 an hour and works 20 hours, so that's:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

At the second job, she makes $5 an hour and works 15 hours, so that's:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, adding all that up, she has:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so she still needs:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

"Well, let's see. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The next one is 5 feet taller, so that makes it 11 feet tall. Now, if you add those two together, you get 17 feet. The tallest tree is supposed to be twice as tall as both of these trees put together, so that's 34 feet.

"Well, let's see. Dean's mom gave him $28 to go to the toy store. He bought 6 toy cars, and each one costs $2, so that's 6 times 2, which is $12. He also bought 5 teddy bears, and each one costs $1, so that's 5 times 1, which is $5. 

Now, if we add the cost of the cars and the teddy bears, that's $12 plus $5, which is $17. Dean had $28, and he spent $17, so he has $28 minus $17, which is $11 left.

Then, Dean's mom felt generous and gave him an extra $10. So, if he had $11 and got $10 more, that's $11 plus $10, which is $21.

"Well, let's see. Morgan's dad gave her $90 for her birthday party. She wants to play mini-golf, have some arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. 

- Mini-golf costs $5.
- Arcade tokens cost $5.
- Go-karts cost $10 each time, and she wants to ride it twice, so that's $20.

So, for one person, it costs $5 for mini-golf, $5 for arcade tokens, and $20 for the go-karts. That's $30 in total for one person.

Now, if Morgan has $90, and each person costs $30, she can have 3 people at the party. But that includes her, so she can invite 2 friends.

"Well, let's see. Marisa gets 5 dollars every day. She spends 25 cents on each lollipop, and she buys 4 of them. So, that's 25 cents times 4, which is 100 cents, or 1 dollar. So, she spends 1 dollar on lollipops each day. That means she saves 4 dollars each day. If she saves for 5 days, she saves 4 dollars times 5 days, which is 20 dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Billy had $10 to spend. He bought some candy that costs $1.50 per pound. After buying the candy, he had some money left over. He then spent half of that leftover money on gumballs, which cost 5 cents each. He bought 40 gumballs.

First, let's figure out how much he spent on the gumballs. Each gumball costs 5 cents, so 40 gumballs would cost:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his leftover money on gumballs, the total leftover money before buying gumballs was:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Billy had $4 left after buying the candy. This means he spent:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of candy he bought. The candy costs $1.50 per pound, so:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Well, let's see. Carver just turned 45, and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, if we add 5 to 45, we get 50. That means 50 is twice his son's age. If we split 50 in half, we get 25. So, his son must be 25 years old.

25"
"Well, let's see. The train goes from one city to another, and it does this a few times. First, it goes 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then it goes 50 miles less than the total of those two distances to get back to the first city. So, that's 75 plus 100, which is 175, and 50 less than that is 125 miles. 

So, for one big loop, the train goes 75 miles, 100 miles, and 125 miles. That's 300 miles in one big loop. The train does this 3 times a day, so that's 300 miles times 3, which is 900 miles a day.

Now, the train needs a check-up every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can go before it needs a check-up, we divide 18,000 miles by 900 miles a day. That's 18,000 divided by 900, which is 20.

So, the train can go 20 days before it needs a check-up.

"Well, let's see. I know a Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. Now, a collie bed takes the middle amount, which is 5 pounds, 'cause it's right in between 8 and 2.

If I need to make 4 chihuahua beds, that's 4 times 2 pounds, which is 8 pounds of stuffing.

For 3 collie beds, that's 3 times 5 pounds, which is 15 pounds of stuffing.

So, if I add 8 pounds for the chihuahua beds and 15 pounds for the collie beds, I get 23 pounds of stuffing in total.

23"
"Well, let's see. John's goin' to his friend's place, which is 200 miles away, but he had to take a detour that added 10 more miles. So, he drove 210 miles to get there. He was cruisin' at 70 miles an hour, so that's 210 miles divided by 70 miles an hour, which is 3 hours.

On the way back, he took a different route that was 240 miles long, and he was drivin' at 80 miles an hour. So, 240 miles divided by 80 miles an hour is 3 hours.

Add 'em up, 3 hours to get there and 3 hours to get back, that's 6 hours total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders at the school. Out of these, 43 are girls. So, to find out how many boys there are, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]
So, there are 53 boys in total.

On Friday, 4 boys were absent. To find out how many boys were at school on Friday, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
49"
"Well, let's see. If there are 6 girls and there's twice as many boys, that means there's 12 boys. So, if you add the girls and the boys together, that's 6 plus 12, which makes 18 kids in total.

18"
"Well, let's see. Jane needs to get at least 42 points in total to move up to the next grade. She already got 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. So, we need to add those up:

15 + 18 = 33

Now, we need to figure out how many more points she needs to reach 42. We can do this by subtracting the points she already has from the total points needed:

42 - 33 = 9

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

9"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

First, we know that 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks.

Next, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4 times the number of people who didn't wear masks, minus 5. So, that's:
\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Then, the number of people kicked out for fighting over stuff on sale is 3 times the number of shoplifters. So, that's:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add up all the people kicked out for these reasons:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 19 \]"
"Well, let's see. If Erin now has three times more points than Sara, and Sara has 8 points, that means Erin has 24 points now. But Erin just scored 14 points, so before that, she must have had 10 points.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

1. **Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - So, the total cost for the picture frames is \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

2. **Etching:**
   - Each picture frame needs to be etched, which adds 20% to the cost.
   - 20% of $20 is \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - So, the additional cost for etching is \( 44 \times 4 = 176 \) dollars.

3. **Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will get pins.
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the pins is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

4. **Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - 1/4 of 44 is \( 44 \div 4 = 11 \) seniors.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - So, the total cost for the cords is \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Add up all the costs: \( 880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \) dollars.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:
1198"
"Well, let's see. If the wallpaper costs $400 and I can save 20% by making it myself, that means I save $80. So, I just need to subtract that $80 from the $400. That makes it $320. So, if I make it myself, it costs me $320.

320"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person who knows how to count.

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of shoes.
2. **Saturday**: They sold double what they sold on Friday, so that's \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: They sold half of what they sold on Saturday, so that's \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. But 6 people returned their pairs, so the store actually sold \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) shoes.

"Well, let's see. Hallie practices dance on Tuesdays for 1 hour, on Thursdays for 2 hours, and on Saturdays, she practices for twice as long as on Tuesdays, which is 2 hours. So, if we add all that up:

1 hour on Tuesday + 2 hours on Thursday + 2 hours on Saturday = 5 hours

So, Hallie practices for 5 hours a week.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

The company bought equipment worth $400,000. But 40% of that equipment was faulty. 

First, we need to figure out how much the faulty equipment is worth:
40% of $400,000 is:
\[ 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

So, the faulty equipment is worth $160,000.

Now, we need to find out how much the good equipment is worth. We subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total:
\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the company spent $240,000 on the functioning pieces of equipment.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

1. There are 40 kids in the class.
2. Half of them like blue. So, 40 divided by 2 is 20. That means 20 kids like blue.
3. Now, we have 20 kids left. One-fourth of these 20 kids like green. So, 20 divided by 4 is 5. That means 5 kids like green.
4. The rest of the kids like yellow. We started with 40, 20 like blue, and 5 like green. So, 40 minus 20 minus 5 is 15.

So, 15 kids like yellow.

"Well, let's see. Lucy sells apples for $4 each. On Monday, she made $56, so she must have sold 14 apples because 56 divided by 4 is 14. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked twice as many as Tuesday, so that's 24 apples. 

Now, if we add up all the apples she picked over the three days, it's 14 on Monday, 12 on Tuesday, and 24 on Wednesday. That's 14 plus 12 plus 24, which equals 50 apples.

"Well, let's see. Lindsay had 50 socks to wash. She washed 10 pairs, which is 20 socks, and 15 more loose socks. So, she washed 20 plus 15, which is 35 socks. If she had 50 socks and washed 35, then she must have missed 15 socks.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way. Karan borrowed $3,650 for 5 months at an interest rate of 10%. We need to figure out how much she has to pay back each month.

First, we need to find out how much interest she has to pay. The interest is 10% of the amount she borrowed, but only for 5 months. 

10% of $3,650 is:
\[ 3,650 \times 0.10 = 365 \]

But this is for a whole year. Since she only borrowed it for 5 months, we need to find out what 5 months of interest is:
\[ 365 \times \frac{5}{12} = 152.08 \]

So, the total interest for 5 months is about $152.08.

Now, we add this interest to the amount she borrowed:
\[ 3,650 + 152.08 = 3,802.08 \]

This is the total amount she needs to pay back. Since she has to pay it back in 5 equal monthly payments, we divide the total by 5:
\[ 3,802.08 \div 5 = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay about $760.42 each month.

760.42"
"Well, let's see. Cho hiked for 8 hours at 14 kilometers each hour. So, that's 14 times 8, which is 112 kilometers. Chloe hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers each hour. So, that's 9 times 5, which is 45 kilometers. 

To find out how much farther Cho hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. So, 112 minus 45 is 67 kilometers.

"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 100 silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together:
- Silver pesos: 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150 silver pesos
- Gold pesos: 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200 gold pesos

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:
150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350 pesos

"Well, let's see. Millie spent 18 bucks on stuff to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher makes 12 cups, so that's 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for a dollar, so if she sells all 36 cups, she makes 36 dollars. 

Now, to find out how much she makes after paying for the stuff, we take the 36 dollars she made and subtract the 18 dollars she spent. That leaves her with 18 dollars in profit.

She sells 4 cups an hour, so to sell all 36 cups, it takes her 36 divided by 4, which is 9 hours.

To find out how much she makes per hour, we take the 18 dollars in profit and divide it by the 9 hours. That's 18 divided by 9, which is 2 dollars per hour.

So, Millie makes 2 dollars per hour.

"Well, let's see. If Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and has 12.8 hectares left, that means the 12.8 hectares is the 2/5 part of his land that he didn't sell. 

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1/5 of his land is, and then multiply that by 5 to get the total.

12.8 hectares is 2/5, so 1/5 would be half of 12.8, which is 6.4 hectares.

Now, if 1/5 of his land is 6.4 hectares, then all of his land (which is 5/5) would be 5 times 6.4 hectares.

So, 5 times 6.4 is 32 hectares.

Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Well, let's see. The choir has 52 people, and half of them are girls, so that's 26 girls. On the day of the performance, only half of the girls could come because their bus broke down, so that's 13 girls. Then, 3 teachers joined in to help out. So, if you add those 3 teachers to the 13 girls, you get 16 people who sang in the performance.

"Well, let's see. Wilson got these scores on his tests: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74. To find out his math grade, we need to add all these numbers up and then divide by how many tests there are, which is 5.

So, 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400.

Now, we divide 400 by 5:
400 รท 5 = 80.

So, Wilson's math grade is 80.

A third of 66 is 22. So, James gives 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

Now, to find out the total, we just add the messages together:
66 + 22 = 88

So, James delivers a total of 88 messages.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way.

David and Dasha went to the carnival, and they both want to ride all 9 rides. 

For Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- So, each ride costs 2 tickets ร $2 = $4.
- For 9 rides, Dasha will pay 9 rides ร $4 = $36.

For David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which lets him ride all 9 rides.

Now, let's see how much David saves:
- Dasha pays $36.
- David pays $30.

She's got 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all these gifts. If we want to know how much ribbon she can use for each bow, we need to split that 144 inches evenly among the 12 gifts. So, 144 divided by 12 is 12. 

Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"Well, let's see. If Betty and Sam have popsicles in a ratio of 5 to 6, and they have 165 popsicles together, we can figure out how many each has by breaking it down.

First, we add the parts of the ratio: 5 + 6 = 11 parts in total.

Now, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts to find out how many popsicles each part is worth:
165 รท 11 = 15 popsicles per part.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has:
5 ร 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts, so he has:
6 ร 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's:
90 - 75 = 15.

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Well, let's see. Tim had a cable package that cost him $60 a month. Now, he's getting Netflix for $10 a month. For Hulu and Disney Plus, he gets a deal where he saves 20% on both. So, each one normally costs $10, which would be $20 for both. But with the 20% off, he saves $4 (20% of $20), so he pays $16 for both.

Now, add up what he's paying for all the streaming stuff:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu and Disney Plus: $16

That's $26 in total for the streaming services.

So, if he was paying $60 for cable and now he's paying $26 for streaming, he's saving:
$60 - $26 = $34

He saves $34 a month.

"Well, let's see. Carol spent 4 hours writing a song, which is 240 minutes. She spent half that time recording it, so that's 2 hours, or 120 minutes. She also spent 90 minutes editing it. 

Now, to find out what part of her total time she spent editing, we add up all the time she spent:
- Writing: 240 minutes
- Recording: 120 minutes
- Editing: 90 minutes

Total time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

To find out what percentage of her total time she spent editing, we take the time spent editing (90 minutes) and divide it by the total time (450 minutes), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, 90 / 450 = 0.2, and 0.2 * 100 = 20%.

Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

She gave out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. That's 29 cards she gave out.

So, she had 50 cards and gave out 29, which leaves her with 21 cards.

Then, she got 17 cards from her family and friends. So, she now has 21 cards plus 17 cards, which makes 38 cards.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"Okay, let's see. Jenny's got a pizza with 12 slices. She gives some to Bill and some to Mark, and then she eats a couple herself. We need to figure out how many slices are left.

First, Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. That's 12 slices divided by 3, which is 4 slices for Bill.

Then, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. That's 12 slices divided by 4, which is 3 slices for Mark.

So, Bill gets 4 slices and Mark gets 3 slices. That's 4 + 3 = 7 slices given away.

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, 7 slices given away plus 2 slices eaten by Jenny is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

Now, we started with 12 slices. If 9 slices are gone, then 12 - 9 = 3 slices are left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how much flour and milk Mark needs for his quadruple batch of brownies.

- The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
- For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times that amount.

So, for flour:
- 3 cups ร 4 = 12 cups of flour.

For milk:
- 1 cup ร 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Now, let's figure out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk he needs to buy.

- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
- To get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs 12 รท 2 = 6 bags of flour.

- Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
- To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs 4 รท 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.

- He needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.
- So, 6 - 2 = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Mel uses an air conditioner that uses 900 watts of power. He uses it for 8 hours a day. If he cuts down the time by 5 hours, he'll only use it for 3 hours a day.

First, let's figure out how much power he uses in a day when he uses the AC for 8 hours:
900 watts ร 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

Now, if he uses it for only 3 hours:
900 watts ร 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours

The difference in power usage per day is:
7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours

To find out how much he saves in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
4500 watt-hours/day ร 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours

Since 1000 watt-hours is the same as 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh), we convert the savings to kilowatt-hours:
135,000 watt-hours รท 1000 = 135 kWh

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

"Well, let's see. I got two zebras with 17 stripes each, that's 34 stripes. Then there's a zebra with 36 stripes, and another one with half of 36, which is 18 stripes. So, if I add all those stripes up, I get 34 + 36 + 18, which is 88 stripes in total. Now, I've got 4 zebras, so I divide 88 by 4 to find out the average. That gives me 22 stripes per zebra.

"Alright, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

First, we need to know how many sandwiches we gotta make. There are 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people. So, we divide 20 by 4:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]
We need 5 sandwiches.

Next, each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So for 5 sandwiches, we need:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

Now, let's figure out the cost. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound. So:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the costs together:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we know that Allan has 40 cannolis. The problem says he has twice as much corn as cannolis. So, if he has 40 cannolis, he must have:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns} \]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis. So now he has:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis} \]

The problem also says he buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has now. So, he buys:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of corns and cannolis he has. He has 100 cannolis and 60 corns, so:

\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ 160 \]"
"Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He already did half of that, which is 5,000 steps, going to and from school. Then, he walked another 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

So, let's see how many steps he did during his jog. He had 6,000 steps before the jog (5,000 from school and 1,000 with his friend). He had 2,000 steps left after the jog. So, he must have done 2,000 steps during his jog to make up the difference.

2000"
"Well, let's see. Toby's book is 45 pages long, and each page has about 200 words. So, the book has 45 times 200 words, which is 9000 words. Toby can read 300 words in a minute, so it'll take him 9000 divided by 300, which is 30 minutes to read the whole book.

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to leave 10 minutes before his 60 minutes are up, which means he has 50 minutes to read. If he finishes reading in 30 minutes, he'll have 50 minus 30, which is 20 minutes left.

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

In May, the company hired 40 people. Each person worked 40 hours a week and got paid $15 an hour. There are 4 weeks in a month, so each person worked 160 hours in May. 

To find out how much one person got paid in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 160 \, \text{hours} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since there were 40 people:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/person} \times 40 \, \text{people} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

In June, 1/4 of the people's contracts ended, so 3/4 of the people stayed. That means:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{people} \]

Each of these 30 people also worked 160 hours in June, so:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 160 \, \text{hours} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

For 30 people:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/person} \times 30 \, \text{people} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount paid in both months:
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the company paid a total of:
\[ 168000 \]"
"Well, let's see. Sally got 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound was $3, and the second one was half off, so that's $1.50. So, for the taffy, she paid $3 + $1.50, which is $4.50.

She also bought a bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 little magnets. Each magnet was $0.25, so 4 magnets would be $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up: $4.50 for the taffy, $1.50 for the seashells, and $1.00 for the magnets. That's $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00, which is $7.00.

Sally started with $10. If she spent $7.00, then she has $10 - $7.00 left, which is $3.00.

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"Well, lemme think this through step by step, like I'm countin' my chickens.

First, Tim buys a pack of fireworks for $400. Then he buys another pack that's twice as much, so that's $800. Add 'em up, and that's $1200.

Now, he gets a 20% discount on these. Twenty percent of $1200 is $240. So, he saves $240, which means he only pays $1200 - $240 = $960 for the fireworks.

Lastly, he buys a finale firework for $150. Add that to the $960, and he spends a total of $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, Tim spent $1110 in total.

"Well, let's see. Shannon eats 2 cookies every night, right? And she wants to have enough for 30 days. So, if we do the math, 2 cookies times 30 days, that's 60 cookies she needs. Now, a dozen is 12 cookies, so to find out how many dozens she needs, we divide 60 by 12. That gives us 5. So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out myself.

Marcy makes 50,000 candles. She says they are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% might explode. 

First, let's find out how many candles might explode:
1% of 50,000 is:
\[ 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

So, 500 candles might explode.

Now, we know that 5% of the candles that might explode also smell like wet dog. So, we need to find 5% of 500:
\[ 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

So, 25 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Misha picked out 4 blouses, and each blouse usually costs $20. But these blouses are on a 30% off rack. So, we need to find out how much each blouse costs after the discount.

First, let's find out how much 30% of $20 is:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

So, each blouse is $6 cheaper. Now, let's subtract that from the original price:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Each blouse now costs $14. Misha picked out 4 blouses, so we need to multiply the discounted price by 4:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Well, let's see. Joanne picked 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short trees, so that's 15 apples. Her sister picked twice as many from the tall trees, so that's 60 apples, and three times as many from the short trees, which is 45 apples. They didn't pick any from the middle trees, just Joanne did.

Now, if they picked 500 apples in total, we need to figure out how many Joanne picked from the middle trees. Let's add up what we know:

- Joanne: 30 (tall) + 15 (short) = 45 apples
- Sister: 60 (tall) + 45 (short) = 105 apples

Together, they picked 45 + 105 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees. So, the rest must be from the middle trees, which Joanne picked.

500 - 150 = 350 apples

So, Joanne picked 350 apples from the middle trees.

"Well, let's see. We got 180 heads and 304 bumps. Camels got two bumps, and dromedaries got one bump. 

If all of 'em were dromedaries, we'd have 180 bumps, 'cause each one's got one bump. But we got 304 bumps, which is 124 more bumps than if they were all dromedaries. 

So, those extra 124 bumps must be from the camels, and since each camel has 2 bumps, we divide 124 by 2 to find out how many camels there are. That gives us 62 camels.

Now, if there are 62 camels, and we know there are 180 heads in total, we can figure out how many dromedaries there are by subtracting the number of camels from the total number of heads. So, 180 minus 62 is 118.

But wait, I made a mistake. If we have 124 extra bumps, and each camel has 2 bumps, that means there are 124 / 2 = 62 camels. So, the number of dromedaries is 180 - 62 = 118.

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"Well, let's see. Tom went on a big trip in Europe for two weeks. Here's how it went:

- For the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers each day. So, that's 200 times 4, which is 800 kilometers.
- Then, for the next 2 days, he only traveled 30% of what he did in the first 4 days. So, 30% of 800 is 240 kilometers.
- On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so that's 0 kilometers.
- In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days. So, that's 300 times 7, which is 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

So, the total distance is 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100, which is 3140 kilometers.

"Well, let's see. There were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and took 5 cats each. That's 4 times 5, which is 20 cats. So, 50 minus 20 leaves us with 30 cats still on the rock.

Then, 3 out of every 5 of those 30 cats ran after a mouse. To figure out how many that is, we can split 30 into 5 equal parts, which gives us 6 cats per part. Three parts would be 6 times 3, which is 18 cats.

So, if 18 cats ran after the mouse, we take the 30 cats that were left and subtract the 18 that ran off. That leaves us with 12 cats still on the rock.

"Well, let's see. Bill signed up for this streaming service, and the first 6 months cost him $8 each month. So, for 6 months, that's 6 times 8, which is 48 dollars.

Then, for the next 8 months, it went up to $12 a month. So, 8 times 12 is 96 dollars.

After that, the price went up again to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and he already paid for 14 months, he has 10 more months to pay. So, 10 times 14 is 140 dollars.

Now, we add all that up: 48 plus 96 plus 140. That's 284 dollars.

"Well, let's see. Cole bought some jeans, and he saved some money. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less, so they cost $22. He saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans, which is $2. The rest, $4, he saved from the tattered jeans.

Now, if he saved $4 on the tattered jeans, they must have originally cost $28 + $4 = $32. And if he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, they must have originally cost $22 + $2 = $24.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $24, and the tattered jeans originally cost $32. The difference is $32 - $24 = $8.

For the big buses: 4 buses times 60 people each, that's 240 people.
For the smaller buses: 6 buses times 30 people each, that's 180 people.
For the little vans: 10 vans times 15 people each, that's 150 people.

3 feeders ร 20 birds each = 60 birds

For the homemade feeders:
3 feeders ร 30 birds each = 90 birds

Now, add 'em up:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out myself.

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and he has $50 left over. So, he must have made $150 in total from selling his Pokemon cards.

He sells each card for $1.5. So, to find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money he made by the price per card:

\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

But Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so he only sold 2/3 of his cards. If 100 cards are 2/3 of his total cards, we can find the total number of cards he started with by:

\[ \text{Total cards} = \frac{100}{2/3} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"Okay, let's think about this like a simple person who knows how to count but doesn't know fancy math.

The caterer was told to make enough hot dogs for 36 people. He made enough for half of them to have two hot dogs and the other half to have one hot dog.

So, for 18 people, he made 2 hot dogs each:
18 people * 2 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs

For the other 18 people, he made 1 hot dog each:
18 people * 1 hot dog = 18 hot dogs

In total, he made:
36 hot dogs + 18 hot dogs = 54 hot dogs

But then, 40 people showed up, and each one wanted 2 hot dogs:
40 people * 2 hot dogs = 80 hot dogs

The caterer only had 54 hot dogs, so he was short:
80 hot dogs - 54 hot dogs = 26 hot dogs

Since each person needs 2 hot dogs, 26 hot dogs short means 26 people didn't get their second hot dog.

So, the number of guests who didn't get a second hot dog is:

5 utensils * $5 each = $25

Now, we add up all the items:
$120 (pots and pans) + $20 (mixing bowls) + $25 (utensils) = $165

The clerk said everything was 20% off. To find out how much 20% off is, we do:
$165 * 20% = $33

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. **How much money did George have left?**
   - George had $5 to start with.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which is 1% of $5.
   - 1% of $5 is \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars.
   - So, George had $0.05 left.

2. **How much did George spend?**
   - If he had $0.05 left, he must have spent \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

3. **How much did the chips cost?**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40.
   - So, the total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

4. **How much did he spend on candy bars?**
   - He spent a total of $4.95.
   - He spent $1.20 on chips.
   - So, the amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

5. **How many candy bars did he buy?**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.
   - To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: \( 3.75 \div 0.75 = 5 \).

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person who knows how to count and add.

1. **Onions:**
   - The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but Antoine likes to double that.
   - So, he uses 2 pounds ร 2 = 4 pounds of onions.
   - Onions cost $2.00 per pound.
   - So, 4 pounds ร $2.00 = $8.00 for the onions.

2. **Beef Stock:**
   - He needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - Each box costs $2.00.
   - So, 2 boxes ร $2.00 = $4.00 for the beef stock.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Add the cost of the onions and the beef stock.
   - $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00 total.

4. **Cost per Serving:**
   - The soup serves 6 people.
   - To find the cost per serving, divide the total cost by the number of servings.
   - $12.00 รท 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

So, the cost per serving is $2.00.

"Okay, let's think about this like a simple problem.

Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater. Bernadette's drive is four times longer, so it takes her \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes to get there.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. So, if Wayne arrives at the theater at a certain time, Bernadette needs to be there 5 minutes before that.

If Wayne takes 4 minutes to get there, he leaves 4 minutes before the time he wants to arrive. Bernadette needs to leave 16 minutes before the time she wants to arrive, which is 5 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette needs to leave 16 minutes before Wayne's arrival time, and Wayne leaves 4 minutes before his arrival time. That means Bernadette needs to leave 16 - 4 = 12 minutes before Wayne, plus the extra 5 minutes to arrive before him.

So, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes before Wayne.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we know the area of Billie's bedroom is 360 square feet. The length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, 3 yards is 9 feet.

Now, to find the width, we use the area formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]

To find the width, we divide 360 by 9:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"Well, let's see. Elizabeth got herself 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Each pack has 20 beads, so that's 20 beads for the red pack and 40 beads for the two clear packs. Add those up, and Elizabeth has 60 beads.

Now, Margareth, she got 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack still has 20 beads, so that's 60 beads for the blue packs and 80 beads for the red packs. Add those up, and Margareth has 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we just subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads. So, 140 beads minus 60 beads equals 80 beads.

80"
"Well, let's see. Marcus's house starts out at 40 degrees. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven makes it 5 degrees hotter. So, 3 hours times 5 degrees is 15 degrees hotter. That means the house is now 40 degrees plus 15 degrees, which is 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, which means it cools down 2 degrees times 3, that's 6 degrees cooler.

So, if the house was 55 degrees and it cools down 6 degrees, the final temperature is 55 degrees minus 6 degrees, which is 49 degrees.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Jon did the triathlon in:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes)
- Run: 50 minutes

So, Jon's total time is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's figure out how long it took James:
- James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, if Jon took 40 minutes, James took:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

- James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, if Jon took 80 minutes, James took:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

- Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time was:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took James to run. We know his total time and the time for the swim and bike:
\[ 36 + 85 + \text{Run time} = 180 \]
\[ 121 + \text{Run time} = 180 \]
\[ \text{Run time} = 180 - 121 \]
\[ \text{Run time} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"Well, let's see. Movie C is 1.25 hours long. That's the same as 75 minutes, 'cause 1.25 times 60 is 75. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so that makes Movie B 80 minutes long. Now, Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, if you take 80 and divide it by 4, you get 20. So, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

20"
"Well, let's see. If the horse runs 32 miles in an hour, in 30 minutes, which is half an hour, it would run half of 32 miles. So, that's 16 miles.

Now, for every mile the horse runs, it eats half a bail of hay. So, for 16 miles, it would eat 16 times half a bail, which is 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails would cost 8 times 3, which is 24 dollars.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has 6 times 5, which is 30 dollars.

If he spends 24 dollars on hay, he would have 30 minus 24, which is 6 dollars left.

So, Michael has 6 dollars left after buying the hay.

"Well, let's see. Rozanne's got 4 dozen eggs from the cases, and that's 48 eggs 'cause a dozen is 12. She also found 2 more eggs in the cupboard. So, she's got 50 eggs in total. Now, if each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, then she can make 10 glasses of eggnog. If each tray holds 5 glasses, then she can put out 2 trays. 

2"
"Well, let's see. Joey had 214 points, and he got 26 more. So, 214 plus 26 is 240. Marcy had 225 points and got 10 more, so 225 plus 10 is 235. Now, to find out how many points Joey is winning by, we take Joey's points and subtract Marcy's points. So, 240 minus 235 is 5. 

Joey is winning by 5 points.

5"
"Well, let's see. The salesman bought a bunch of sneakers, 48 of 'em, for $576. That means each sneaker cost him $576 divided by 48, but we don't really need to know that to figure out his profit.

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at a flash sale. So, 17 times 20 is 340 dollars. That's what he made from the flash sale.

Then, he sold the rest, which is 48 minus 17, so that's 31 sneakers, to a department store for $25 each. So, 31 times 25 is 775 dollars.

Now, to find out how much he made in total, we add what he made from the flash sale and what he made from the department store. That's 340 plus 775, which is 1115 dollars.

To find out his profit, we take what he made in total and subtract what he spent to buy the sneakers. So, 1115 minus 576 is 539 dollars.

So, the salesman's profit is 539 dollars. 

539"
"Well, let's see. Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons. Six of 'em had eight crayons each, and the other four had sixteen crayons each. 

First, we figure out how many crayons are in the six packets with eight crayons:
6 packets times 8 crayons each equals 48 crayons.

Then, we figure out how many crayons are in the four packets with sixteen crayons:
4 packets times 16 crayons each equals 64 crayons.

Now, we add 'em up:
48 crayons plus 64 crayons equals 112 crayons.

So, Beatrice bought 112 crayons in all.

112"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out.

So, you can buy a super ticket for $20, and that includes a movie and a popcorn with a soda for just $1 extra. That means the total for the super ticket is $21.

Now, if you don't buy the super ticket, you pay $12 for the movie ticket, $3 for the soda, and some amount for the popcorn. Let's call the price of the popcorn ""P.""

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. So, the total cost without the super ticket should be $2 less than $21.

So, the equation is:
12 (movie ticket) + 3 (soda) + P (popcorn) = 21 - 2

That simplifies to:
15 + P = 19

Now, to find P, we subtract 15 from both sides:
P = 19 - 15
P = 4

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"Well, let's see. First, I need to figure out how much it cost to fill one balloon before the price went up. If 20 balloons cost $900, then each balloon must have cost:

\[
900 \div 20 = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, the price went up by $20 for each balloon. So, the new price for each balloon is:

\[
45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at this new price. So, the total cost for 170 balloons would be:

\[
170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Bentley paid:

\[
11050

"Well, let's see. The car went 60 miles an hour for 2 hours, so that's 120 miles. Then it went 30 miles an hour for 1 hour, so that's 30 more miles. All together, the car went 150 miles. It took 3 hours to do this. To find the average speed, you take the total miles and divide by the total hours. So, 150 miles divided by 3 hours is 50 miles an hour.

50 mph"
"Well, let's see. Jenna starts with 8 shiny blue stones, and each one of those is worth 800 dollars. So, all together, her blue stones are worth 8 times 800, which is 6400 dollars.

Then, she trades 3 of her blue stones for 2 red stones. The 3 blue stones she traded are worth 3 times 800, which is 2400 dollars. The 2 red stones she got are each worth 1200 dollars, so together they are worth 2 times 1200, which is also 2400 dollars.

After the trade, she has 5 blue stones left and 2 red stones. The 5 blue stones are worth 5 times 800, which is 4000 dollars. The 2 red stones are still worth 2400 dollars.

So, all her stones together are worth 4000 plus 2400, which is 6400 dollars.

"Well, let's see. Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy eats 4 apples a day too. So together, they eat 8 apples a day. If we want to know how many apples they eat in 30 days, we just need to multiply 8 apples by 30 days.

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

So, they eat 240 apples in 30 days."
"Well, let's see. Bob's got 10 raised beds, and each one is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To figure out how much soil he needs, we gotta find out how much space each bed takes up. That's just multiplying the width, length, and height together.

So, for one bed:
2 feet wide ร 8 feet long ร 2 feet tall = 32 cubic feet of soil.

Since he's got 10 beds, we multiply that by 10:
32 cubic feet ร 10 = 320 cubic feet of soil.

Now, each bag of soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we need to figure out how many bags that is:
320 cubic feet รท 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
160 bags ร $12 per bag = $1920.

So, Bob will need to spend $1920 on potting soil.

1920"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting things out.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards. That's easy enough to remember.
2. **Green Cards**: It says there are 60% more green cards than red cards. So, if there are 15 red cards, 60% of 15 is 9 (because 15 times 0.60 is 9). So, there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the same as the total number of red and green cards together. So, 15 red cards + 24 green cards = 39 yellow cards.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

So, the total number of cards is 78.

78"
"Well, let's see. Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then, her friend saw half as many, which is 25 more fairies. So, that makes 75 fairies all together. But then, 30 fairies flew away. So, if we take 30 away from 75, we get 45 fairies left.

45"
"Well, let's see. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. So, we got 8 plus 12, which is 20 puppies in total. Now, for the spotted ones, we got 3 plus 4, which makes 7 spotted puppies.

To find out what percentage of the puppies have spots, we take the number of spotted puppies, which is 7, and divide it by the total number of puppies, which is 20. Then we multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, 7 divided by 20 is 0.35. Multiply 0.35 by 100, and you get 35.

So, 35% of the puppies have spots.

35%"
"Well, let's see here. The farmer's got a bunch of stuff to haul:

- He's got 2 little boxes of sugar cubes, and each box is 1 pound. So, that's 2 pounds.
- Then, he's got 4 big bags of carrots, and each bag is 12 pounds. So, that's 48 pounds.
- He's also got 42 bales of hay, and each bale is 75 pounds. So, that's 3150 pounds.
- Lastly, he's got 20 sacks of oats, and each sack is 65 pounds. So, that's 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add all that up:
2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. So, we need to figure out how many trips it'll take to haul 4500 pounds.

4500 pounds divided by 2250 pounds per trip is 2 trips.

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to get all the feed to his farm.

"Well, let's see. Grayson drinks 3 cans of soda and 5 bottles of water every week. Each can is worth 2 cents, and each bottle is worth 3 cents.

First, we figure out how much the cans are worth:
3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents

Then, we figure out how much the bottles are worth:
5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents

Now, we add the value of the cans and bottles to get the total for one week:
6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Since we want to know how much Grayson earns in a four-week month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
21 cents * 4 weeks = 84 cents

So, Grayson earns 84 cents in a four-week month.

84"
"Well, let's see. If Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more than Frederick, that means Toni has 10 plus 6 more, which is 16 plants. Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, if Toni has 16, Shondra must have 16 minus 7, which is 9 plants.

"Well, let's see. Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards. So, that's 6 times 25, which is 150 basketball cards. She also has five boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards. So, that's 5 times 40, which is 200 baseball cards.

Now, if we add the basketball cards and the baseball cards together, we get 150 plus 200, which is 350 cards in total.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives away 350 minus 50, which is 300 cards.

If each student gets 10 cards, then the number of students is 300 divided by 10, which is 30.

So, Miss Maria has 30 students.

30"
"Well, let's see. Becky bought 20 apples, and each one cost her 45 cents. So, 20 times 45 cents is 900 cents, which is 9 dollars. But she got a dollar off, so she paid 8 dollars.

Kelly also bought 20 apples, but each one cost her 50 cents. So, 20 times 50 cents is 1000 cents, which is 10 dollars. But she got a 10 percent discount. Ten percent of 10 dollars is 1 dollar, so she paid 9 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid, we just subtract what Becky paid from what Kelly paid. So, 9 dollars minus 8 dollars is 1 dollar.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs, which is 60 more shoes. So, he adds up 10 + 30 + 60, that's 100 more shoes. Now he has 200 + 100, which is 300 shoes. But on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, 300 - 180, that leaves him with 120 shoes on Sunday.

Now, if each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we need to figure out how many pans that would be. So, we take 48 cupcakes and divide 'em by 12 cupcakes per pan. That gives us 4 pans. So, Mary needs to bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Theo bought a pen for $2. That's easy to remember.

Now, the piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. So, three times the price of the pen is 3 times 2, which is 6. Then, $1 less than 6 is 5. So, the paper costs $5.

Now, we add the cost of the pen and the paper together: $2 for the pen and $5 for the paper, which gives us $7 in total.

Theo gave the cashier $10. So, to find out how much change she got, we subtract the total cost from what she gave: $10 - $7 = $3.

So, Theo got $3 in change.

"Well, let's see. There are 30 kids in the class, and each one had 10 pencils at the start. So, that's 300 pencils in total.

After two months, they used up 1/5 of all the pencils. So, they used 60 pencils, because 300 divided by 5 is 60. That leaves 240 pencils.

By the end of the year, only 1/3 of those 240 pencils were left. So, 240 divided by 3 is 80.

So, at the end of the year, there were 80 pencils left.

"Alright, let's figure this out. Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. 

So, if Matt eats \( c \) carrot sticks, he can have \( \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \) cookies. We need to find out how many carrot sticks \( c \) he needs to eat to get 5 cookies.

Let's set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

First, we need to get rid of the 2 on the right side. We do this by subtracting 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Now, to find \( c \), we need to get rid of the \(\frac{1}{2}\). We do this by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"Well, let's see. The shark is 10 feet long. Each of those little fish, the remoras, is 6 inches long. There are two of them, so that's 6 inches plus 6 inches, which is 12 inches. Now, 12 inches is the same as 1 foot. So, the little fish together are 1 foot long.

To find out what part of the shark they are, we take the 1 foot of the little fish and divide it by the 10 feet of the shark, and then we multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So, 1 divided by 10 is 0.1, and 0.1 times 100 is 10.

So, the little fish are 10% of the shark's length.

"Well, let's see. Jason wants to break in his new shoes, and he's got 240 minutes to do it. He can walk 4 days a week, and he's got 3 weeks to get ready for the track team. 

First, we figure out how many days he can walk in 3 weeks. That's 3 weeks times 4 days a week, which gives us 12 days.

Now, we need to split those 240 minutes over 12 days. So, we take 240 minutes and divide it by 12 days. That's 240 divided by 12, which equals 20.

So, Jason needs to walk 20 minutes each day.

So, if we add 9 and 6, that's 15. But we gotta take away the 3 that got counted twice, so that leaves us with 12 kids who are allergic to something.

Now, if there are 32 kids in total and 12 are allergic, then 32 minus 12 is 20. So, 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

"Well, let's see. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and the 2010 penny is three-quarters of that, we need to figure out what three-quarters of 48 grains is. 

Three-quarters is the same as 3 out of 4, so we can divide 48 by 4 to get 12, and then multiply 12 by 3 to get 36. So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, to find the total weight, we just add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny together:
48 grains + 36 grains = 84 grains.

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

Both players can hold up to 100 songs. So, Gabriel can add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ more songs} \]

And Luri can add:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ more songs} \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Stetson and Alec made a bet. Stetson said he'd give up $10 for each orange he eats. They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them.

First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. If they picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, we can do the math:

2/5 of 60 is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Now, for each orange he ate, he gives up $10. So, for 24 oranges, he gives up:
\[ 24 \times 10 = 240 \]

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

"Well, lemme think 'bout this. If Jillian's shoes cost $80, and her handbag cost $20 less than three times the cost of her shoes, we gotta do some simple math. Three times the cost of her shoes is 3 times 80, which is 240. Now, if the handbag is $20 less than that, we take 240 and subtract 20. So, 240 minus 20 is 220. 

So, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

Over five days, that's 200 pounds of oats. Since each bag has 50 pounds, he needs 4 bags to feed his horses for five days.

"Well, let's see. Jana has 27 puppies, and two out of every three of them are Pomeranians. So, if we split 27 into three parts, each part would be 9. Two of those parts are Pomeranians, so that's 18 Pomeranians.

Now, one out of every three of these Pomeranians is a girl. So, if we split 18 into three parts, each part would be 6. That means there are 6 girl Pomeranians.

"Well, let's see. We got three places, and we need to find the average of the highest temperatures they ever had.

Southlandia had a high of -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
Northlandia had a high of 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
Midlandia had a high of -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

To find the average, we add these numbers up and then divide by 3, because there are three places.

-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now, we divide -30 by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

So, the average highest temperature of these three places is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

"Well, let's see. Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. So, if we put 24 eggs on one tray and 24 eggs on the other tray, that's 48 eggs in total. 

Now, if Jaime has 64 eggs and he puts 48 on the trays, he's gonna have some left over. To find out how many, we just need to take 64 and subtract 48. 

64 - 48 = 16

So, Jaime won't be able to put 16 eggs on the trays.

"Well, let's see. Sally bought one small pizza for $8. The big family pizza costs 3 times that, so it's 3 times 8, which is 24 dollars. So, if you add the small pizza and the big pizza together, that's 8 plus 24, which makes 32 dollars in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. **Cost of Razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - There are 4 razors in each pack.

2. **Sale:**
   - The razors are on sale for ""buy one get one free.""
   - This means if you buy one pack, you get another pack for free.

3. **What Heather Buys:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs, but because of the sale, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - So, she pays $4.00 for 2 packs.

4. **Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After using the coupon, the total cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

5. **Total Razors:**
   - Each pack has 4 razors, and she gets 2 packs.
   - So, she gets 4 razors + 4 razors = 8 razors.

6. **Cost per Razor:**
   - She paid $2.00 for 8 razors.
   - To find the cost per razor, divide $2.00 by 8.
   - $2.00 รท 8 = $0.25 per razor.

7. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is the same as 25 cents.

So, the cost per individual razor after all the discounts is:

"Well, let's see. We got 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and 1 cheerleader who is 60 inches tall. They're building a pyramid, with 4 on the bottom, 3 on top of them, 2 on top of those, and the shortest one at the very top.

So, the bottom layer with 4 girls:
4 girls ร 64 inches = 256 inches

The next layer with 3 girls:
3 girls ร 64 inches = 192 inches

The next layer with 2 girls:
2 girls ร 64 inches = 128 inches

And the top girl:
1 girl ร 60 inches = 60 inches

Now, we add all these up:
256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches

To turn inches into feet, we divide by 12:
636 inches รท 12 = 53 feet

So, the human pyramid is 53 feet tall.

"Well, let's see. Charisma works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute walk every hour. So, she walks 5 minutes, 8 times a day. That's 40 minutes a day. If she does this for 5 days, then she walks 40 minutes each day for 5 days. That's 200 minutes total.

"Well, let's see. Brett is 14 years old right now. In four years, he'll be 18. The problem says that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, three times 14 is 42. That means in four years, Angela will be 42. So, right now, Angela must be 42 minus 4, which is 38.

"Well, let's see. Paul drives his car twice every day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for 14 days. 

In the morning, he spends about $6 each time. So for 14 days, that's 14 times $6, which is $84.

In the afternoon, he spends about $2 each time. So for 14 days, that's 14 times $2, which is $28.

Now, if we add the morning and afternoon costs together, $84 plus $28, that gives us $112.

So, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"Well, let's see. Ashley brought 5 boxes, and each box has 10 oranges, so that's 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so that's 70 oranges. Together, they have 50 oranges plus 70 oranges, which is 120 oranges. If one pie needs 3 oranges, then they can make 120 divided by 3, which is 40 pies.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Mark is trying to decide between two places for a surprise party. The first place costs $200 no matter how many people come, but he has to pay $5 for each person for food. The second place costs $25 for each person, and that includes the food.

We need to find out how many people need to come for both places to cost the same.

Let's break it down:

1. For the first place:
   - It costs $200 plus $5 for each person.
   - If 1 person comes, it costs $200 + $5 = $205.
   - If 2 people come, it costs $200 + $10 = $210.
   - If 3 people come, it costs $200 + $15 = $215.
   - And so on...

2. For the second place:
   - It costs $25 for each person.
   - If 1 person comes, it costs $25.
   - If 2 people come, it costs $50.
   - If 3 people come, it costs $75.
   - And so on...

We need to find the number of people where both costs are the same. Let's try a few numbers:

- If 10 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (10 * $5) = $200 + $50 = $250
  - Second place: 10 * $25 = $250

So, when 10 people come, both places cost the same.

The number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"Well, let's see. Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects all together. Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found. 

If we say David found \( D \) insects, then Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects, and Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. 

So, if we add them all up:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

That's:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Now, we need to find \( D \):
\[ 4D = 43 - 7 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David:
\[ 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Lily found 16 insects.

"Well, let's see. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. If we put those together, that's 1/4 plus 1/2. Now, 1/2 is the same as 2/4, so that means they used 3/4 of a skein together.

Now, if a whole skein has 364 yards, then 3/4 of it would be 3/4 times 364. To figure that out, you can just do 364 divided by 4, which is 91, and then multiply that by 3. So, 91 times 3 is 273.

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Well, let's see. Cherrie's got 5 friends. Two of 'em want 5 gifts each, so that's 10 gifts right there. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 6 more gifts. Then, Cherrie decides to surprise 'em with 10 more random gifts. So, if we add 'em all up:

10 gifts for the first two friends + 6 gifts for the other three friends + 10 surprise gifts = 26 gifts.

Cherrie bought 26 gifts in total.

"Well, let's see. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. She got 2 packs of strawberry, 1 pack of grape for $2, and 1 pack of green apple for half of that, so $1. She paid $7 in total.

So, if we add up the grape and green apple, that's $2 + $1 = $3. That means the rest of the money, $7 - $3 = $4, must have gone to the strawberry gum. Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry, each pack must have cost $4 / 2 = $2.

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy trying to make the most popsicle sticks.

1. **What I know:**
   - I can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood.
   - I can get 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood.
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6.
   - I have $24 to spend.

2. **What I need to do:**
   - I want to get the most sticks possible with my $24.

3. **Let's break it down:**
   - If I buy 2 x 4 pieces of wood:
     - Each piece costs $4.
     - I can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces.
     - Each piece gives me 200 sticks.
     - So, 6 pieces will give me \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

   - If I buy 2 x 8 pieces of wood:
     - Each piece costs $6.
     - I can buy \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces.
     - Each piece gives me 400 sticks.
     - So, 4 pieces will give me \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Buying 2 x 8 pieces of wood gives me more sticks.
   - But the question asks for the most sticks if I buy the cheapest lumber.
   - The cheapest lumber is the 2 x 4 pieces.

So, if I buy the cheapest lumber, I can get 1200 sticks.

"Well, let's see. Mario's got 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. So, that's 6 dogs times 4 legs, which is 24 legs. Now, each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, so we need 24 legs divided by 2 legs per pair, which gives us 12 pairs of snowshoes. If each pair costs $12.00, then 12 pairs times $12.00 is $144.00.

144"
"Well, let's see. Janet takes two bus rides every day, and she does this for five days a week. So, that's 2 rides times 5 days, which gives us 10 rides in a week. Each ride costs her $2.20. So, for 10 rides, she'd pay 10 times $2.20, which is $22.00.

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass, it costs $20.00. So, if she usually pays $22.00 and the pass is $20.00, she saves $2.00 by getting the pass.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

The farm has 30 cows. That's a lot of cows!

The zoo has 20 sheep. That's a bunch of sheep!

Now, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. So if the farm has 30 cows, the zoo must have 60 cows. That's a whole lot of cows!

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. So if the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have 10 sheep. That's a fair number of sheep.

Now, let's add up all the animals:

- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so that's 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so that's 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"Well, let's see. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, and she bought 4 times what Sophia bought, then we need to figure out what Sophia bought.

For the onions:
- If 12 onions is 4 times what Sophia bought, then Sophia must have bought 12 divided by 4, which is 3 onions.

For the potatoes:
- If 4 potatoes is 4 times what Sophia bought, then Sophia must have bought 4 divided by 4, which is 1 potato.

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. Adding them together, Sophia bought a total of 3 + 1 = 4 items.

"Well, let's see. Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, which is on July 19th. Today is December 31st. That's a lot of days, but we need to figure out how many exactly.

First, let's count the days:
- January has 31 days, but we start on the 31st, so that's 31 days.
- February has 28 days (or 29 if it's a leap year, but we'll keep it simple).
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 19 days up to the 19th.

Now, let's add them up:
31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. So, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:
105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of 525 calories each day to reach his goal.

525"
"Well, let's see. Gerald gets $30 for each day he works. He works for 7 days, so that's 7 times $30, which is $210. He spent $100, so if we take that away from what he made, he has $210 minus $100 left. That means he has $110 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Hannah's gym teacher wants her to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 kilometers. So, first, we need to find out how many kilometers she will run in total.

8 laps times 0.25 kilometers per lap:
8 x 0.25 = 2 kilometers

Now, Hannah needs to drink 60 milliliters of water for each kilometer she runs. So, for 2 kilometers, she will need:

2 kilometers times 60 milliliters per kilometer:
2 x 60 = 120 milliliters

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

Then, she spent 25% of what's left on CDs. That's like taking 25 out of every 100, so for 400, it's 100 bucks again. 

So, after buying the CDs, she's left with 300 bucks.

"Okay, let's think about this. The house and the lot together cost $120,000. The house costs three times as much as the lot. So, if we say the lot costs $30,000, then the house would cost three times that, which is $90,000. Add them together, and you get $120,000.

So, the house costs $90,000.

"Well, let's see. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so that's 40 bags. Each pack cost her $4, so 8 packs would be 8 times 4, which is $32. She then sold each bag for $8, so 40 bags times 8 dollars is $320. To find out how much she made, we take the money she got from selling the bags and subtract the money she spent. So, $320 minus $32 is $288. That's the profit she made.

Now, if Joe throws 25 punches every minute, and the fight lasts 15 minutes, we just multiply those two numbers:

25 punches per minute times 15 minutes equals 375 punches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my money in my pocket.

First, Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, let's count that:
- Four $10 bills: 4 times 10 is 40 dollars.
- Six $20 bills: 6 times 20 is 120 dollars.

Now, add those together:
- 40 dollars + 120 dollars = 160 dollars.

Ali gives half of this to his sister:
- Half of 160 dollars is 80 dollars.

So, after giving 80 dollars to his sister, Ali has:
- 160 dollars - 80 dollars = 80 dollars left.

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining 80 dollars to buy dinner:
- 3/5 of 80 dollars is 48 dollars.

So, after buying dinner, Ali has:
- 80 dollars - 48 dollars = 32 dollars.

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

- 12 balls for a sweater,
- 1 ball for a pair of mittens,
- 2 balls for a pair of socks.

So, for one kid, that's 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2, which is 21 balls of yarn. Since I got 3 grandkids, I need 21 times 3, which is 63 balls of yarn.

On Tuesday, he does 3 times as many as he did on Monday. That's:
3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, he has:
88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he does one-quarter of the remaining problems. That's:
52 / 4 = 13 problems.
So, he has:

4. A grocery store gave back 6 loaves.

First, we take the 200 loaves and subtract the 93 loaves sold in the morning:
200 - 93 = 107 loaves left.

Next, we subtract the 39 loaves sold in the afternoon:
107 - 39 = 68 loaves left.

Finally, we add the 6 loaves that were returned:
68 + 6 = 74 loaves left.

So, they had 74 loaves of bread left.

Now, for the cookies, she needs 3/4 of a cup for each batch. To figure out how many batches she can make, we need to see how many times 3/4 goes into 9.

If 3/4 is one batch, then 4/4 (which is 1 cup) would be 4/3 of a batch. So, 9 cups would be:

9 cups ร 4/3 = 12 batches

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Ada uses 12 kilowatts of electricity every hour. That's like using a lot of big lights or a big TV. Now, she wants to add a new thing that uses 2 more kilowatts every hour.

First, let's figure out how much Ada pays for electricity now:
- She uses 12 kilowatts per hour.
- Each kilowatt costs $1.50.
- So, for one hour, she pays 12 * 1.50 = $18.

Now, let's see how much more she will pay with the new thing:
- The new thing uses 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Each kilowatt costs $1.50.
- So, for one hour, the new thing costs 2 * 1.50 = $3.

Now, let's add the cost of the new thing to what she already pays:
- Current cost per hour: $18
- New thing cost per hour: $3
- Total cost per hour: $18 + $3 = $21

Next, we need to find out how much more she will pay in a week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Current weekly cost: $18 * 7 = $126
- New weekly cost: $21 * 7 = $147

Finally, let's find the difference:
- New weekly cost: $147
- Current weekly cost: $126
- Difference: $147 - $126 = $21

So, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:

"Well, let's see. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, that means it takes them 10 days to paint a whole house, right? Now, if 5 people work together, they should be able to do it a lot faster. 

If one person takes 10 days, and there are 5 people, then it should take them 10 days divided by 5 people, which is 2 days. But we need to figure out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is 2 times 24, which is 48 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas. The problem says she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if she has 20 sofas, she must have 22 chairs. (Because 20 + 2 = 22)

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, if Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has 3 times that, which is 66 chairs. (Because 22 ร 3 = 66)

3. The problem also says Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Jenna has 66 chairs, she must have 64 sofas. (Because 66 - 2 = 64)

4. Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs:
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
   - Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.

5. Total sofas: 20 (Ophelia) + 64 (Jenna) = 84 sofas
6. Total chairs: 22 (Ophelia) + 66 (Jenna) = 88 chairs

7. Total number of sofas and chairs: 84 + 88 = 172

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"Well, let's see. Tom bought a CD for $4 and something else, and he paid $48 in total. So, if we take away the $4 he spent on the CD, that leaves $44 for the headphones. Now, if he didn't buy the headphones, he could use that $44 to buy more CDs. Since each CD costs $4, he could buy:

$44 รท $4 = 11 more CDs.

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he didn't get the headphones.

"Well, let's see. Josh was working out for 8 weeks. Most of the time, he did 4 hours a week. But there were some weeks where he did more.

He did 5 hours for two weeks, and 6 hours for one week. So, let's count it all up:

- For 5 weeks, he did 4 hours each week. That's 5 weeks times 4 hours, which is 20 hours.
- For 2 weeks, he did 5 hours each week. That's 2 weeks times 5 hours, which is 10 hours.
- For 1 week, he did 6 hours. That's just 6 hours.

Now, we add all these up:
20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

So, Josh worked out for a total of 36 hours over the 8 weeks.

3. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. That's 5 times 8, which is 40 people. So, 40 + 40 = 80 people are now on the bus.
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, 80 - 21 = 59 people are left.
5. Then, 3 times fewer people get on. That means 21 divided by 3, which is 7 people. So, 59 + 7 = 66 people are now on the bus.

So, after the second stop, there are 66 people on the bus.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. So, right now, Jame is 27 minus 5, which is 22 years old.
2. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 plus 8, which is 30 years old.
3. The problem says that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, twice Jame's age in 8 years is 30 times 2, which is 60. Five years younger than 60 is 55.
4. If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then right now, the cousin is 55 minus 8, which is 47 years old.
5. So, the difference in their ages right now is 47 minus 22, which is 25 years.

The number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"Well, let's see. Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100, and the printer cost $400 less than the computer, so that's $700 for the printer. Now, if we add the computer and the printer, that's $1,100 + $700, which is $1,800. So, the 2 monitors together cost $2,400 - $1,800, which is $600. Since there are 2 monitors, one monitor costs $600 divided by 2, which is $300.

300"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just a regular person who's trying to figure it out.

So, we have twenty kids, and they're split into two equal groups of girls and boys. That means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys each brought back 60 seashells. Now, the girls brought back the same number of seashells as the boys, plus four times as many. 

Let's break it down:
- Each boy brought 60 seashells.
- Each girl brought 60 seashells (the same as the boys) plus 4 times 60 seashells.

So, for each girl:
- 60 (same as the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many)
- 60 + 240
- That's 300 seashells.

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"Well, let's see. Chenny is 10 years old. If Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, that means Alyana is 6 years old. Now, if Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, then Anne must be 8 years old.

"Well, let's see. The first book is 31 mm thick. The second one is 50 mm. The third one is 5 mm less than the second, so that's 45 mm. The fourth one is twice as thick as the first, so that's 62 mm.

Now, to find the total thickness, we add 'em all up:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62

That's:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"Well, let's see. Emma wants to make 72 vlogs in a month. She's already made 18 in the first week, 21 in the second week, and 15 in the third week. So, we add those up:

18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, to find out how many more she needs to make, we take her goal of 72 and subtract the 54 she's already done:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to hit her goal.

"Well, let's see. The dinner cost $50, and my wife wants me to pay an extra 20% for a tip. First, I need to figure out what 20% of $50 is. That's like saying 20 out of 100, so it's 20/100 times 50, which is $10. So, the tip is $10.

Now, the total bill with the tip is $50 plus $10, which is $60. My wife wants to split the $50 bill, so I pay half of that, which is $25. But I also have to pay the whole tip, which is $10.

So, I end up paying $25 for my half of the bill plus $10 for the tip, which is $35.

"Well, let's see. If $18 is shared among 3 boys, each one gets $6. The eldest boy gets his $6, and he adds $5 to it, so he has $11. The next day, he adds another $10, so now he has $21. Then, he spends $8, leaving him with $13. After that, he triples what he has left, so he ends up with $39.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so the month is split into two halves of 15 days each.

In the first half, Elvis saves a certain amount each day. Let's call this amount ""x"" dollars per day. So, in the first 15 days, he saves 15x dollars.

In the second half, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day as he did in the first half. So, he saves 2x dollars per day. Over the second 15 days, he saves 15 * 2x = 30x dollars.

Now, we add the savings from both halves to get the total savings for the month:
15x + 30x = 45x

We know the total savings should be $1125, so:
45x = 1125

To find x, we divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis saves 25 dollars each day in the first half. In the second half, he saves twice that amount:
2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day.

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."
"Well, let's see. Verna bought some fruits, right? She got three apples, and each one costs $1.50. So, for the apples, she paid 3 times $1.50, which is $4.50.

Then, she bought five oranges, and each orange is $0.80. So, for the oranges, she paid 5 times $0.80, which is $4.00.

Lastly, she got six peaches, and each peach is $0.75. So, for the peaches, she paid 6 times $0.75, which is $4.50.

Now, let's add all that up: $4.50 for the apples, $4.00 for the oranges, and $4.50 for the peaches. That's $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50, which is $13.00 in total.

Verna gave $20.00, so to find out how much change she got, we subtract the total cost from what she gave: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

So, Verna got $7.00 in change.

$7.00"
"Okay, let's see. Jairus gets 80 cents for each task, and Jenny gets 50 cents for each task. If they both finish 20 tasks, we need to figure out how much more Jairus makes.

First, let's find out how much Jairus makes:
80 cents times 20 tasks is 1600 cents, which is 16 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much Jenny makes:
50 cents times 20 tasks is 1000 cents, which is 10 dollars.

To find out how much more Jairus makes, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total:
16 dollars minus 10 dollars is 6 dollars.

So, Jairus gets 6 dollars more than Jenny.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Jeff and Brad are splitting 100 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

If Brad gets \( B \) dollars, then Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. Together, they have 100 dollars, so:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

That's the same as:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much Brad gets, we divide 100 by 5:

\[ B = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Jeff gets 80 dollars.

80"
"Well, let's see. Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day. That's 6 miles a day. If he does this 5 days a week, then he walks 6 miles times 5 days. That's 30 miles in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

1. Elise writes the whole alphabet twice. The alphabet has 26 letters, so:
   26 letters ร 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so:
   13 letters.

3. Now, she writes everything she has already written again. She has already written 52 letters plus 13 letters, which is:
   52 + 13 = 65 letters.

4. So, she writes all 65 letters again, which means:
   65 letters.

Adding it all up:
52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters.

So, Elise has written 130 letters in total.

3. **Third Round**: Each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so that's 9 times 3, which is 27 families.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so that's 27 times 3, which is 81 families.

So, during the fourth round, 81 families will be notified.

"Well, let's see. Mark was sick for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. So, he lost 30 pounds in total. If he ended up weighing 70 pounds, then before he got sick, he must have weighed 70 pounds plus the 30 pounds he lost. That means he weighed 100 pounds at first.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, let's add up the cost of all the stuff Daniel wants to buy:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: 5 ร 1.50 = $7.50
- Two pens at $0.25 each: 2 ร 0.25 = $0.50
- One calculator at $12.00: 1 ร 12.00 = $12.00
- One geometry set at $10.00: 1 ร 10.00 = $10.00

Now, let's add all these up:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on everything. So, we need to figure out what 10% of $30.00 is:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 ร 30.00 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

So, Daniel has to spend:
$27.00

"Well, lemme see now. Carly's buyin' some food and drinks for her friends. She's gettin' five of them big ol' hamburgers, and each one costs 4 dollars. So, 5 times 4 is 20 dollars for the burgers.

Then, she's gettin' ten packs of them crispy fries, and each pack is 30 cents. So, 10 times 30 cents is 3 dollars for the fries.

Lastly, she's grabbin' five cans of fruit drinks, and each can is 2 dollars. So, 5 times 2 is 10 dollars for the drinks.

Now, let's add it all up: 20 dollars for the burgers, 3 dollars for the fries, and 10 dollars for the drinks. That's 20 plus 3 plus 10, which is 33 dollars in total.

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to figure out how much change she gets back. Fifty dollars minus 33 dollars is 17 dollars.

So, Carly gets 17 dollars back.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about money.

First, we need to break down how much Antonella made from her sales. She sold goods worth $2500. 

1. For the first $1000, she gets a 30% commission. So, we calculate 30% of $1000:
   \[
   1000 \times 0.30 = 300
   \]
   So, she earns $300 for the first $1000.

2. For the rest of the sales, which is $1500 (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500), she gets an additional 10% commission. So, we calculate 10% of $1500:
   \[
   1500 \times 0.10 = 150
   \]
   So, she earns $150 for the additional $1500.

3. Now, we add the two amounts together to find out her total earnings:
   \[
   300 + 150 = 450
   \]

So, Antonella earned $450.

"Well, let's see. Bill's got 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he's got:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He's got 70 guests, and he wants each guest to have 2 bottles. So, he needs:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, he already has 48 bottles, so he needs to buy:

140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

"Well, let's see. When the water's cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When it's warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when it's cold. So, that's 2 minutes more than 32 minutes, which is 34 minutes.

Now, for 3 miles in cold water, it would be 3 times 16 minutes, which is 48 minutes. For 3 miles in warm water, it would be 3 times 34 minutes, which is 102 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes in warm water, we subtract the cold water time from the warm water time: 102 minutes minus 48 minutes, which is 54 minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles in warm water than in cold water.

21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes.

Now, let's count the holes:
- For the 7 buttons with two holes: 7 buttons times 2 holes each = 14 holes.
- For the 14 buttons with four holes: 14 buttons times 4 holes each = 56 holes.

Now, we add 'em up:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're just talking it through.

First, we know Mark weighs 150 pounds. That's easy enough.

Now, Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. So, we take Mark's weight and subtract 20:
150 - 20 = 130 pounds. So, Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Next, Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. So, we take Susan's weight and double it:
130 x 2 = 260 pounds. So, Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, to find the average weight, we add up all their weights and then divide by 3, because there are 3 people.

So, we add:
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

Then we divide by 3:
540 รท 3 = 180 pounds.

So, the average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds.

Now, each pack of candles has 5 candles and costs $3. To get 20 candles, James needs 4 packs because 20 divided by 5 is 4. 

So, if each pack costs $3 and he needs 4 packs, he spends 4 times 3, which is $12.

"Well, let's see. In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. That's 15 minutes times 7 nights, which is 105 minutes. Now, if she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we need to figure out how many pages she reads in 105 minutes. 

To do that, we can say that in 1.5 minutes, she reads 2 pages. So, in 1 minute, she reads about 1.33 pages (2 divided by 1.5). If we multiply 1.33 pages by 105 minutes, we get about 140 pages for the first week.

In the second week, she read 100 pages. So, if we add the 140 pages from the first week to the 100 pages from the second week, we get 240 pages.

So, Judy read 240 pages in two weeks.

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

The problem says that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we call the nephew's age in 7 years \( N + 7 \), then:

\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):

\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

So, if we add it all up: $5.00 for the first tooth, $3.00 for the next three, and $1.00 for the last two, that's $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00.

With $20, he can buy:
$20 รท $5/figure = 4 wooden action figures

Now, he has:
$70 - $20 = $50 left

If we look at a month, which is about 4 weeks, the shops would want 65 roses times 4, which is 260 roses. Ford can only give them 40 roses times 4, which is 160 roses. 

So, Ford is short by 260 minus 160, which is 100 roses.

4. If she takes out $100 each month for 24 months, she takes out:
   \[

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way:

- The food truck buys bread for $3.00 a loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
- They also spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
- So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.
- They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so for 10 sandwiches, they make 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.
- To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total money they made: $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \]

If she sells each crayon muffin for $1.50, then the total money she can make is:

"Well, let's see here. Michael's room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so that's 216 square feet. Now, the new carpet costs $12 a square foot, so that's 216 times 12, which is $2,592. The padding is $2 a square foot, so that's 216 times 2, which is $432. To take out the old carpet, it's $4 a square foot, so that's 216 times 4, which is $864. And to put in the new carpet, it's $34 a square foot, so that's 216 times 34, which is $7,344.

Now, if we add all that up: $2,592 for the carpet, $432 for the padding, $864 to take out the old carpet, and $7,344 to put in the new carpet, we get:

$2,592 + $432 + $864 + $7,344 = $11,232

So, it's gonna cost Michael $11,232 to replace the carpet.

$11,232"
"Well, let's see. Mack counted birds for a whole week. Here's what he saw:

- On the first two days, he saw 50 birds in total.
- On the third day, he didn't see any birds.
- On the fourth and fifth days, he saw 120 birds in total.
- On the sixth day, he saw 20 birds.
- On the seventh day, he saw 90 birds.

Now, to find out how many birds he saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds and then divide by the number of days.

So, let's add up the birds:
50 (first two days) + 0 (third day) + 120 (fourth and fifth days) + 20 (sixth day) + 90 (seventh day) = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
280 birds รท 7 days = 40 birds per day

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds each day.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way:

1. Diane starts with the number 20.
2. She adds half of 20 to it. Half of 20 is 10, so 20 + 10 = 30.
3. She then divides 30 by 5, which gives 6.
4. Next, she takes the starting number, 20, and subtracts 12 from it, which gives 8.
5. Finally, she multiplies 6 by 8, which gives 48.

So, the final value of the number train is 48.

"Well, let's see. The boy got 5 cards. His brother has 3 less than him, so that means his brother has 2 cards. If we put their cards together, that's 5 and 2, which makes 7 cards in total.

"Well, let's see. If Maggie's oven is set to 450, it actually gets to 468. That's 18 degrees too hot. So, it's going a bit over, right? 

Now, if she wants it to be 520, we need to figure out how much less she should set it to get the right temperature. 

If 450 gives us 468, that means for every 450 degrees, it goes up by 18. So, for 520, we need to find out how much less she should set it to get the right temp.

Let's do it step by step:

1. First, we find out what percentage 18 is of 450:
   \[
   \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%
   \]
   So, the oven is 4% too hot.

2. Now, if we want the oven to be 520, we need to set it to a temperature that, when it goes 4% over, will be 520.

3. Let's call the temperature she should set it to \( x \). So, \( x \) plus 4% of \( x \) should equal 520:
   \[
   x + 0.04x = 520
   \]
   \[
   1.04x = 520
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
   \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to get it to 520.

"Well, let's see. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes. That's 90 minutes, 'cause 1 hour is 60 minutes, and 60 plus 30 is 90. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes. That's 125 minutes, 'cause 2 hours is 120 minutes, and 120 plus 5 is 125. Now, if you add 90 and 125, you get 215 minutes. So, it'll take Max 215 minutes to watch both movies.

"Well, let's see. Herb's house is worth $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less than that. 

To figure out 30% of $76,000, I'll do this:
\[ 76,000 \times 0.30 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is $22,800 less than Herb's. That means:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find out how much both houses are worth together, I add them up:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Well, let's see. Judy bought 12 cups and twice as many dishes, so that's 24 dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 44 dishes. 

Now, let's add it all up:
- Judy's stuff: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils
- Her friend's stuff: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils

So, together they brought:
36 + 84 = 120 utensils

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how much 2 boxes of contacts cost with the discount. Each box is $100, but there's a 10% discount. So, 10% of $100 is $10. That means each box costs $100 - $10 = $90.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is $90 x 2 = $180.

Now, each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have 90 x 2 = 180 contacts.

Pete uses 2 contacts a day, so 180 contacts mean he has 180 / 2 = 90 pairs of contacts.

To find out how much each pair costs, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs: $180 / 90 = $2.

So, each pair of contacts costs $2.00.

2.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So, Jill worked a total of:
2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked:
2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked:
3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday

So, John worked a total of:
4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, they both get paid $10 an hour. So, Jill earned:
3 hours * $10/hour = $30

And John earned:
7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
$70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how many calories Hannah burns. She does aerobics for 2 hours, and that burns 500 calories each hour. So, for 2 hours, that's:
500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories

Then, she runs for 1 hour, and that burns 600 calories. So, for 1 hour, that's:
600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we need to find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories. We can do this by dividing the total calories by 200 and then multiplying by 100 ml:
1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

800 ml"
"Well, let's see. The jar has a total of 4500 jelly beans, and it says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones. 

If we say the number of blue jelly beans is 1500 (because 4500 divided by 3 is 1500, and it makes the math easier), then:

- The red jelly beans would be 1% less than 1500, which is 1500 minus 15 (1% of 1500), so 1485 red jelly beans.
- The green jelly beans would be 1% more than 1500, which is 1500 plus 15 (1% of 1500), so 1515 green jelly beans.

So, if there are 1515 green jelly beans and 1485 red jelly beans, the difference is 1515 minus 1485, which is 30.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Jared starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, he gets better and can type 52 WPM. If he keeps improving and adds another 5 WPM, his new speed will be:

52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we need to find the average of these three speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add all the numbers together and then divide by how many numbers there are. So:

47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Now, we divide 156 by 3 (since there are 3 numbers):

156 รท 3 = 52

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

"Well, let's see. If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he'd lose:
1.25 pounds/week ร 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

But if he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he'd gain:
1.75 pounds/week ร 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, to find out the difference, we add the weight he'd lose to the weight he'd gain:
6.25 pounds + 8.75 pounds = 15 pounds

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts is 15 pounds.

"Well, let's see here. Alex is inviting 100 people by email, and each of those folks is bringing 2 friends. So, that's 100 people plus 200 friends, which makes 300 people. Then, she calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses. That's 10 friends plus 8 spouses, which makes 18 more people. 

So, if we add all that up, 300 people from the email plus 18 people from the phone calls, Alex will need 318 seats.

"Well, let's see. The first dog, the Affenpinscher, weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund next to it is twice as heavy, so that's 20 pounds. The Papillon is a lot lighter, only a quarter of the Dachshund's weight, so that's 5 pounds. The big Mastiff at the end is 44 times heavier than the Papillon, so that's 44 times 5, which is 220 pounds.

- On the second day, it's 8 feet times 2, so it's 16 feet.
- On the third day, it's 16 feet times 2, so it's 32 feet.

So, on the third day, the beanstalk is taller than Mark's window. It takes 3 days.

So, if we say he was 5 years old 5 years ago, that would make him 10 years old now. Because 5 times 2 is 10. 

Now, if he's 10 years old now, in 3 years, he'll be 10 plus 3, which is 13.

"Well, let's see. George needs 2 implants, and each one costs $2000. So, for both, that's $4000. One of those implants needs a fancy crown that costs an extra $500. So, the total cost is $4000 plus $500, which is $4500.

George already paid $600, so he still needs $4500 minus $600, which is $3900.

George makes $15 an hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide $3900 by $15. That's 260 hours.

So, George needs to work 260 hours.

"Well, let's see. I know that all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. If one angle is twice the smallest angle, and another is three times the smallest angle, we can figure it out like this:

Let's say the smallest angle is \( x \) degrees. Then the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees. So, we have:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

That's the same as:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Now, to find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The largest angle, which is three times the smallest, is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So, the largest angle is 90 degrees.

"Well, let's see. Colby's got some coins, and he wants to buy gumballs that cost a nickel each. 

First, let's count up all his money:
- He's got 8 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, so that's 8 times 25, which is 200 cents.
- Then he's got 6 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 6 times 10, which is 60 cents.
- He's also got 14 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 14 times 5, which is 70 cents.
- Lastly, he's got 15 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent, so that's 15 cents.

Now, let's add all that up:
- 200 cents from the quarters
- 60 cents from the dimes
- 70 cents from the nickels
- 15 cents from the pennies

So, 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents in total.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide 345 by 5 to find out how many gumballs he can buy:
- 345 รท 5 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

For the cats: 2 cats times 4 legs each, that's 8 legs.
For the birds: 10 birds times 2 legs each, that's 20 legs.

And every Christmas, he got 5 more games, and that happened 3 times, so that's 15 more games.

Now, let's add 'em up:
5 (birthday) + 12 (first year) + 24 (second year) + 48 (third year) + 15 (Christmases) = 104 games.

So, Steve has 104 games after 3 years.

So, he has:
$92 - $16 = $76 left.

On Wednesday, he spends four times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is:
4 ร $16 = $64.
So, he has:
$76 - $64 = $12 left.

So, Howard has $12 left.

"Well, let's see. For the first four hours, Patrick was sellin' 15 cups of lemonade each hour at 50 cents a cup. So, that's 15 cups times 50 cents, which is 7.50 dollars an hour. He did that for 4 hours, so 7.50 times 4 is 30 dollars.

Then, for the next two hours, he sold 10 cups an hour at 60 cents a cup. So, that's 10 cups times 60 cents, which is 6 dollars an hour. He did that for 2 hours, so 6 times 2 is 12 dollars.

Now, we add the money from both parts: 30 dollars plus 12 dollars, which gives us 42 dollars.

So, Patrick made 42 dollars from sellin' lemonade for 6 hours.

"Well, let's see. If the tires turn 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we need to figure out how many times the tires turn in a month. 

First, we find out how many 2-mile stretches are in 400 miles:
\[ 400 \div 2 = 200 \]

So, the tires turn 725 times for each of those 200 stretches:
\[ 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \]

That's how many times the tires turn in one month. Now, we need to know how many times they turn in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \]

The tires can handle 10,440,000 turns before they need to be replaced. So, we need to find out how many years it takes to reach that number:
\[ 10,440,000 \div 1,740,000 = 6 \]

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"Well, let's see. The big bottle of shampoo costs $24.00, and it says you get 120 washes if you use 2 pumps each time. But Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash. So, if 2 pumps give 120 washes, 1 pump would give twice as many washes, right? That's 240 washes.

Now, to find out how much each pump costs, we take the total cost and divide it by the number of pumps. So, $24.00 divided by 240 pumps. That's 10 cents per pump.

The store is having a 30% off sale. So, Joe only has to pay 70% of the total price. 

To find out how much 70% of $60 is, we do this:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

So, Joe will pay $42 for the outfit.

Now, we subtract the amount Joe spends from the $50 he has:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

Now, for Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long, it would cost:

490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to fix Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

So, it costs $65,960 more to fix Lewis' street.

His research took 10 times longer than those 5 months, so that's 50 months in total. After the first 5 months, he needed 50% more money each month. So, instead of $20,000, he needed $30,000 each month for the next 45 months.

For the first 5 months, he spent $100,000. For the next 45 months, he spent $30,000 each month, which is $1,350,000. So, the total cost of his research is $100,000 + $1,350,000, which is $1,450,000.

"Well, lemme see now. Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale. That's a good deal! Then she went to the pet store and bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, so that's 2 times $2.50, which is $5.00. She also got 3 pieces of coral, and each piece was $2.00, so that's 3 times $2.00, which is $6.00. She bought 20 fish, and each fish was $0.50, so that's 20 times $0.50, which is $10.00. Lastly, she needed fish food, which cost $2.00.

First, we need to know how many street lights are at one intersection. Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, we do the math:
4 street lights per pole ร 6 poles = 24 street lights at one intersection.

Next, we need to find out how many street lights are on the whole road. There are 4 intersections, so:
24 street lights per intersection ร 4 intersections = 96 street lights in total.

But we know that 20 of these street lights are not working. So, we need to subtract those from the total:
96 total street lights - 20 non-working street lights = 76 working street lights.

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"Well, let's see. The first DVD can be played 1000 times, and it's already been played 356 times. So, it can be played 1000 minus 356 more times, which is 644 times.

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times, and it's been played 135 times. So, it can be played 1000 minus 135 more times, which is 865 times.

Now, if we add the times both DVDs can still be played, that's 644 plus 865, which gives us 1509 times.

So, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 more times before they break.

1509"
"Well, let's see. John had to go to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and he went twice a week. Each time he went, he spent 2 hours there. Now, if each hour costs $125, we need to figure out how much all that time added up to.

First, let's count the total number of times he went:
- 6 weeks times 2 times a week is 12 times.

Next, let's figure out the total hours:
- 12 times times 2 hours each time is 24 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much 24 hours cost:
- 24 hours times $125 per hour is $3000.

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

3000"
"Well, let's see. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. He chews 1 piece every 2 hours at school, and school lasts 8 hours, so that's 4 pieces. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces. So, he chews 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces in total.

Now, he started with 20 pieces, and he chewed 6, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left. But then he gives half of what's left to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, at the end of the day, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left.

"Well, let's see. If Charmaine will be 16 in 12 years, that means right now she's 4 years old. If we want to know how old she'll be in 4 years, we just add 4 to her current age. So, 4 plus 4 is 8.

"Well, let's see. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs, and each one costs $3. So, he spent 9 times 3, which is $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs, and each one costs $14. So, he spent 8 times 14, which is $112.

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we take the basketball coach's total and subtract the baseball coach's total. That's $112 minus $27, which is $85.

85"
"Well, let's see. Arianna's got a garden with 10 rows, and each row has 20 flowers. So, that's 10 times 20, which is 200 flowers in total. Now, if only 4 out of every 5 flowers have bloomed, that means 4/5 of 200. To figure that out, you take 200 and divide it by 5, which gives you 40. Then, you multiply 40 by 4, which gives you 160. So, 160 flowers have bloomed.

160"
"Well, let's see. Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. That's like saying she can download 20 little bits of data every second. 

Now, to figure out how much she can download in an hour, we need to know how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 3600 seconds in an hour.

If she can download 20 kb every second, then in 3600 seconds, she can download \(20 \times 3600 = 72000\) kb.

But we need to know how many Mb that is. Since 1 Mb is 1000 kb, we divide 72000 by 1000 to get the answer in Mb.

So, \(72000 \div 1000 = 72\) Mb.

Ashleyโs internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

72"
"Well, let's see. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, that's 10 cars times 3 days, which gives us 30 cars.

Now, for the last four days, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day. So, that's 10 cars minus 4 cars, which is 6 cars each day. For four days, that's 6 cars times 4 days, which gives us 24 cars.

Add the cars from the first three days and the last four days together: 30 cars plus 24 cars, and that makes 54 cars in total.

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
54"
"Well, let's see. The roller coaster needs you to be 4 feet tall, and that's 48 inches because 1 foot is 12 inches. Adam is 40 inches tall right now. He needs to grow 8 more inches to be 48 inches tall. If he grows 2 inches every year, then he needs 4 years to grow 8 inches. So, Adam will be tall enough in 4 years.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

James sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000. So, the total money from selling the cars is:
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

Now, the company had to pay 30% of the price to get each car. So, for each car, they paid:
30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500

For 10 cars, the company paid:
10 cars * $7,500 = $75,000

The profit is the total money from selling the cars minus what the company paid to get the cars:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:
10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500.

$17,500"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, we know there are 100 surfers. When a big wave comes, only 25% of them can stay on their boards. So, we need to find out how many that is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ surfers} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 surfers who stay upright are women. So, we need to find out how many women that is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

Now, to find out how many men can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who stayed upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

1. The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 of the price of a diamond jewel. So, we need to find 4/5 of $2000.
   - 4/5 of $2000 is $1600.
3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   - So, the price of a silver jewel is $1600 - $400, which is $1200.
4. Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels:
   - Diamond jewel: $2000
   - Gold jewel: $1600
   - Silver jewel: $1200
   - Total: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Well, let's see. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflakes, so that's 16 plus 3, which makes 19 truck stamps. For the rose stamps, he got 9 less than the truck stamps, so that's 19 minus 9, which is 10 rose stamps. Now, to find out how many stamps he bought in total, we add 'em all up: 16 snowflakes, 19 trucks, and 10 roses. That's 16 plus 19 plus 10, which equals 45 stamps.

"Well, let's see. Bob is 75 miles ahead, and he's going 55 miles an hour. Tom is going 70 miles an hour. So, Tom is going 15 miles an hour faster than Bob. 

To figure out how long it takes Tom to catch up, we need to see how many hours it takes to cover that 75-mile gap at 15 miles an hour. 

If you do the math, 75 miles divided by 15 miles an hour, that's 5 hours. 

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"Okay, let's think about this. Manny's parents said they won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 each. The total cost for all the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total.

If Manny goes to all 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

But if he misses some classes, the cost per class goes up. We need to figure out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class hits $10.

Let's say Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he goes to \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve this, we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Now, subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class goes over $10.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Jewel processes 50 customers each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel processes:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ customers in a week} \]

Julie works twice as fast as Jewel. So, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers each day} \]

In a week, Julie processes:
\[ 100 \times 7 = 700 \text{ customers in a week} \]

Now, to find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week, we add their weekly totals:
\[ 350 + 700 = 1050 \text{ customers in a week} \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out.

Paisley ran 4 miles. That's easy to remember.

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. So, Reggie ran 5 times 4 miles, which is 20 miles.

Now, Reggie also ran 3 miles more than Lynn. So, if Reggie ran 20 miles, and he ran 3 miles more than Lynn, we need to figure out how many miles Lynn ran.

If we take away those 3 extra miles from Reggie's 20 miles, we get:
20 miles - 3 miles = 17 miles

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, we need to know how much one apple costs. If four apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we need to know how much one orange costs. If three oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples and 5 oranges will cost.

For 5 apples:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
So, 5 apples cost $6.50.

For 5 oranges:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]
So, 5 oranges cost $5.50.

Finally, we add the cost of the apples and the oranges together:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

"Well, let's see. Bob's diggin' a hole that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. First, we gotta figure out how much dirt he's movin'. You multiply the length by the width by the depth, so that's 6 times 4 times 3, which gives us 72 cubic feet of dirt.

Now, Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel each cubic foot. So, if he's got 72 cubic feet to move, and it takes him 3 seconds for each one, we just multiply 72 by 3. That's 216 seconds.

So, it'll take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"Well, let's see here. Bill's truck costs start with the base price, which is $30,000. Now, he's adding a bunch of extras:

- The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
- The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab, so that's $2,500.
- The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so that's $2,000.
- The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add it all up:

- Base price: $30,000
- King cab: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Light package: $1,500

So, $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Well, let's see. Tim's old salary was $20,000 a month. With a 5% raise, that's an extra $1,000 a month. So, his new salary is $21,000 a month.

Now, he gets a bonus that's half a month's new salary. Half of $21,000 is $10,500.

If he makes $21,000 a month, in a year he makes $21,000 times 12, which is $252,000. Add the bonus of $10,500 to that, and he makes $262,500 in a year.

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"Well, let's see here. James bought some fancy clothes, and we gotta figure out how much he spent.

First, he bought 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, for the suits, he spent:
10 suits ร $750/suit = $7500

Next, he bought 10 pairs of dress pants. The pants cost 1/5 of what a suit costs, so each pair of pants is:
$750 รท 5 = $150
So, for the pants, he spent:
10 pairs ร $150/pair = $1500

Then, he bought 3 dress shirts for each suit. He has 10 suits, so that's:
10 suits ร 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts
Each shirt costs $60, so for the shirts, he spent:
30 shirts ร $60/shirt = $1800

Now, we add it all up:
$7500 (suits) + $1500 (pants) + $1800 (shirts) = $10800

So, James spent a total of $10800 on all the clothes.

Now, Stanley, he was going a bit slower, at 10 miles every hour, and he rode for 2 and a half hours. So, if you multiply 10 by 2.5, you get 25 miles. That's how far Stanley went.

To find out how far they both went, you just add those two numbers together. So, 54 miles plus 25 miles equals 79 miles.

"Well, let's see. Bill can dig 4 feet of soil in one hour. He's got 24 feet of soil to dig through, so that's 24 divided by 4, which is 6 hours for the soil.

Now, for the clay, he can only dig half as fast, so that's 2 feet per hour. He's got 8 feet of clay to dig through, so that's 8 divided by 2, which is 4 hours for the clay.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates. Each one cost her $20. So, she paid:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]
But she had a voucher that gave her $2 off, so she only paid:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price went up to $30 per pomegranate. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at this new price, so she would have paid:

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Ariadne sells red and green hats. In one month, she made $400 from red hats. The green hats made twice as much as the red hats, so that's $800 from green hats.

Now, to find out how much she made in total for that month, we add the red and green hat sales:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

So, she made $1200 in the first month.

In the second month, she made \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what she made in the first month. So, we need to find \(\frac{3}{4}\) of $1200:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

So, she made $900 in the second month.

To find out how much she made in total over the two months, we add the sales from both months:

First, we need to know how many deviled egg halves 16 guests will eat:
16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves.

Now, since 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many eggs make 48 deviled egg halves:
48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens that is:

So, every month, he's spending $5,000 for the hanger and $10,000 for fuel, which adds up to $15,000 a month. Over a year, that's 12 months, so he spends $15,000 times 12, which is $180,000.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

First, we figure out how much 1/2 pound of almonds costs. Since a pound of almonds costs $10, half a pound would be:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we figure out how much 1/3 pound of walnuts costs. Since a pound of walnuts costs $15, one-third of a pound would be:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's do the same for the second mixture. We figure out how much 1/5 pound of almonds costs:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for 1/3 pound of walnuts is the same as before:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"Well, let's see. I know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. And I also know that each animal has one head. So, if there are 20 heads, that means there are 20 animals in total.

Now, if all 20 animals were geese, they would have 40 legs in total (20 geese * 2 legs each). But we know there are 70 legs in total. So, the extra legs must be from the sheep.

The difference between the total legs and the legs if all were geese is:
70 legs - 40 legs = 30 legs

Since each sheep has 2 extra legs compared to a goose, the number of sheep is:
30 legs / 2 legs per sheep = 15 sheep

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"Well, let's see. James delivers 600 newspapers in a day. He gives 198 to District A and 209 to District C. To find out how many he gives to District B, we need to take away the ones he gives to District A and District C from the total.

So, 600 minus 198 is 402. Then, 402 minus 209 is 193.

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

"Well, let's see. John's takin' a cookin' class, and he goes 4 times a week, each time for 2 hours. That's 8 hours a week. He does this for 6 weeks, so that's 8 times 6, which is 48 hours total. Now, he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. So, we take 48 and divide it by 1.5. That's 32 recipes he learns.

32"
"Well, let's see. There are 150 teachers on the court, and 60 out of every 100 of them are history teachers. So, we can figure out how many history teachers there are by doing a bit of math:

150 teachers times 60% (which is the same as 0.60) gives us:
150 * 0.60 = 90 history teachers.

Now, if there are 150 teachers in total and 90 of them are history teachers, then the rest must be math teachers. So, we subtract the history teachers from the total:
150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.

Each of these math teachers sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours all the math teachers sleep together in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours they sleep:
60 * 6 = 360 hours.

So, the math teachers sleep a total of 360 hours in one day.

360"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting out coins.

1. **Aurelia's Money:**
   - Aurelia has $120.

2. **Kassidy's Money:**
   - Kassidy has 3/4 of what Aurelia has.
   - So, Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \) dollars.

3. **Rayna's Money:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - So, Rayna has \( 90 + 60 = 150 \) dollars.

4. **Total Money:**
   - Add up all the money: \( 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \) dollars.

5. **Sharing Equally:**
   - There are 3 people, so each person gets \( \frac{360}{3} = 120 \) dollars.

So, if they share the money equally, each person would have 120 dollars.

"Well, let's see. Each part of the game, they call it a quarter, lasts 12 minutes. There are four of these parts, so that's 12 minutes times 4, which is 48 minutes. But the game was tied at the end, so they played extra, right? They added 5 more minutes. So, you add those 5 minutes to the 48 minutes, and that makes 53 minutes. The whole game lasted 53 minutes.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way:

First, we need to figure out how many of the 50 employees are management. If 20% of the employees are management, we can find that by doing:

50 employees ร 20% = 10 management employees

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. If 30% of the management employees do this, we can find that by doing:

10 management employees ร 30% = 3 employees

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

"Well, let's see. For one muffin, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and a quarter of a tablespoon of salt. That's 5 + 3 + 0.25, which is 8.25 tablespoons of dry stuff for one muffin.

Now, if she wants to make 16 muffins, we just multiply 8.25 by 16. 

8.25 times 16 is 132.

So, Svetlana needs 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

"Well, let's see. Robert got 3 pounds of candy, Cindy got 5 pounds, and Aaron got 4 pounds. If they put all their candy together, that's 3 plus 5 plus 4, which makes 12 pounds of candy. Now, if they share it equally, they gotta split the 12 pounds by 3, 'cause there are 3 of them. So, 12 divided by 3 is 4. Each of them would get 4 pounds of candy.

"Well, let's see. Adam bought 7 candies of type A, and each one costs 50 cents. So, 7 times 50 cents is $3.50. Then, he bought 10 candies of type B, and each one costs 75 cents. So, 10 times 75 cents is $7.50. Now, if we add $3.50 and $7.50, that's $11. Adam gave the cashier $15, so if we take $11 away from $15, he should get $4 back in change.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

Christina had 30 days to record her moods. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. That means the neutral days are:
30 - 12 - 8 = 10 neutral days.

Now, let's break it down by the groups of 8 days:
- The first 8 days were all good.
- The next 8 days were all bad.
- The next 8 days were all neutral.

That covers 24 days. So, we have 6 days left to account for.

The next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, the last 6 days look like this:
- Good
- Neutral
- Good
- Neutral
- Neutral
- Neutral

Now, let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good (1)
- Neutral
- Good (2)
- Neutral
- Neutral
- Neutral

So, in the last 6 days, there are 2 good days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Last 6 days: 2 good days

Total good days:
8 + 2 = 10 good days

But we know Christina had 12 good days in total. So, the remaining good days are:
12 - 10 = 2 good days

So, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Well, let's see. Janey has 21 books, and that's 3 more than twice what Sally has. So, if we take away those 3 extra books from Janey, she'd have 18 books. Now, 18 is twice what Sally has, so Sally must have half of 18. Half of 18 is 9. So, Sally has 9 books.

"Well, let's see. The bamboo grows 30 inches every day, and right now it's 20 feet tall. First, we need to figure out how many inches 20 feet is. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 20 feet is 20 times 12, which is 240 inches.

The bamboo needs to grow to 600 inches. So, we need to find out how many more inches it needs to grow. That's 600 minus 240, which is 360 inches.

Now, if the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we need to find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches. We do this by dividing 360 by 30, which gives us 12 days.

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Okay, let's break this down simple-like.

James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs show up, so he needs 8 more toys. That makes 12 toys for 12 dogs.

After he buys the toys, he goes back and finds out there are now twice as many dogs as when he left. So, if there were 12 dogs, now there are 24 dogs. He needs 12 more toys to have enough for all 24 dogs.

Then, when he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone. So now, he only needs toys for 21 dogs. He already has 12 toys, so he needs 9 more toys to have enough for 21 dogs.

So, let's add it all up:
- 4 toys he started with
- 8 toys he bought first
- 12 toys he bought second
- 9 toys he bought last

4 + 8 + 12 + 9 = 33 toys

But since 3 dogs are gone, he doesn't need 3 toys anymore. So, 33 - 3 = 30 toys.

James needs 30 toys in total.

So, Dylan put in $480. Now, we need to see how much is left:
\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Frances then put in 2/3 of what was left. So, we figure out what 2/3 of 720 is:
\[ 720 \times \frac{2}{3} = 480 \]

So, Frances put in $480. Now, we need to see how much is left for Skyler:
\[ 720 - 480 = 240 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting cookies in a jar.

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, the Cookie Monster must have 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, Summer must have 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Well, let's see. Shania made her dress longer by half its original length and then added 20 more centimeters of lace at the bottom. The dress ended up being 140 centimeters long. 

So, if we take away the 20 centimeters of lace, the dress before adding the lace was 120 centimeters long. This 120 centimeters is the original length plus half of the original length. 

If we call the original length \( L \), then \( L + 0.5L = 120 \). This means \( 1.5L = 120 \). To find \( L \), we divide 120 by 1.5:

\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original dress was 80 centimeters long.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets. Their combined ages add up to 44.

Let's call the age of one of the triplets ""R"" and the age of one of the twins ""T.""

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet:
   \( T = R + 7 \)

2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
   \( 2T + 3R = 44 \)

Now, let's substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify that:
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:
\[ 5R = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, we know one of the triplets is 6 years old. To find the age of one of the twins:
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the cost of the 5 lollipops is:

5 lollipops ร $0.40 = $2.00

That means the 4 candies must have cost:

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

So, each candy costs:

$1.20 รท 4 candies = $0.30

Now, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. 

10 lollipops ร $0.40 = $4.00
10 candies ร $0.30 = $3.00

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. So, in one year, he saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 240 \text{ coins/year} \]

Over ten years, Rong saves:
\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Now, Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) \]
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins} \]
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In one year, Neil saves:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 336 \text{ coins/year} \]

Over ten years, Neil saves:
\[ 336 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, let's add Rong's and Neil's total savings:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, after ten years, they have:

"Well, let's see. John's dog needs two shots, and each shot costs $20. So, that's $40 for the shots. Now, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If we add the shots and the heartworm check, it makes up the whole bill.

Let's call the total bill ""T."" The heartworm check is 60% of T, so the shots are the rest, which is 40% of T. We know the shots cost $40, so 40% of T is $40. To find T, we can say:

40% of T = $40
0.40 * T = $40
T = $40 / 0.40
T = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125, so he leaves with:

$125 - $100 = $25

"Well, let's see. I ain't no expert, but I can do some simple math.

- One apple costs 50 cents. There are 12 apples, so that's 12 times 50 cents, which is 6 dollars.

- An orange costs three times as much as a banana, so that's 3 dollars each. There are 7 oranges, so that's 21 dollars.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Apples: 6 dollars
- Bananas: 5 dollars
- Oranges: 21 dollars

So, the total cost of the crate is 6 + 5 + 21, which is 32 dollars.

- The green squares, there are 6 more than the blue ones, so that's 18 + 6, which makes 24 green squares.
- The white squares, there are 12 fewer than the green ones, so that's 24 - 12, which makes 12 white squares.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Red: 14
- Blue: 18
- Green: 24

For the grown-ups, we need 42 chairs. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, if there are 8 high chairs, then there are 5 times 8, which is 40 regular chairs. 

We need 42 regular chairs, and we only got 40, so we're short by 2 regular chairs.

Adding up the chairs we're short, we need 7 high chairs and 2 regular chairs, which makes 9 more chairs in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has 50 points. That's easy to remember.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty has 30% more points than Adam. So, we need to find out what 30% of 50 is and add it to 50.
   - 30% of 50 is 15 (because 30% is the same as 0.30, and 0.30 times 50 is 15).
   - So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Betty has 65 points, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta has 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Tom has 35 points, so Marta has 3 times 35, which is 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Marta: 105 points

Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. So, we need to find out how many more points they need:

Hannah's also gonna set off some fireworks in her backyard. She's got 3 boxes, and each box has 5 fireworks. So, that's 3 times 5, which is 15 fireworks.

- Total drinks: 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks
- Total snacks: 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks

Drinks and snacks each cost $2. So, the total cost is:
- Cost of drinks: 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
- Cost of snacks: 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Adding these together, the total amount spent is:
$80 + $120 = $200

First, we add up what Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry:
4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we know the total is 11,600 pounds, so we subtract what Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total:

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

Next, there are 8 males, including Larry. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
So, the total number of dumplings the males ate is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Now, to find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males:

$4200 รท $700 = 6 hours

So, they need 6 more hours. But they've already been fundraising for 3 hours, so in total, they need:

3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours

The total number of hours they have to fundraise to reach their goal is:

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

The city of Colorado uses 40% of the water from the river. Now, 80% of that 40% is used for industrial stuff. We need to find out how much of the river's water is used for other things, like homes and farms.

First, let's figure out how much water is used for industrial stuff:
40% of the river's water is used by the city, and 80% of that is for industry. So, 40% times 80% is:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

This means 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes.

Now, to find out how much is used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial water from the total water used by the city:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the river's water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"Well, let's see. If Alex charges $12 for each day and there are 7 days in a week, then for one week, she charges $12 times 7, which is $84. For two weeks, you just double that, so it's $84 times 2. That comes out to $168. So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. So, in one hour, it makes 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

The factory also makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. So, in one hour, it makes 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

Now, if we want to know how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours, we just need to multiply the hourly rates by 48.

For chocolate ice cream:
50 quarts per hour ร 48 hours = 2400 quarts

For vanilla ice cream:
12.5 quarts per hour ร 48 hours = 600 quarts

So, in 48 hours, the factory would make a total of:
2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts

"Well, let's see. Marcus bought a bunch of yummy stuff:

- 5 croissants at $3 each, so that's 5 times 3, which is $15.
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, so that's 4 times 2.50, which is $10.
- 3 mini quiches at $4 each, so that's 3 times 4, which is $12.
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1 each, so that's 13 times 1, which is $13.

Now, let's add all that up:
$15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

But wait, Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off. So, we need to take 10% off of $50. Ten percent of $50 is $5.

So, we take $5 off of $50, which leaves us with $45.

"Well, let's see. The ice cream place is sayin' if you buy 2 scoops, you get 1 free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin's got $6.00.

First, let's figure out how many scoops she can buy with her money:
$6.00 divided by $1.50 per scoop is 4 scoops.

But with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 more for free. So, if she buys 4 scoops, she gets 2 more free.

So, 4 scoops plus 2 free scoops equals 6 scoops.

Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows how to count and do some simple math.

Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to figure out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's figure out how many days are in two weeks:
- 2 weeks ร 7 days/week = 14 days

Now, let's see how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
- 4 pieces/day ร 14 days = 56 pieces

So, Ginger has:
- 100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Next, let's see how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
- 3 pieces/day ร 14 days = 42 pieces

So, Amy has:
- 100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left

Now, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- 58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

"Well, let's see. Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 36 square feet, and he wants to cover two-thirds of it. So, we need to figure out what two-thirds of 36 is. 

Two-thirds of 36 is 24 square feet. Now, for every square foot, he needs 24 tiles. So, for 24 square feet, he would need:

24 tiles/square foot ร 24 square feet = 576 tiles

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 tiles to cover two-thirds of his bathroom.

"Well, let's see. James went to pick blueberries, and it cost him $20 just to go. Then, he picked 30 pounds of blueberries, and it costs $1.5 for each pound. So, for the blueberries, he paid 30 times $1.5, which is $45. Adding the $20 to go, that's $65 in total.

Now, if he bought the same 30 pounds from the store, it would cost $2.5 for each pound. So, 30 times $2.5 is $75.

So, if he paid $65 to pick them and it would have cost $75 to buy them, he saved $10.

"Well, let's see. They wanted to buy 500 computers, and they thought each one would cost $700. But then the price went up by 10%. 

First, we need to figure out what 10% of $700 is. That's like taking $700 and dividing it by 10, which gives us $70. So, the price of each computer went up by $70.

Now, the new price of each computer is $700 plus $70, which is $770.

To find out how much they paid for all 500 computers, we multiply $770 by 500. 

So, $770 times 500 is $385,000.

The total amount of money they paid is:
385,000"
"Well, let's see. John's makin' himself a big omelet with 6 eggs, 2 ounces of cheese, and 2 ounces of ham. 

First, we gotta figure out the calories for each part:
- Each egg has 75 calories, so 6 eggs would be 6 times 75, which is 450 calories.
- The cheese is 120 calories per ounce, so 2 ounces would be 2 times 120, which is 240 calories.
- The ham is 40 calories per ounce, so 2 ounces would be 2 times 40, which is 80 calories.

Now, we add 'em all up:
- 450 calories from the eggs
- 240 calories from the cheese
- 80 calories from the ham

So, the total is 450 plus 240 plus 80, which equals 770 calories.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Helga can tap her right foot 300 times a minute and her left foot 250 times a minute when her arms are at her sides. When she raises her arms, she can only tap each foot 200 times a minute.

She dances for 5 minutes total, but only 2 of those minutes with her arms raised. So, for 3 minutes, her arms are at her sides.

First, let's figure out how many taps she does with her right foot:
- With her arms at her sides (3 minutes): 300 taps/minute ร 3 minutes = 900 taps
- With her arms raised (2 minutes): 200 taps/minute ร 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Total right foot taps: 900 + 400 = 1300 taps

Now, let's figure out how many taps she does with her left foot:
- With her arms at her sides (3 minutes): 250 taps/minute ร 3 minutes = 750 taps
- With her arms raised (2 minutes): 200 taps/minute ร 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Total left foot taps: 750 + 400 = 1150 taps

Finally, let's add the total taps from both feet:
- Total taps: 1300 (right foot) + 1150 (left foot) = 2450 taps

So, the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is:

So, the cost of the asphalt is:
3 buckets ร $25 = $75

Add that to the fine:
$120 + $75 = $195

Now, if he fixes it himself, he saves:
$450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. **Total Pizzas and Slices:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each got a pizza.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - So, 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices total.

2. **Slices Eaten by Bryce and Two Friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - 2/3 of 12 slices is 8 slices per pizza.
   - So, 3 people * 8 slices each = 24 slices eaten.

3. **Slices Eaten by the Other Two Friends:**
   - The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - 3/4 of 12 slices is 9 slices per pizza.
   - So, 2 people * 9 slices each = 18 slices eaten.

4. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten by everyone = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (other two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices Left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

So, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

Now, to find the average time, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2. So, 30 minutes plus 20 minutes is 50 minutes. Then, 50 minutes divided by 2 is 25 minutes.

So, the average time they take to eat the sausages is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how long Topher's shoe is in inches. The problem says it's 8 feet and 4 inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 8 feet is 8 times 12, which is 96 inches. Add the 4 inches, and we get:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Now, the problem says that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe \( x \) inches. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Well, let's see. Hannah went a bit crazy and started breaking windows. She broke a quarter of the students' car windows and three-quarters of the teachers' car windows.

First, let's figure out the students' car windows:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- So, 64 cars times 4 windows each equals 256 windows.
- Hannah broke a quarter of these, so 256 divided by 4 equals 64 windows.

Now, for the teachers' car windows:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- So, 32 cars times 2 windows each equals 64 windows.
- Hannah broke three-quarters of these, so 64 times 3/4 equals 48 windows.

Adding them up:
- 64 windows from the students' cars plus 48 windows from the teachers' cars equals 112 windows.

So, Hannah smashed 112 windows.

"Well, let's see. Candy has 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools. That's 60 blue spools in total. She also has 40 light green spools and 50 dark green spools, which adds up to 90 green spools. So, all together, she has 60 blue spools and 90 green spools, making 150 spools in total.

To find out what percent of her spools are blue, we need to figure out what part 60 is of 150. We can do this by dividing 60 by 150 and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

So, 60 divided by 150 is 0.4. Then, 0.4 times 100 is 40.

So, 40% of her spools are blue.

- 6 adults want 1 smore each. So, 6 adults times 1 smore is 6 smores.

Now, add those up:
- 18 smores for the kids plus 6 smores for the adults equals 24 smores total.

Next, we need to know how many sleeves of graham crackers we need:
- Each sleeve makes 8 smores. So, we need to see how many 8s go into 24.
- 24 divided by 8 is 3. So, we need 3 sleeves of graham crackers.

- Twice Dora's age is 15 times 2, which is 30.
- Eight more than 30 is 38.
So, Dora's dad is 38 years old.

Now, Dora's mom is four years younger than her dad. So, we subtract 4 from 38:
- 38 minus 4 is 34.
So, Dora's mom is 34 years old.

To find the total combined age of Dora, her dad, and her mom, we add their ages together:
- Dora's age is 15.
- Her dad's age is 38.
- Her mom's age is 34.
- 15 plus 38 plus 34 is 87.

So, the total combined age is 87."

3. Now, we know Candidate A got 20 votes and Candidate B got 30 votes. That's a total of 50 votes.
4. Since there were 100 votes in total, the rest of the votes must have gone to Candidate C. So, 100 votes minus the 50 votes for A and B leaves 50 votes for Candidate C.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving away 10 apples, Boris has:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]
apples.

Beck, after receiving 10 apples, has:
\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

- For the giant cubes, each one uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 of these, so:
  3 giant cubes ร 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces

- For the medium cubes, each one uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 of these, so:
  7 medium cubes ร 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces

- For the small cubes, each one uses 1/2 an ounce of water. Peter makes 8 of these, so:
  8 small cubes ร 1/2 ounce per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up all the water used:
12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

- For the little ones: 2 times $12 is $24.

So, the total for the first park is $52 plus $24, which is $76.

Now, for the second amusement park, it costs $14 for each grown-up and $10 for each little one. So that's:

- For the grown-ups: 2 times $14 is $28.
- For the little ones: 2 times $10 is $20.

So, the total for the second park is $28 plus $20, which is $48.

Now, if he saves 50 dollars a day, and there are 7 days in a week, he saves 50 dollars times 7 days, which is 350 dollars a week.

"Well, let's see. Sean has 56 marbles. Carl has four times as many as Sean, so that's 4 times 56, which is 224 marbles. Sean has half as many as Cal, so Cal has 2 times 56, which is 112 marbles. 

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have together, we add 224 and 112. That's 336 marbles.

336"
"Well, let's see. We got 54 kids, and we need to split them into 6 groups. That means each group has 9 kids, right? Now, if we need 12 groups instead, we still got the same number of kids, but we gotta make more groups. So, we already have 6 groups, and we need 12. That means we need 6 more groups.

"Well, let's see. Candy has a chair rental business, and she rents out different numbers of chairs on weekdays and weekends. 

- On weekdays, she rents out 60 chairs each day.
- On weekends, she rents out 100 chairs each day.

Now, in two 4-week months, we have:
- 40 weekdays (20 weekdays per month times 2 months).
- 16 weekend days (8 weekend days per month times 2 months).

So, for the weekdays:
- 60 chairs times 40 weekdays equals 2400 chairs.

For the weekends:
- 100 chairs times 16 weekend days equals 1600 chairs.

Adding these together:
- 2400 chairs plus 1600 chairs equals 4000 chairs.

So, Candy will rent out 4000 chairs in total in two 4-week months.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

1. Gunther had 48 bananas to start with.
2. Arnold took half of them. Half of 48 is 24, so Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas. So, 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
4. Later that evening, Arnold took 12 more bananas. So, 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas. So, 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

43"
"Well, let's see. There are 5 people in the house, including Jenna. The electricity bill is $100 every month. So, we need to figure out how much each person pays in a year.

First, we find out how much the bill is for the whole year:
$100 every month times 12 months in a year, that's $1200 for the year.

Now, we split that $1200 by the 5 people:
$1200 divided by 5 is $240.

So, each person, including Jenna, pays $240 a year for electricity.

"Well, let's see. Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates to a party. That's 8 times 12 glasses, which is 96 glasses, and 4 times 12 plates, which is 48 plates. When they came back, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, we take away the broken ones:

For the glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses left.
For the plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates left.

Now, if we add the glasses and plates that are left, we get:
86 + 42 = 128

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. That means she trades:
\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]
Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. That means she trades:
\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]
Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 20 large stickers left. She trades these for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, by the end, she has:
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers
- 20 large buttons

To find the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. Each large button is worth three small buttons, so:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Adding all the small buttons together:
\[ 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:
\[ 147 \]

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, there are 33 people on the council, and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against. That means if we split the votes into three parts, two parts are in favor and one part is against.

If we divide 33 by 3, we get 11. So, 11 people voted against the new regulation. Since twice as many people voted in favor, that means 2 times 11, which is 22 people voted in favor.

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

22"
"Well, let's see here. Krissa needs to order shirts for her little ones. Here's how it breaks down:

- 11 kids need extra-small shirts.
- For the small shirts, it's twice as many as the extra-small, so that's 22 kids.
- For the medium shirts, it's 4 less than the small, so that's 18 kids.
- For the large shirts, it's half as many as the medium, so that's 9 kids.
- For the extra-large shirts, it's 6 more than the large, so that's 15 kids.

Now, let's add 'em all up:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out. If the bag is marked at $140 and there's a 5% discount, we need to find out how much 5% of $140 is and then take that off the price.

First, 5% of $140 is:
\[ 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

So, the discount is $7. Now, we subtract that from the original price:
\[ 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, you'll pay $133 after the discount.

"Okay, let's break this down simple-like.

First, we got 50 people. Now, 20 out of every 100 people think horse #2 will win. So, 20% of 50 is 10 people. That means 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we have 50 people minus the 10 people who think horse #2 will win, which leaves us with 40 people.

Next, 60 out of every 100 of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, 60% of 40 is 24 people. That means 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we have 40 people minus the 24 people who think horse #7 will win, which leaves us with 16 people.

So, the rest of the people, which is 16, think horse #12 will win.

"Okay, let's figure this out. We got three houses that need shingles. The first house needs half as many shingles as the second house. The third house needs twice as many shingles as the first house. All together, they need 250 cases of shingles.

Let's call the number of cases the first house needs ""x."" So:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (because it's twice the first).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (because it's twice the first).

Now, we add them all up:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

That's:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. The third house needs twice that, which is:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

The third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Well, let's see. Leila got 3 cucumbers, and they cost $2 each. So, that's 3 times 2, which is $6. Jack bought 5 tomatoes, and they're $1 each, so that's 5 times 1, which is $5. Chase got 1 head of lettuce for $3. So, if we add all that up, it's $6 for the cucumbers, $5 for the tomatoes, and $3 for the lettuce. That makes $6 + $5 + $3, which is $14.

"Well, let's see. Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches. On Monday, she taught for 5 hours, so that's 5 times 15, which is 75 dollars. She also taught more than 3 classes, so she gets an extra 5 dollars. That makes it 80 dollars for Monday.

On Wednesday, she taught for 2 hours, so that's 2 times 15, which is 30 dollars. She didn't teach more than 3 classes, so no extra money that day.

Now, if we add up what she made on both days, it's 80 dollars plus 30 dollars, which is 110 dollars.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way.

The perfume company has 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents. They sold 5 of each vanilla scent and 2 of each fruity scent.

First, let's figure out how many vanilla scents they sold:
- They have 4 vanilla scents.
- They sold 5 of each.
- So, 4 scents ร 5 sales each = 20 vanilla scents sold.

Next, let's figure out how many fruity scents they sold:
- They have 8 fruity scents.
- They sold 2 of each.
- So, 8 scents ร 2 sales each = 16 fruity scents sold.

Now, to find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents:
- Vanilla scents sold: 20
- Fruity scents sold: 16
- Difference: 20 - 16 = 4

So, 4 more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents.

"Well, let's see. Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. That's 20 times 3, which is 60 dollars. He wants to make a total of 135 dollars. So, he still needs 135 minus 60, which is 75 dollars from the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he needs to sell each ear for, we take the 75 dollars he needs and divide it by the 25 ears of corn. That's 75 divided by 25, which is 3 dollars.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for 3 dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. That's a total of 12 hours over the weekend.

She reads for 3 hours. So, 12 hours minus 3 hours for reading leaves her with 9 hours.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. So, 1/3 of 9 hours is 3 hours for video games.

Now, she has 9 hours left after reading, and she spends 3 of those hours on video games. That leaves her with 6 hours for playing soccer.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we take the 6 hours she spends on soccer and divide it by the total 12 hours she has over the weekend, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

50%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave half of them to Brandon. Half of 50 is 25, so he gave 25 pencils to Brandon. Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils that is, we need to figure out what 3/5 of 25 is. 

3/5 of 25 is the same as 3 times (25 divided by 5). So, 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 3 times 5 is 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

- 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.

Next, let's figure out how many wheels the motorcycles need:
- 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, let's add those up to see how many wheels he needs in total:
- 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. So, to find out how many wheels are left after he uses what he needs, we do:
- 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

So, Henry will have 276 wheels left.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Mike has 600 movies. He wants to replace them with digital versions. Here's how it works:

1. **Movies in Series:**
   - A third of his movies are in series. That's 200 movies.
   - He can get these series for a sixth of the cost of a normal movie.
   - A normal movie costs $10, so a series movie costs $10 / 6 = $1.67.
   - So, for 200 series movies, it costs 200 * $1.67 = $333.33.

2. **Remaining Movies:**
   - After the series movies, he has 600 - 200 = 400 movies left.
   - 40% of these are older movies. That's 40% of 400, which is 0.4 * 400 = 160 older movies.
   - Older movies cost $5 each.
   - So, for 160 older movies, it costs 160 * $5 = $800.

3. **Newer Movies:**
   - The rest of the movies are newer. That's 400 - 160 = 240 newer movies.
   - Newer movies cost $10 each.
   - So, for 240 newer movies, it costs 240 * $10 = $2400.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Add up all the costs: $333.33 (series) + $800 (older) + $2400 (newer) = $3533.33.

So, the total cost to replace all the movies is $3533.33.

"Well, lemme see now. If peaches cost 2 dollars a pound and I picked 6 pounds, that's 12 dollars for the peaches. Then, plums are 1 dollar a pound, and 8 pounds of those would be 8 dollars. Apricots are 3 dollars a pound, so 6 pounds of those would be 18 dollars. Now, if I add all that up: 12 dollars for the peaches, 8 dollars for the plums, and 18 dollars for the apricots, that's 38 dollars all together.

"Well, let's see. The Llesis family drove and hiked to their vacation spot. They drove for 4.5 hours at 50 miles per hour, and hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed that's 5 miles per hour less than half of 50 miles per hour.

First, let's figure out how far they drove:
- They drove for 4.5 hours at 50 miles per hour, so that's 4.5 times 50, which is 225 miles.

Next, let's figure out how fast they hiked:
- Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour.
- They hiked 5 miles per hour less than that, so they hiked at 20 miles per hour.
- They hiked for 1.5 hours, so that's 1.5 times 20, which is 30 miles.

Now, let's add the distances together:
- They drove 225 miles and hiked 30 miles, so the total distance is 225 plus 30, which is 255 miles.

So, the vacation spot was 255 miles away.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out step by step.

Ava and Emma are playing a video game. They get points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and finishing the level with time left on the clock. Here's how it works:

- For every enemy they jump on, they get 10 points.
- For every berry they collect, they get 5 points.
- For every second left on the clock when they finish, they get 30 points.

Now, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, collects 3 more berries, but finishes 4 seconds slower. We need to find out how many more points Ava has compared to Emma.

Let's break it down:

1. **Enemies:**
   - If Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Emma's points from enemies: \( 10E \)
   - Ava's points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)

2. **Berries:**
   - If Emma collects \( B \) berries, Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Emma's points from berries: \( 5B \)
   - Ava's points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)

3. **Time:**
   - If Emma finishes with \( T \) seconds left, Ava finishes with \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Emma's points from time: \( 30T \)
   - Ava's points from time: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

Now, let's add up the points for both:

- **Emma's total score:**
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T
  \]

- **Ava's total score:**
  \[
  10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
  \]
  Simplify Ava's total score:
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
  \]

Finally, to find the difference in their scores:
\[
(10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) = 25

So, the difference between their scores is:

"Well, let's see. Four pizzas cost 64 dollars total. Two of them cost 30 dollars together. So, the other two pizzas must cost 64 minus 30, which is 34 dollars. Since these two pizzas cost the same, you just split 34 in half. That's 17 dollars each.

"Well, let's see. Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's 3 times 5, which is 15 rides. Then, on 2 other days, they ride twice as much, so that's 6 times a day for 2 days. That's 6 times 2, which is 12 rides. So, in a week, they ride their bikes 15 plus 12 times. That makes 27 times in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Bob started with 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white. He went to the pet store and got 17 more fish. After adding these new fish, he found out he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say he got \( x \) white fish and \( y \) orange fish from the store. We know:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (because he got 17 fish in total)
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
3. The number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \).

Now, let's solve these step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To check:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"Alright, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

First, Andy drives to work and back home every day. The one-way trip is 5 miles, so the round trip is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

He does this from Monday to Friday, so the total distance for the week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Now, Andy's car gets 10 miles per gallon. So, to find out how many gallons he uses in a week, we divide the total miles by the miles per gallon:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost for the gas used in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Andy's car is consuming:
\[ 15 \]

"Well, let's see. My aunt gave me some money for lunch. She gave me ten twenties and a bunch of quarters, 140 of 'em.

First, let's figure out how much the quarters are worth. Each quarter is 25 cents, so 140 quarters would be:
140 times 25 cents, which is 35 dollars.

Next, I got ten twenties, and I spent 3 out of every 5 of those twenties. So, I spent:
3 out of 5 of 200 dollars, which is 120 dollars.

Now, to find out how much I spent in total, I add the money from the quarters and the money from the twenties:
35 dollars plus 120 dollars, which is 155 dollars.

So, the total amount I paid for lunch is:

$150 (left to pay) - $50 (John's part) = $100

So, John is still missing $100.

"Well, let's see. If it's 45 degrees during the day and it gets 33 degrees colder at night, that means it's gonna be 12 degrees at night. Now, to keep the pipes from freezing, we need to get the temperature up to 32 degrees. So, we need to raise the temperature by 20 degrees. If each log of wood warms the house by 5 degrees, then we need to burn 4 logs to get that extra 20 degrees.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out on my own.

First, we got 90 people, and they need to split into groups of 9. So, we divide 90 by 9:
\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]
So, there are 10 groups.

Now, the problem says that 3 out of every 5 groups had members bring back seashells. So, we need to find out how many groups that is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]
So, 6 groups had members bring back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups had 9 people, and each person brought back 2 seashells. So, we need to find out how many seashells that is:
\[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:
108"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting folks on a train.

1. The train starts with 172 people.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on. So, we take away 47 and add 13:
   - 172 - 47 = 125
   - 125 + 13 = 138
3. At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, we take away 38:
   - 138 - 38 = 100

So, after all that, there are 100 people left on the train.

"Well, let's see. Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day, and each one is worth a quarter, which is 25 cents. So, in one day, he gets 10 times 25 cents, which is 250 cents. Since 100 cents make a dollar, 250 cents is the same as 2 dollars and 50 cents. 

Now, if he does this for 30 days, we need to figure out how much he gets in total. So, 2 dollars and 50 cents times 30 days. That's like saying 2.50 dollars times 30. 

If you do the math, 2.50 times 30 is 75 dollars.

75"
"Well, let's see. Jamie makes $20 for each hour she works, and she works 8 hours a day. So, for the first 8 hours, she makes:

8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Now, she worked 3 extra hours. For these extra hours, she gets paid 150% of her normal rate. So, her overtime rate is:

150% of $20 = 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour

For the 3 extra hours, she makes:

3 hours * $30/hour = $90

So, in total, for working 11 hours, she makes:

$160 + $90 = $250

250"
"Well, let's see. The zookeeper counted 12 female lions, and half as many male lions, so that's 6 male lions. Then there are 14 little lion cubs. If we add 'em all up, that's 12 plus 6 plus 14, which gives us 32 lions in total.

32"
"Well, let's see. The jeans Mike wants are 25% off, and they usually cost $40. 

First, we figure out what 25% of $40 is. That's like taking a quarter of $40, which is $10. So, the discount is $10.

Now, we take the original price and subtract the discount: $40 minus $10, which gives us $30. That's how much Mike has to pay for the jeans.

If Mike pays with a $50 bill, we need to figure out how much change he gets back. We take the $50 and subtract the $30 he paid for the jeans. 

$50 minus $30 is $20.

So, Mike will have $20 left over.

20"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

The company starts with 200 employees. Every month, they hire 20 more. So, after three months, they will have:

- First month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
- Second month: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
- Third month: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

So, after three months, the company has 260 employees.

Each employee gets paid $4000 a month. So, the total amount paid to all employees each month is:

260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000

Since we need to know the total amount paid over three months, we multiply this by 3:

$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

So, the company pays a total of $3,120,000 to its employees after three months.

3,120,000"
"Well, let's see. If they're gonna sing ""Deck the Halls"" two times and it's 150 seconds long, that's 150 seconds times 2, which is 300 seconds. Then, they're singing ""Jingle Bells"" once, and that's 240 seconds. So, we add 300 seconds and 240 seconds together, and that gives us 540 seconds. 

So, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds.

540"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Billy started at $10 an hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of 50 cents, so he was making $10.50 an hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1, so now he makes $11.50 an hour.

Sally just started, and she makes 50 cents more than what Billy started with. So, Sally makes $10.50 an hour.

Now, if both work 20 hours, we need to figure out how much each makes and then see the difference.

Billy makes $11.50 an hour, so for 20 hours, he makes:
\[ 11.50 \times 20 = 230 \text{ dollars} \]

Sally makes $10.50 an hour, so for 20 hours, she makes:
\[ 10.50 \times 20 = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more Billy makes than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's:
\[ 230 - 210 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"Well, let's see. If a loaf of bread costs $2, then 3 loaves would be 3 times $2, which is $6. Now, if a bagel costs $1, then 2 bagels would be 2 times $1, which is $2. So, the 3 loaves of bread cost $6 and the 2 bagels cost $2. The difference is $6 minus $2, which is $4.

"Well, let's see. Pierson scored 278 points. Now, Nikita got 11 more than half of what Pierson got. Half of 278 is 139, and if you add 11 to that, Nikita got 150 points. So, if we add Pierson's 278 points and Nikita's 150 points together, they scored 428 points in total.

428"
"Well, let's see. If each class has 25 kids and there are 40 classes, that means there are 1000 kids in total. Each kid plants one tree, so that's 1000 trees from the kids.

Now, for the teachers, if there are 3 teachers in each of the 40 classes, that means there are 120 teachers. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so that's 240 trees from the teachers.

Add the trees from the kids and the teachers together, and you get 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted is 1240."
"Well, let's see. Bubbles has a bunch of stuffed animals, right? She's got 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. That's 14 stuffed animals in total.

Now, she wants to buy some stuffed goats so that the goats make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. To figure this out, we need to think about what 30% means. It's like saying 30 out of every 100 things.

If we let \( x \) be the number of goats she needs to buy, then the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the goats to be 30% of this total, so:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this step by step. First, we multiply 0.30 by 14:

\[ 0.30 \times 14 = 4.2 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we need to get \( x \) by itself. We do this by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 0.70 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. That's 14 days. So, 14 days times half an hour each day is:
14 * 0.5 = 7 hours

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. That's 7 days. So, 7 days times 2 hours each day is:
7 * 2 = 14 hours

Now, let's add the hours from both periods:
7 + 14 = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to get the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
30 - 21 = 9 hours

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"Well, let's see. If the first car is going 60 miles an hour and the second car is going 70 miles an hour, the second car is going 10 miles an hour faster. After 2 hours, the second car will have gone 140 miles (70 times 2), and the first car will have gone 120 miles (60 times 2). So, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"Well, let's see. James bought a ring for his bride-to-be. The diamond cost him $600, and the gold cost $300. So, the total cost of the materials is $600 + $300, which is $900.

Now, he had to pay a 30% extra for it to be made. To find out how much extra that is, we take 30% of $900. That's 0.30 times $900, which is $270.

So, the total amount he paid is the cost of the materials plus the extra, which is $900 + $270. That comes out to $1170.

1170"
"Well, let's see. We got 340 third-graders out of 500 who passed, 40 fourth-graders out of 100, and the fifth-graders had twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders. So, if 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, that means 80 out of 100 fifth-graders passed, right? But there are 400 fifth-graders, so 80 out of 100 is the same as 320 out of 400.

Now, let's add up all the kids who passed:
- Third-graders: 340
- Fourth-graders: 40
- Fifth-graders: 320

That's 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 kids who passed.

Now, let's add up all the kids who took the test:
- Third-graders: 500
- Fourth-graders: 100
- Fifth-graders: 400

That's 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 kids in total.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the number of kids who passed by the total number of kids:
700 / 1000 = 0.70, which is 70%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

70%"
"Well, let's see. Milo's got two bags of glass chips, and each bag has 72 chips. So, he's got:

\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Now, it takes 12 chips to make one square inch of the mosaic. So, with 144 chips, he can make:

\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how long it can be, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"Well, let's see. We got 10 quarts of tea left over. Four kids drank 1.5 quarts each, so that's 6 quarts. Sixteen other kids drank 2 quarts each, so that's 32 quarts. Add those up, 6 quarts and 32 quarts, and you get 38 quarts. Add the 10 quarts left over, and you get 48 quarts in total. Now, there's 4 quarts in a gallon, so 48 quarts is 12 gallons.

"Well, let's see. If there are 10 students at the start, and the number of students doubles every month, we can figure out how many there are by the end of May by just keepin' track of the numbers.

- Start: 10 students

- End of February: 20 times 2 is 40 students
- End of March: 40 times 2 is 80 students
- End of April: 80 times 2 is 160 students
- End of May: 160 times 2 is 320 students

So, by the end of May, there are 320 students. But we started with 10, so the number of new students that joined is 320 minus 10, which is 310.

"Well, let's see. Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges a quarter for each branch he climbs. So, to figure out how many branches he climbed, we take the $105 and divide it by the cost per branch, which is a quarter. 

$105 divided by $0.25 is 420 branches. That's how many branches he climbed in the whole week.

Now, to find out how many branches he climbed each day, we take the total branches and divide it by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

420 branches divided by 7 days is 60 branches per day.

"Well, let's see. Rose picked some flowers and then dropped a few. We need to figure out how many petals are left in the vase.

First, she picked:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 petals.
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each, so that's 4 times 6, which is 24 petals.
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 petals.
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each, so that's 6 times 7, which is 42 petals.

Now, let's add all those petals together:
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But she dropped one of each type of flower, so we need to subtract:
- 1 flower with 5 petals, so that's 5 petals.
- 1 flower with 6 petals, so that's 6 petals.
- 1 flower with 4 petals, so that's 4 petals.
- 1 flower with 7 petals, so that's 7 petals.

Now, let's add those petals she dropped:
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.

So, we subtract the petals she dropped from the total petals she picked:
101 - 22 = 79 petals.

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 79."

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

Jack and his 3 friends are playing at the arcade. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. His two friends who aren't as good can only play for 10 minutes with a quarter. His other friend, who's really good, can play for 30 minutes with a quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

First, let's see how many quarters each person uses:
- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Two friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
- Good friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, let's add up all the quarters:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: 24 quarters each, so 24 * 2 = 48 quarters
- Good friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is 25 cents, we need to find out how much 68 quarters cost:
68 quarters * 25 cents = 1700 cents

1700 cents is the same as 17 dollars.

So, the total amount of money used is:

"Well, let's see. Tanya makes a salt scrub and she uses different things to make it. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as she does fragrance. She also uses the same amount of salt as she does sugar. She uses twice as much oil as she does salt, and twice as much salt as she does zest.

If we think about it, if she uses 1 ounce of zest, she uses 1 ounce of fragrance, 2 ounces of salt, 2 ounces of sugar, and 4 ounces of oil. All of that adds up to 10 ounces, which is just right for her jar.

So, she uses 4 ounces of oil.

So, for the cows, he spent 2 times 1500, which is $3000. Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together. That's $1500 plus $3000, which equals $4500.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way.

John does 30 cycles of work each day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20.

First, let's figure out how much he makes in one day:
- He does 30 cycles a day.
- Each cycle has 5 tasks.
- So, he does 30 cycles * 5 tasks = 150 tasks a day.
- Each task pays $1.20.
- So, he makes 150 tasks * $1.20 = $180 a day.

Now, let's figure out how much he makes in a week:
- He works 7 days a week.
- So, he makes $180 a day * 7 days = $1260 a week.

So, John makes:
\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simple-like.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than what Julie scored in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 4 points in the second game.

Now, to find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we add the points from both games:
14 points (first game) + 4 points (second game) = 18 points

So, Sasha scored 18 points in total.

"Well, lemme think this through. Kimberly got 8 packages of cat food, and each package has 11 tins. So, for the cat food, that's 8 times 11, which is 88 tins.

For the dog food, she got 6 packages, and each package has 6 tins. So, for the dog food, that's 6 times 6, which is 36 tins.

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food she got, we take the cat food tins and subtract the dog food tins. So, 88 minus 36 is 52.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

First, we know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ.

Let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. Then:
- Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards (because he has 3 times as many as PJ).
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards (because she has 12 more than Smendrick).

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards the others have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Milly bought a book that cost $32. She's gonna return it, but Amazon only gives back 75% of what she paid. So, she gets back:
\[ 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to send the book back, she has to pay for shipping. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 for each pound. So, the cost for the weight is:
\[ 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

The book also needs to travel 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 for each mile. So, the cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total shipping cost is:
\[ 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

"Well, let's see. Boris makes a whole lotta chocolate, 50,000 bars a month. He starts off with 8,000 bars the first week. The next week, he only makes half of that, so that's 4,000 bars. Then, in the third week, he goes all out and makes three times what he did the first week, which is 24,000 bars. 

Now, if we add up what he made in the first three weeks, that's 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000, which equals 36,000 bars. 

So, to find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we take the total he makes in a month, 50,000 bars, and subtract what he already made, 36,000 bars.

   - In a month with 4 weeks, she spends \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes on videos.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.

   - In a month with 4 weeks, she spends \( 90 \times 4 = 360 \) minutes on makeup.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Videos: 288 minutes
- Songs: 480 minutes
- Makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a month:
\[ 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 \] minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

The interior design firm charges $129 for installing 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has more stuff than that, so she'll have to pay extra for the extra items.

First, let's see how many extra items Angela has:
- She has 6 mirrors, but the package includes 4, so she has 2 extra mirrors.
- She has 2 chandeliers, but the package includes 1, so she has 1 extra chandelier.
- She has 20 pictures, but the package includes 10, so she has 10 extra pictures.

Now, let's add up all the extra items:
- 2 extra mirrors
- 1 extra chandelier
- 10 extra pictures
- Total extra items: 2 + 1 + 10 = 13

The firm charges $15 for each extra item. So, for 13 extra items, the cost is:
- 13 extra items ร $15 per item = $195

Now, we add the base installation fee to the cost of the extra items:
- Base installation fee: $129
- Cost of extra items: $195
- Total cost: $129 + $195 = $324

So, the total cost for Angela will be:

"Well, let's see. Eva has saved $20. Anthony has $10 more than Eva, so that means Anthony has $30. Now, Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To figure out 40% of $30, I can do this: 40% is the same as 40 out of 100, or 0.4. So, 0.4 times 30 is 12. Add that to Anthony's $30, and Roy has $42.

So, Roy has $42."
"Well, let's see. If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than that, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high. Now, if Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than what Saskay can, that means Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high. And if Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than what Kagiyami can, then Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high. 

Now, to figure out how many feet that is, we need to remember that there are 12 inches in a foot. So, 480 inches divided by 12 inches per foot equals 40 feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Well, let's see. Mason's goin' at 8 miles every hour, right? He rides for 4 hours first, so that's 8 times 4, which is 32 miles. Then, he takes a break, but that don't add to the miles. After his break, he rides for another 6 hours, so that's 8 times 6, which is 48 miles. Now, we just add the miles from both parts of his ride: 32 miles plus 48 miles. That gives us 80 miles in total.

80"
"Well, let's think about this in a simple way. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, that means they're pretty slow, right? Now, turtles are even slower, and they're only going half as fast as the kangaroos. So, if one kangaroo is like two turtles, then 3 kangaroos are like 6 turtles.

If 6 turtles take 18 hours, then 4 turtles would take longer because there are fewer of them. To figure out how much longer, we can think about it like this: if 6 turtles take 18 hours, then 4 turtles would take 18 hours times 6 divided by 4. That's 18 times 1.5, which is 27 hours.

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway.

27"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
3. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the dishes:
- Kora: 20 dishes
- Rory: 40 dishes
- Jada: 80 dishes

Total dishes = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140

So, they all made 140 dishes together.

"Well, let's see. Erika wants a new laptop that costs $600. But if she trades in her old one, it'll cost her $400 instead. She got $150 from her part-time job, and her mom gave her $80. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop. 

So, let's add up what she has:
- From her job: $150
- From her mom: $80
- She still needs: $50 more

That means she has $400 - $50 = $350 already. 

Now, if we take away what she got from her job and her mom, we can find out what she had in her purse:
- $350 - $150 - $80 = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"Well, let's see. If a big apple gives you 5 slices and a little one gives you 3, and Adam slices up 3 big ones and 5 little ones, that's a lot of slices!

For the big apples:
3 big apples * 5 slices each = 15 slices

For the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices each = 15 slices

So, all together, that's:
15 slices (from big apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Now, if Adam eats 15 slices, we take those away:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices left

So, Adam has 15 slices left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Patrick has three glue sticks, and each one is partly used. We need to find out how much of each glue stick is left and then add those amounts together.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. If a glue stick is 12 millimeters long, then 1/6 of 12 millimeters is:
   \[
   12 \div 6 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. So, 2/3 of 12 millimeters is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. So, 1/2 of 12 millimeters is:
   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue that is left:
\[
2 \text{ millimeters} + 8 \text{ millimeters} + 6 \text{ millimeters} = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Well, let's see. Gabriel wants to buy a car and a phone. The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800. So, the total cost is $10000 + $800, which is $10800.

Now, Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. So, he has $5000 + $200, which is $5200.

To find out how much more he needs, we take the total cost and subtract what he already has. So, $10800 - $5200 is $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

5600"
"Well, let's see. Thea gave the craftsman four twenty-dollar bills, so that's eighty dollars. The hat cost seventy dollars. So, if you take seventy from eighty, she should get ten dollars back.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so he starts with:
20 + 20 = 40 dollars.

He buys six squirt guns, and each one costs 2 dollars, so:
6 ร 2 = 12 dollars for the squirt guns.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons, and each pack costs 3 dollars, so:
3 ร 3 = 9 dollars for the water balloons.

Now, let's add up how much he spent:
12 + 9 = 21 dollars.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract what he spent from what he started with:
40 - 21 = 19 dollars.

So, Craig has 19 dollars left. 

19"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles or something.

Jack has 60 dishes. That's a lot of dishes! Now, the problem says Jack has twice as many dishes as socks. So, if Jack has 60 dishes, he must have half that many socks. 

So, Jack has:
- 60 dishes
- 30 socks (because 60 divided by 2 is 30)

Now, Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has:
- 60 socks (because 30 times 2 is 60)

And Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has:
- 30 dishes (because 60 divided by 2 is 30)

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes they have together:
- Total socks: 30 (Jack) + 60 (Peter) = 90 socks
- Total dishes: 60 (Jack) + 30 (Peter) = 90 dishes

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
- 90 socks + 90 dishes = 180

"Well, let's see. There are 20 kids in the class. 5 of 'em are good at math, but not so much at English. 8 of 'em are good at English, but not so much at math. That leaves the rest who are good at both. 

So, if we take the 5 who are good at math and the 8 who are good at English, that's 13 kids. The rest, which is 20 minus 13, must be the ones good at both. That's 7 kids.

Now, to find out how many are good at math, we add the 5 who are good at math only and the 7 who are good at both. So, 5 plus 7 is 12.

"Well, let's see. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. There's a 10-minute break, so that leaves 110 minutes for the groups to perform. Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to play, and 2 minutes to leave. That's 10 minutes for each group. So, if we divide 110 minutes by 10 minutes per group, we get 11 groups. 

11 groups can perform in the concert."
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way. Brenda put $300 into a savings plan. This plan gives her extra money each year, and the extra money is three-quarters of the $300 she put in.

1. First, figure out how much extra money she gets each year:
   - Three-quarters of $300 is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars.

2. Now, she gets this extra money every year for 3 years. So, we need to find out how much extra money she gets in total over 3 years:
   - \( 225 \times 3 = 675 \) dollars.

3. Finally, add the extra money to the original $300 to find out how much she has in total after 3 years:
   - \( 300 + 675 = 975 \) dollars.

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have:

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

The store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. 

- Half of the white shirts have collars, so that means 20 white shirts have collars and 20 don't.
- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons, so 30 don't have buttons.

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are compared to white shirts without collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts without collars: 20

So, 30 - 20 = 10

There are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.

"Well, let's see. Mr. Smith had 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so that leaves 45 goats in Farm X. He sold twice as many from Farm Y, which means he sold 20 goats from there, leaving 25 goats in Farm Y. Now, if we add the goats left in both farms, that's 45 goats in Farm X and 25 goats in Farm Y, which makes 70 goats altogether.

Next, a basket of red food costs $18. If you buy 3 of these, you'd pay:
\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \]

But, you get $2 off for each basket of red food. So, for 3 baskets, you save:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

So, the total cost for the red food after the discount is:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]

Now, add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, you'll have to pay:

- If I'm \( x \) years old, then my brother is \( x + 3 \) years old.
- My sister is \( x - 2 \) years old.
- My mom is \( 3 \times (x + 3) - 1 \) years old.

Now, we add all these ages together:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3 \times (x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify it:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 78 \]

On the first day, 10 people get sick. Each of these 10 people makes 6 more people sick. So, on the second day, we have:

10 people * 6 = 60 new sick people.

Now, we add the 60 new sick people to the original 10, so we have 70 sick people in total after the first day.

On the second day, each of these 70 sick people makes 6 more people sick. So, we have:

70 people * 6 = 420 new sick people.

Now, we add the 420 new sick people to the 70 from the first day, so we have 490 sick people in total after the second day.

On the third day, each of these 490 sick people makes 6 more people sick. So, we have:

490 people * 6 = 2940 new sick people.

Now, we add the 2940 new sick people to the 490 from the second day, so we have 3430 sick people in total after the third day.

So, after three days, 3430 people are sick.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Claire gets 1 badge every month. So, in a year, which is 12 months, she gets 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to get a badge as Claire. So, if Claire gets 1 badge in a month, Amber gets 1 badge in 2 months. In a year, Amber gets 6 badges because 12 months divided by 2 is 6.

Wendy gets three times as many badges as Claire in the same time. So, if Claire gets 12 badges in a year, Wendy gets 3 times that, which is 36 badges.

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy gets compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber gets from the number of badges Wendy gets. So, 36 badges minus 6 badges is 30 badges.

Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting things in my head.

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so that means they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.
3. They have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so that means they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.
4. The rink has 75 cars in total.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52 cars.

To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring out a puzzle.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's start by figuring out how many books Anne has. If Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, we can say that Anne has \( F - 12 \) books, where \( F \) is the number of books Fawn has.

Next, since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books. Simplifying that, Sofie has \( F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know the total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Let's add these up:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( F \):
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of jello Greg needs. Each box makes 10 jello cups. So, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of cups each box makes:
\[ 120 \text{ jello cups} \div 10 \text{ jello cups per box} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to know how much it will cost. Each box costs $1.25. So, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. First, we know that Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 on groceries each month.
2. Madeline pays 60% of that. So, we need to find out what 60% of $400 is:
   - 60% of 400 is \( 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \) dollars.
3. That means Madeline pays $240.
4. Since the total is $400, Keenan pays the rest:
   - \( 400 - 240 = 160 \) dollars.
5. Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends each week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way:

1. **First Day:**
   - Tobias had a big pizza with 60 pieces.
   - He ate 2 out of every 5 pieces.
   - So, he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \) pieces.

2. **Second Day:**
   - After the first day, he had \( 60 - 24 = 36 \) pieces left.
   - He ate 10 more pieces.
   - So, he ate \( 24 + 10 = 34 \) pieces by the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - After the second day, he had \( 36 - 10 = 26 \) pieces left.
   - He ate 7 out of every 13 pieces left.
   - So, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \) pieces.

"Well, let's see. If Ella made $33 for 3 hours of dog walking, that means she makes $11 for each hour. If she works for 12 hours, you just multiply 11 by 12. So, 11 times 12 is 132. 

132"
"Well, let's see. Paul had 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more. So, that's 52 plus 28, which makes 80 marbles. Then, he lost a quarter of them. A quarter of 80 is 20. So, if he lost 20 marbles, he's left with 80 minus 20, which is 60 marbles.

60"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Amy took a history test with different types of questions. Here's what we know:

- She got 80% of the multiple-choice questions right. There were 10 multiple-choice questions, and each is worth 1 point.
- She got 90% of the true/false questions right. There were 20 true/false questions, and each is worth 1 point.
- She got 60% of the long-answer questions right. There were 5 long-answer questions, and each is worth 5 points.

First, let's figure out how many points she got from each type of question:

1. **Multiple-Choice Questions:**
   - 80% of 10 questions is \( 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \) questions.
   - Each question is worth 1 point, so she got \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) points.

2. **True/False Questions:**
   - 90% of 20 questions is \( 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \) questions.
   - Each question is worth 1 point, so she got \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) points.

3. **Long-Answer Questions:**
   - 60% of 5 questions is \( 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \) questions.
   - Each question is worth 5 points, so she got \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) points.

Now, let's add up all the points she got:
\[ 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \]

So, Amy scored 41 points on the test.

41"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Isaias has 300 chickens and he plans to sell 3 out of every 5 chickens. So, he's selling:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens} \]

He sells each chicken for $50, so the total money he makes from selling 180 chickens is:
\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars} \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. This means the money he spent to buy the chickens is:
\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens for:
\[ 7000 \]"
"Well, let's see. Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. That means the boys together sold 32 - 14, which is 18 glasses. Since Micah and Mitchell sold the same number, they each sold 18 divided by 2, which is 9 glasses each. So, Julie sold 14 glasses, and Micah sold 9 glasses. Julie sold 14 - 9, which is 5 more glasses than Micah.

5"
"Well, let's see. Iris spent $400 on her hair. For the manicure, she spent a quarter of that, which is $100. Then, for the pedicure, she spent three-quarters of what she spent on the manicure, which is $75. So, if we add all that up, it's $400 for the hair, $100 for the manicure, and $75 for the pedicure. That makes a total of $575.

575"
"Well, let's see. Sarah's got a rope that's 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, if we do the math, that's 20 times 2, which gives us $40. 

Now, Sarah wants to buy a new rope with that money, and the new rope costs $1.5 a meter. So, for 20 meters, that would be 20 times 1.5, which is $30.

So, if Sarah sells her rope for $40 and spends $30 on a new one, she'll have $40 minus $30 left, which is $10.

10"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out myself.

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18. So, if we count back 10 years from 18, we can find out how old she is right now. 

18 - 10 = 8

So, Melanie is 8 years old right now.

Now, we want to know when she will be three times her current age. Three times 8 is:

3 ร 8 = 24

So, we need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old. Since she is 8 now, we need to figure out the difference between 24 and 8:

24 - 8 = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie will be 24, which is three times her current age.

16"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my coins at the store.

First, Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, each pack of bacon costs:
\[ 10 \div 5 = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

Next, she has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, each packet of chicken costs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
For 6 packets, that's:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4. So, for 3 packs, that's:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, she has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, each pack of apples costs:
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
For 7 packs, that's:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kellyโs budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Kelly has 5 dollars left in her budget."
"Well, let's see. Elaina made her final concert twice as long as her usual ones and added a 15-minute encore. The whole thing lasted 65 minutes. So, if we take away the 15 minutes for the encore, that leaves us with 50 minutes. Since the concert was twice as long as usual, we just need to split those 50 minutes in half. That means her usual concerts are 25 minutes long.

25"
"Well, let's see. Argo had 200 toys. He gave 40 to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. So, that's 40 + 80 + 30, which is 150 toys given away. If he started with 200 and gave away 150, he's left with 200 - 150, which is 50 toys.

50"
"Well, let's see. On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas. On Wednesdays, they make another 125 chimichangas. And on Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, so that's 250 chimichangas. If we add all those up, it's 125 plus 125 plus 250, which gives us 500 chimichangas in total.

500"
"Well, let's see. The singer has 50 microphones, but 20% of them can't be paired up. First, we need to figure out how many microphones that 20% is. 

20% of 50 is 10. So, 10 microphones can't be paired up. That leaves us with 50 - 10 = 40 microphones that can be paired up.

Now, to find out how many pairs we can make with 40 microphones, we divide 40 by 2, because each pair has 2 microphones.

40 divided by 2 is 20.

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20"
"Well, let's see. Jerry saw 6 birds in the bushes. Then, he saw 2 outta every 3 of those birds flying overhead, so that's 4 birds. He also saw 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding, which is 24 birds. 

Now, if we add 'em all up:
6 birds in the bushes,
4 birds flying,
24 birds feeding.

That makes 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds in total.

34"
"Well, let's see. Lani made 55 cookies. She ate 5 of 'em, so that leaves 50 cookies. She put those 50 cookies in 5 jars, so if you split 50 cookies into 5 jars, each jar gets 10 cookies.

10"
"Well, let's see. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the orchids have 5 times 5, which is 25 petals in total.

Now, she also has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the daisies have 4 times 10, which is 40 petals in total.

To find out how many more petals the daisies have, we take the 40 petals from the daisies and subtract the 25 petals from the orchids. That's 40 minus 25, which is 15.

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we know there are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of these plants are indoor plants. So, we need to find out how many that is:
\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Now, we have 100 plants total, and 25 of them are indoor plants. So, the number of plants left is:
\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Next, two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we need to find out how many that is:
\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Now, we have 75 plants left, and 50 of them are outdoor plants. So, the number of flowering plants is:
\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we take the number of flowering plants and divide it by the total number of plants, then multiply by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of flowering plants is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. If a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, then a thingamabob spins at:

\[ \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob. So, if a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, then a whirligig spins at:

\[ 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

So, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

1. Ellen eats a salad, a yogurt, and two carrots every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt costs half as much as the salad, so that's $3.
4. So, the salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9.
5. Ellen pays $11 in total for all her food.
6. That means the two carrots must cost $11 - $9 = $2.
7. Since she eats two carrots, one carrot must cost $2 รท 2 = $1.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"Well, let's see. Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's 40 hours a week. He used to make $10 an hour, but now he makes $12 an hour because they gave him a $2 raise. So, if he makes $12 an hour and works 40 hours a week, he makes:

$12 * 40 = $480

So, Mark makes $480 a week.

480"
"Well, let's see. Tasha made $80 last month. She mowed Joe's lawn a few times, and Joe paid her $6. Now, if she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as much as Joe's and Alba's lawn five times as much as Joe's, that means she did a lot of mowing!

If Joe paid her $6 for all the mowing, and she mowed a bunch of lawns, we need to figure out how many times she mowed. If Joe's lawn was mowed once, then Kamala's was mowed three times, and Alba's was mowed five times. That's a total of 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 times mowing lawns.

If she made $6 for all the mowing, and she mowed 9 times, that means she made $6 for all 9 times. So, the money from mowing is $6.

Now, if she made $80 in total and $6 was from mowing, the rest must be from selling lemonade. So, $80 - $6 = $74.

So, Tasha made $74 from selling lemonade.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. Martin weighs 55 kg.
2. Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin. So, Carl's weight is:
   \[
   55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg}
   \]
3. Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl. So, Christian's weight is:
   \[
   71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian. So, Harry's weight is:
   \[
   79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}

So, Harry weighs 74 kg.

"Well, let's see. John rents his car out 10 times a month, and each time it's for 3 hours. So, that's 10 times 3, which is 30 hours a month. He gets paid $25 for each hour. So, 30 hours times $25 is $750. His car payment is $500. So, if he makes $750 and his car payment is $500, he has $750 minus $500 left over. That's $250.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has 7. So, before she bought more, she had:

7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:

3 ร 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we do:

7 - 6 = 1

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

1"
"Well, let's see. Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed a bit more, 1/5 more to be exact. So, 1/5 of 50 miles is 10 miles. That means Anis rowed 50 miles plus 10 miles, which is 60 miles. Now, if we add what both of them rowed, it's 50 miles for Dijana and 60 miles for Anis, which gives us 110 miles in total.

110"
"Well, let's see. Susan made 100 cookies, but her husband took 4. So, that leaves 96 cookies. If she wants to split these equally among her 6 nephews, we just need to divide 96 by 6.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

Daniel didn't read any pages today, so he still has 13 pages total.

Now, let's add up the pages Denise read:
- Yesterday: 10 pages
- Today: 18 pages
- Total: 10 + 18 = 28 pages

So, Denise read 28 pages in total, and Daniel read 13 pages in total.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract:
28 - 13 = 15

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows how to count and share things.

Calvin's got a pot of soup that can fill 4 big bowls or 8 little bowls. He's an adult, and so is his wife, and they have two kids. Each person is gonna have one bowl at dinner.

So, Calvin and his wife will each have one big bowl. That's 2 big bowls. Since 1 big bowl is the same as 2 little bowls, 2 big bowls are the same as 4 little bowls.

The pot has enough for 8 little bowls, and they're using 4 little bowls' worth for dinner. So, after dinner, there will be 4 little bowls of soup left.

Calvin has two kids, and each kid will have one little bowl at a meal. So, with 4 little bowls left, each kid can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"Okay, let's figure this out. William bought 5 notebooks and 1 ballpen. The notebooks cost $1.50 each, and the ballpen costs $0.50.

First, we need to find out how much the notebooks cost:
- 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 times 1.50, which is 7.50.

Next, we add the cost of the ballpen:
- The ballpen costs $0.50.

Now, we add the two amounts together:
- 7.50 (notebooks) + 0.50 (ballpen) = 8.00.

So, William spent a total of $8.00.

"Well, let's see. If Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, that means each small mask needs half a yard. So, for 20 small masks, she'd need 10 yards of material.

Now, for the large masks, if 3 large masks need 2 and a quarter yards, then each large mask needs three-quarters of a yard. So, for 8 large masks, she'd need 6 yards of material.

Add 'em up, and Jo needs 10 yards for the small masks and 6 yards for the large masks. That's 16 yards in total.

- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

That's 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so if we take away the 19 hours he spends on those things, he's got 24 - 19 = 5 hours left for free time.

"Well, let's see. Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue ones and a third of the red ones to go fishing. 

First, we figure out how many red shoe boxes he uses. A third of 9 is 3. So, he uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, we subtract the ones he used from what he had:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left. That's a total of 10 shoe boxes left.

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. We know there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna he threw at the red balloons:
- 2 pieces per red balloon
- 20 red balloons
- So, 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna for the red balloons

Now, we know the total pieces of bologna thrown is 58. So, the pieces thrown at the yellow balloons would be:
- 58 total pieces - 40 pieces for red balloons = 18 pieces for yellow balloons

Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna. So, to find out how many yellow balloons there are:
- 18 pieces / 3 pieces per yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"Well, let's see. If each of the 30 kids sold 10 lollipops, that's 300 lollipops in total. They sold each lollipop for 80 cents, so they made 300 times 80 cents, which is 240 dollars. But they bought the lollipops for 50 cents each, so they spent 300 times 50 cents, which is 150 dollars. So, the money they raised is the money they made minus the money they spent, which is 240 dollars minus 150 dollars. That's 90 dollars.

90"
"Well, let's see here. Larry's got 3 cats. He's got 3 times as many dogs as cats, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 dogs. He's got 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so that's 9 minus 2, which is 7 rabbits. He's got a fish tank with 3 times the number of fish as rabbits, so that's 3 times 7, which is 21 fish. He's also got gerbils, and he's got 1/3 the number of fish, so that's 21 divided by 3, which is 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add 'em all up:
- 3 cats

- 7 rabbits
- 21 fish
- 7 gerbils

So, 3 plus 9 plus 7 plus 21 plus 7 is 47.

Larry has 47 pets."

Now, if they use 500 gallons each day, after 6 days, they would have used 500 times 6, which is 3,000 gallons. So, if the tank started with 5,000 gallons and they used 3,000 gallons, there would be 5,000 minus 3,000, which is 2,000 gallons left in the tank.

"Well, let's see. Colby's parents give him $150 for the movies each month. He's already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, which cost $10 each, and 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each. He also had 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy.

First, let's figure out how much he spent on the movies:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 times $10 is $50.
- 8 movies on other days: 8 times $7 is $56.

Now, let's add the cost of the popcorn and candy:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 times $8 is $16.
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 times $2 is $8.

So, the total he's spent so far is:
- Movies: $50 + $56 = $106.
- Snacks: $16 + $8 = $24.
- Total spent: $106 + $24 = $130.

He started with $150, so he has:
- $150 - $130 = $20 left.

On the last day, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. That will cost:
- Movie: $10.
- Popcorn: $8.
- Candy: $2.
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Since he has exactly $20 left, he can afford to see one more movie, get a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy.

So, the total number of movies he can see this month is:
- 5 + 8 + 1 = 14 movies.

"Well, let's see. Andrew made a bunch of little pastries. He made 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. Now, a big cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a big blueberry muffin has 450 calories. But these are mini, so they only have a third of the calories.

First, let's figure out the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A big cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini one has 600 divided by 3, which is 200 calories.
- He made 200 of these, so 200 times 200 is 40,000 calories.

Next, for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A big blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini one has 450 divided by 3, which is 150 calories.
- He made 300 of these, so 300 times 150 is 45,000 calories.

Now, we add the calories from both types of pastries:
- 40,000 plus 45,000 is 85,000 calories.

So, the total number of calories in all the pastries Andrew baked is:
85,000"
"Well, let's see. Rita picked some Junebugs off her plants each day. Here's what I got:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so that's 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: Again, twice as many as Monday, so that's another 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, to find out the average, we need to add all these up and then divide by the number of days, which is 5.

So, let's add 'em up:
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

Now, we divide 300 by 5:
300 รท 5 = 60

So, Rita picks an average of 60 Junebugs per day.

"Well, let's see. The bus goes 60 miles every hour and it travels for 5 hours. So, the bus goes 60 times 5, which is 300 miles.

Now, the car goes 30 miles every hour and it travels for 8 hours. So, the car goes 30 times 8, which is 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went, we take the miles the bus went and subtract the miles the car went. That's 300 minus 240, which is 60 miles.

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring out a puzzle.

First, we know that Peter, Paul, and Jean together are 100 years old. That's a big number!

Next, we know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean. So if Jean is, say, 20 years old, then Paul would be 30 years old.

Lastly, we know that Peter's age is the same as the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages. So if Jean is 20 and Paul is 30, then Peter would be 50 years old.

Now, let's put it all together:

1. If Jean is 20, Paul is 30, and Peter is 50, then:
   - Jean (20) + Paul (30) + Peter (50) = 100

That adds up to 100, which is what we need!

So, Peter is 50 years old.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, Maria gives each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, that's 4 friends times 2 balloons each:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Then, Maria has 1 water balloon for herself:
\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \]

Next, Maria's mom comes out and gives each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends):
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Now, we add the 15 balloons from Maria's mom to the 9 balloons they already had:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

Then, they already have 10 more boxes. So, we add those:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, each table can hold 2 boxes. So, we need to find out how many tables we need for 60 boxes:
\[ 60 \div 2 = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already have 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

So, they need 15 new tables.

"Well, let's see here. Zoey spits 40 seeds, and each one goes 10 feet. So, that's 40 times 10, which is 400 feet. Sydney spits 35 seeds, and each one goes 12 feet. So, that's 35 times 12, which is 420 feet. Now, to find the average, we add 400 and 420, which gives us 820 feet. Then we divide 820 by 2, because there are two of them. So, 820 divided by 2 is 410 feet.

"Well, let's see. If the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, and they both run 24 hours a day for 30 days, we need to figure out how many more widgets the Widgeteer 3000 makes and how much more money that is.

First, let's find out how many widgets each one makes in a day:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in a day (24 hours), it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in a day (24 hours), it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.

Now, let's see how many widgets each one makes in a month (30 days):
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 1440 widgets a day, so in a month, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 widgets a day, so in a month, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Next, let's find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes:
- Each widget sells for $6.
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 widgets, so it makes 43200 * 6 = $259200.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 widgets, so it makes 32400 * 6 = $194400.

Finally, let's find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The difference is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000.

"Cameron comes in at 5 in the evening and leaves at 10 in the morning the next day. That's 17 hours. The hotel says 12 hours cost 1000 pesos, and after that, it's 70 pesos for each extra hour.

So, for the first 12 hours, he pays 1000 pesos. For the extra 5 hours, he pays 70 pesos each, which is 350 pesos more.

So, he pays 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

If he paid for 24 hours, it would be 1600 pesos. So, he saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

"Well, let's see. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and there are 15 goats. So, for the goats, that's 5 pounds times 15, which is 75 pounds of hay.

Now, for the sheep, each one needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs. So, twice what a goat needs is 10 pounds, and 3 pounds less than that is 7 pounds. There are 12 sheep, so that's 7 pounds times 12, which is 84 pounds of hay.

Add the hay for the goats and the sheep together, and you get 75 pounds plus 84 pounds, which is 159 pounds of hay.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

He wants to put 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

He buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each, so that's:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, he has:

Patty's Plumbing charges:
- $40 just to come to your house.

- They also used $60 worth of parts.

First, we figure out how much they charged for the work:
- 2.25 hours times $35 per hour is 2.25 * 35 = $78.75.

Now, we add everything up:
- $40 for coming to the house
- $78.75 for the work
- $60 for the parts

So, $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75.

Patty charged $178.75.

But he gets a 40% discount on these CDs. To find out how much he saves, we calculate 40% of $150:

\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, he saves $60. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much he actually paid:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James then decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. So, he gets $40 back.

To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the $40 he got from selling the CDs from the $90 he paid:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

Lastly, she's got 4 carrots, and each carrot sells for $1.25. So, for the carrots, she'd make 4 times $1.25, which is $5.

Now, if we add all that up, $9 from the yams, $20 from the sweet potatoes, and $5 from the carrots, Jen would make a total of $34 if she sells everything.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way:

1. **First Swim:**
   - James swims 60% of 20 miles.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - He swims at 2 miles per hour.
   - Time for the first part: \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Rest:**
   - He rests for half the time he swam.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

3. **Second Swim:**
   - He has 8 miles left to swim (20 miles - 12 miles).
   - He swims at half his original speed, so 1 mile per hour.
   - Time for the second part: \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = First swim + Rest + Second swim
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

So, it took James 17 hours to get across the lake.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Cayley sells newspapers and gets a little bit of money for each one he sells. For the New York Times, he gets 10% of the price for each copy. For the Wall Street Journal, he gets 8% of the price for each copy.

First, let's figure out how much he makes from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- He gets 10% of $5, which is $0.50 for each copy.
- He sells 6 copies, so he makes 6 times $0.50, which is $3.00.

Next, let's figure out how much he makes from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He gets 8% of $15, which is $1.20 for each copy.
- He sells 10 copies, so he makes 10 times $1.20, which is $12.00.

Now, let's add up the money he makes from both newspapers:
- From the New York Times, he makes $3.00.
- From the Wall Street Journal, he makes $12.00.
- In total, he makes $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out on my own.

So, Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. Bahati scored the most, and he scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. We need to find out how many points Azibo scored.

First, let's say Bahati scored \( B \) points. According to the problem:
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored \( B - 20 \) points.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored \( B - 10 \) points.

Now, we know the total points scored by all three is 45:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Let's add these up:
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Now, let's solve for \( B \):
\[ 3B = 45 + 30 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

So, Bahati scored 25 points. Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ A = 25 - 20 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

If we break it down, 15 hours is the same as 15 times 60 minutes, which is 900 minutes. Now, if he staples for 900 minutes and he does 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to figure out how many 15-minute chunks are in 900 minutes. 

900 divided by 15 is 60. So, he staples for 60 chunks of 15 minutes. If he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute chunk, then he staples 60 times 30 reports. 

60 times 30 is 1800. So, Vince staples 1800 reports.

Then, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so that's 5 more minutes she wasn't in bed sleeping.

So, we take the 480 minutes she usually sleeps and subtract the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking and the 5 minutes she woke up early.

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

He gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the measuring cups to find the total number of utensils he has left:

So, 200 beds are already taken.

Now, every day, 50 more people are coming in. We need to know how many days are in 2 weeks:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]
So, 14 days in 2 weeks.

If 50 people come in each day for 14 days, that's:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \]
So, 700 more people will be admitted in 2 weeks.

Now, we add the 200 beds that are already taken to the 700 new beds:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]
So, 900 beds will be taken after 2 weeks.

Finally, to find out how many beds are still free, we subtract the 900 taken beds from the total 1000 beds:
\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, after 2 weeks, there will be 100 unoccupied beds.

9 รท 3 = 3 (one-third)
3 ร 2 = 6 (two-thirds)

So, 6 emails are to family. Now we need to find out how many are left for her boyfriend:

48 = 120% of the real number

To find 100%, we divide 48 by 1.2 (which is the same as 120%):

"Alright, let's break this down in a simple way.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. But they filled in 2 holes on the third day because they kept falling in. So, the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2, which is 6 holes.

Now, let's add up all the holes they dug by the end of the third day:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes.

The problem says that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. They dug 10 holes on the first day, so four times that is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes.

So, by the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes. We already know there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, so the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is:
40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

First, we know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together caught 339 Pokemon. That's a lot of Pokemon!

Next, we know that Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan. So if Stan caught \( S \) Pokemon, then Alex caught \( S + 5 \) Pokemon.

We also know that Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe. If Adelwolfe caught \( A \) Pokemon, then Stan caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.

Now, let's put all this together. We have:
- Adelwolfe caught \( A \) Pokemon.
- Stan caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
- Alex caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 \) Pokemon, which simplifies to \( 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339, so we can write:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( A \):
\[ 9A = 339 + 21 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, let's find out how many Pokemon Stan caught:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"Well, let's see. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes in one episode. So, if one episode is 20 minutes, then there must be 10 episodes, 'cause 20 divided by 2 is 10. If John watches all 10 episodes, and each one is 20 minutes, then he'll spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"Well, let's see. The bird flew south for 10 hours at 30 miles an hour, so that's 300 miles. Then, it flew back north for 2 hours at 18 miles an hour, which is 36 miles. Finally, it flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles an hour, which is 110 miles.

So, the bird flew 300 miles south, then 36 miles back north, and then another 110 miles south. To find out how far the bird's home is from where it started, we need to add the miles it flew south and subtract the miles it flew north.

300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles (flying south)
410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

374"
"Well, let's see. Greta made herself a batch of 12 brownies. Her office gave her half a dozen, which is 6 more brownies. Her friends surprised her with 4 dozen, which is 48 brownies. So, she had:

12 (her batch) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies.

During the party, they ate 1 and a half dozen, which is 18 brownies. So, the brownies left are:

66 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day. 

48"
"Well, let's see. Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so that makes his brother 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she's a quarter less than 8. A quarter of 8 is 2, so she's 6 years old. Now, if we add all their ages together, we get 8 + 16 + 6, which is 30.

30"
"Well, let's see. I got 12 racquets to string. Three of 'em need synthetic gut, five need polyester, and four need a mix of both. 

For the synthetic gut, it takes me about 15 minutes each. So, for 3 racquets, that's 15 times 3, which is 45 minutes.

For the polyester, it takes me 22 minutes each. So, for 5 racquets, that's 22 times 5, which is 110 minutes.

For the mix, it takes me 18 minutes each. So, for 4 racquets, that's 18 times 4, which is 72 minutes.

Now, I add 'em all up: 45 minutes for the synthetic gut, 110 minutes for the polyester, and 72 minutes for the mix. That's 45 plus 110 plus 72, which is 227 minutes.

So, it'll take me 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"Well, let's see. John's buyin' phones for him, his wife, and his two kids. That's four phones. The first two phones cost $600 each. So, that's $600 plus $600, which is $1200 for the first two. The other two phones are half price, so that's $300 each. So, $300 plus $300 is $600 for the last two. Now, add 'em all up: $1200 plus $600 is $1800.

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

"Well, let's see. If Carlton's team has 13 players, and Zeke's team has 7 more players than that, then Zeke's team must have 20 players. So, if we add the players from both teams together, that's 13 plus 20, which gives us 33 players in total.

33"
"Well, let's see. Robert is building a fence around his garden. The garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. To figure out how many wooden slats he needs, we first gotta find out how much fencing he's gonna build.

The fence goes all the way around, so we add up all the sides:
- Two sides are 15 feet each, so that's 15 + 15 = 30 feet.
- The other two sides are 10 feet each, so that's 10 + 10 = 20 feet.
- Add those together: 30 + 20 = 50 feet of fencing.

Now, for every foot of fencing, Robert needs 2 wooden slats. So, we multiply the total feet of fencing by 2:
- 50 feet ร 2 slats per foot = 100 slats.

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"Well, let's see. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, she gave away 4 boxes. That leaves her with 12 - 4, which is 8 boxes.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the 8 boxes for herself. One quarter of 8 is 2 boxes. So, she kept 2 boxes and sold the rest. The rest would be 8 - 2, which is 6 boxes.

Each box has 20 oranges, so 6 boxes would have 6 times 20 oranges. That's 120 oranges.

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

"Well, let's see. I heard the USA has 50 states. Now, if India has 4 more than half of that, we need to figure out what half of 50 is. Half of 50 is 25. So, if India has 4 more than 25, that means India has 29 states. 

Now, to find out how many states there are in total, we just add the states in the USA and India together. So, 50 plus 29 is 79.

79"
"Well, let's see. Tyler wants to buy a dictionary for $18, a dinosaur book for $13, and a cookbook for $8. That's a total of $18 + $13 + $8, which is $39. He's got $14 already saved up. So, he needs $39 - $14, which is $25 more. If he earns $5 for each hour he works, he needs to work $25 รท $5, which is 5 hours. So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to get the rest of the money for his books.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Robert has 30 cherries, and he has 10 more than Richard. So, Richard must have 20 cherries because 30 - 10 = 20.

Now, we know Robert has 30 cherries and Richard has 20 cherries. Together, they have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries.

Since there are 60 cherries in total, Jerry must have the rest. So, Jerry has 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 30 - 10 = 20.

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie. So, he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the boxes he sold over the two days:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes on Saturday + 15 boxes on Sunday = 25 boxes
- Apple pie: 6 boxes on Saturday + 15 boxes on Sunday = 21 boxes

Next, we need to figure out how much money he made. The gingerbread costs $6 a box, and the apple pie costs $15 a box.

For the gingerbread:
- 25 boxes * $6/box = $150

For the apple pie:
- 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

Now, we add the money from both the gingerbread and the apple pie:
- $150 + $315 = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour. She's outside for 4 hours each day. So, she uses:
1 ounce/hour ร 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day

She's on vacation for 8 days, so she will use:
4 ounces/day ร 8 days = 32 ounces

Each bottle of sunscreen has 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle:
32 ounces รท 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Well, let's see. If the blue car costs $100 and the red car is 40% cheaper, that means the red car costs 60% of what the blue car costs. So, 60% of $100 is $60. Add that to the $100 for the blue car, and both cars together cost $160.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

1. **Emil's Age Now:**
   - Emil is 19 years old right now.

2. **Emil's Age in 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

3. **Emil's Dad's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - So, Emil's dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

4. **Emil's Dad's Current Age:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, he is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.

5. **Emil's Brother's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - So, Emil's brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

6. **Emil's Brother's Current Age:**
   - Since Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, he is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.

7. **Sum of Their Ages Now:**
   - Emil's dad is 43 years old.
   - Emil's brother is 7 years old.
   - The sum of their ages is 43 + 7 = 50.

So, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:

"Well, lemme see now. Adrianne got 20 shiny beads from her mom. Her sister gave her 10 more than her mom, so that's 30 more beads. Her friend gave her twice what her mom gave, so that's 40 more beads. Now, if we add 'em all up: 20 from her mom, 30 from her sister, and 40 from her friend, that makes 90 beads in total.

"Well, let's see. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that, so that's 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of what he got on Friday, so that's 6 pounds. 

Now, if we add all that up: 3 pounds on Thursday, 12 pounds on Friday, and 6 pounds on Saturday, that's 21 pounds total.

If one serving is 3 pounds, then we divide 21 by 3 to find out how many servings that is. So, 21 divided by 3 is 7.

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

"Well, let's see. In Mr. Roper's class, there are 30 students. Now, 20% of them are football players. That means 20 out of 100, so 6 students are football players.

Now, we have 30 students minus the 6 football players, which leaves us with 24 students. Out of these 24, 25% are cheerleaders or in the band. So, 25 out of 100, that's 6 more students.

So, if 6 football players and 6 cheerleaders or band members are leaving early, that's 12 students in total.

12 students are leaving early."
"Well, let's see. Sophie wears size 5 boots. Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's. So, Charlie's boots are 25. 

To find the average, we add the two sizes together and then divide by 2. That's 5 plus 25, which is 30. Then, 30 divided by 2 is 15.

So, the average size of the boots is 15."
"Well, let's see. Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long. Each flower needs 1 foot of space to grow and 1.5 feet of space between it and the next flower. So, each flower and the space it needs take up 2.5 feet.

To figure out how many flowers can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each flower needs:
111 feet / 2.5 feet per flower = 44.4 flowers. But you can't have a part of a flower, so it's 44 flowers.

Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs:
44 flowers - 17 flowers = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so:
27 flowers * $6 per flower = $162.

So, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"Well, let's see. If Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, and his brother eats half as many, that means his brother eats 9 pretzels a day. Now, to figure out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we just need to count how many days are in a week and multiply that by 9. There are 7 days in a week, so:

9 pretzels a day times 7 days in a week equals 63 pretzels.

"Well, let's see. Katherine wants to fill 5 baskets. In each basket, she wants to put 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. 

The petunias cost $3 each, so for 3 petunias, that's 3 times $3, which is $9. 

The sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each, so for 2 vines, that's 2 times $2.50, which is $5.

So, for one basket, she spends $9 for the petunias and $5 for the vines, which adds up to $14.

Now, she has 5 baskets, so she needs to spend $14 for each basket. That's 5 times $14, which is $70.

So, Katherine will spend $70 to fill all 5 baskets.

Now, if she saves $500 every month, in a year she'll have:

$500 * 12 = $6,000

If each pair of shoes costs $1,000, then she can buy:

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6 pairs of shoes

Now, for cooking, if I can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, then to cook 90 shrimp, I'd need to do:

90 shrimp รท 30 shrimp per batch = 3 batches

And each batch takes 10 minutes, so:

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way:

1. The air conditioner was on low for 3 hours. On low, it cools the room by 2 degrees each hour. So, in 3 hours, it cooled the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. On high, it cools the room by 3 degrees each hour. So, in 4 hours, it cooled the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. When it's off, the room warms up by 2 degrees each hour. So, in 2 hours, the room warmed up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's add up the cooling and warming:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The final temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Well, let's see. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times as old as his dad was when he saw it. So, Bill was 90 years old the second time he saw the comet. The comet comes back every 75 years. So, to find out how old Bill was the first time he saw the comet, we take 90 and subtract 75. That means Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

2. He also writes a check for the gas bill every month. That's another 12 checks a year.
3. He writes 2 checks to the church every month. So, that's 2 checks times 12 months, which is 24 checks a year.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service every three months, which is 4 times a year. So, that's 4 checks a year.

Now, let's add 'em all up:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks a year.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

There are two planes at the airport. The first plane flies to different places, and the second plane only flies to Poland.

The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its trips. The rest of the trips are split equally between France and Germany. So, if the first plane makes 88 trips in a day (because the second plane makes 44 trips, and that's half of what the first plane does), then:

- Three-quarters of 88 trips go to Greece, which is 66 trips.
- The remaining trips are 88 - 66 = 22 trips.
- These 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, so 11 trips go to France and 11 trips go to Germany.

So, the first plane makes 11 trips to France in one day.

"Well, let's see. Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long, so that's 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined, so that's 20 seconds plus 40 seconds, which is 60 seconds.

Now, if we add all their howling times together:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

That's 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 120 seconds is 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

We know the total age of the four kids is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, let's add those up:

3 (Akbar) + 4 (Alessandro) = 7

Now, we need to find out the ages of Helene and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. First, let's find the average age of the group:

20 (total age) รท 4 (number of kids) = 5 (average age)

So, Helene is twice as old as 5:

5 ร 2 = 10

Now we know Helene is 10 years old. We can use this to find Wilfred's age. We already know the total age of the group is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:

3 (Akbar) + 4 (Alessandro) + 10 (Helene) = 17

So, to find Wilfred's age, we subtract the total of the other three kids' ages from 20:

20 - 17 = 3

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church, so that's 1500 divided by 2, which is 750 cookies. If each person at the church got 15 cookies, then we need to find out how many 15s are in 750. That's 750 divided by 15, which is 50. So, 50 people got cookies at the church.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about sharing things fairly.

We've got a watermelon, and we need to share it among 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids. The rule is that each adult gets a slice that's twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's say each kid gets a small slice, and we'll call that slice ""1 part."" Since the adults get twice as much, each adult gets ""2 parts.""

Now, let's count all the parts:
- Each kid gets 1 part, and there are 4 kids, so that's 4 parts.
- Each adult gets 2 parts, and there are 2 adults, so that's 4 parts.

So, in total, we have 4 parts from the kids and 4 parts from the adults, which makes 8 parts in total.

Each adult gets 2 parts out of the 8 parts. To find out what percentage that is, we do this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ parts}}{8 \text{ parts}} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Doctor Jones is at the clinic for 9 hours. That's 9 hours of work time.

First, he has to do rounds to check on 9 inpatients. Each round takes 20 minutes. So, for 9 inpatients, that's:
9 inpatients * 20 minutes each = 180 minutes.

Next, he has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, for 10 appointments, that's:
10 appointments * 30 minutes each = 300 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time he spends on rounds and appointments:
180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

To find out how many hours that is, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
480 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours.

So, Doctor Jones spends 8 hours on rounds and appointments. He has 9 hours in total, so the time left for updating his records is:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

The dance studio costs $25 to rent each time. They also pay $1.50 for each student for each session. There are 10 students, and the studio is used 3 times a week. We need to figure out how much it costs in a month, assuming a month has 4 weeks.

First, let's find out how much it costs for one session:
- Rent: $25
- Cost for students: 10 students * $1.50 = $15
- Total for one session: $25 + $15 = $40

Now, let's find out how much it costs for one week:
- The studio is used 3 times a week.
- Total for one week: $40 * 3 = $120

Finally, let's find out how much it costs for one month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Total for one month: $120 * 4 = $480

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Peter has 4 boxes, and he has a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes, and she has a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:
\[ \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we know there are 50 porcupines in the park. Out of these, 3 out of every 5 porcupines are female. So, to find out how many female porcupines there are, we do:

50 porcupines * (3/5) = 30 female porcupines

Now, each of these female porcupines has 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:

30 female porcupines * 4 babies = 120 babies per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

120 babies per month * 12 months = 1440 babies

Finally, to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we add the initial 50 porcupines to the 1440 babies:

50 porcupines + 1440 babies = 1490 porcupines

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:
\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"Well, let's see. Mr. Smith measured the pool, and it's 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. To figure out how much water it can hold, we need to multiply these numbers together:

14 feet (width) ร 25 feet (length) ร 4 feet (depth) = 1400 cubic feet

Now, the pool company said to multiply this by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

1400 cubic feet ร 5.9 = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so:

8260 gallons ร $0.10 per gallon = $826

So, it will cost $826 to fill the pool.

826"
"Well, let's see. They got 9 red sticks. Now, they said there's 5 more blue sticks than red ones, so that means there's 14 blue sticks. Then, the yellow sticks are 3 less than the blue ones, so that's 11 yellow sticks. 

Now, if we add 'em all up: 9 red, 14 blue, and 11 yellow, that gives us 34 sticks in total.

"Well, let's see. Matteo was goin' 55 miles an hour for 4 hours. So, he went 55 times 4, which is 220 miles. Shandy was cruisin' at 45 miles an hour for 10 hours. That's 45 times 10, which is 450 miles. 

Now, to find out how much farther Shandy went, we take Shandy's miles and subtract Matteo's miles. So, 450 minus 220 is 230 miles.

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"Well, let's see if I can figure this out. The school has 3000 students. Half of them, which is 1500, are over 16 years old. Out of these 1500, one-fourth are boys, so that's 375 boys. That means the rest, 1500 - 375, which is 1125, are girls over 16.

Now, the other half of the students, which is also 1500, are under 16. Half of these, so 750, are boys. That means the rest, 1500 - 750, which is 750, are girls under 16.

So, if we add the girls over 16 and the girls under 16, we get 1125 + 750, which is 1875.

So, the total number of female students is 1875. 

1875"
"Well, let's see. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so that's 14 laps for Trey. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so that's 7 laps for Shaelyn. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 5 laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we just subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps. So, 10 laps minus 5 laps is 5 laps.

"Well, let's see. The tank can hold 18,000 gallons of water. On the first day, Wanda filled up a quarter of the tank, which is 4,500 gallons. Ms. B filled up 3/4 of what Wanda did, so that's 3,375 gallons. Together, they filled up 7,875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda filled up 2/3 of what she did the first day, so that's 3,000 gallons. Ms. B filled up 1/3 of what she did the first day, so that's 1,125 gallons. Together, they filled up 4,125 gallons on the second day.

So, in total, they filled up 7,875 gallons on the first day and 4,125 gallons on the second day, which adds up to 12,000 gallons.

The tank can hold 18,000 gallons, so they still need to fill up 6,000 gallons to make it full.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Maria had her power bank and it was losing charge while her friends were using it. First, it lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. Then, it lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 more hours. In the end, it had 28% charge left.

Let's work backwards to find out how much charge it had when Maria went to the park.

1. **After the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% each hour for 3 hours.
   - If it had 28% left after these 3 hours, we need to figure out how much it had before these 3 hours.
   - Each hour, it lost 7%, so it kept 93% of its charge each hour.
   - So, if it had 28% after 3 hours, before these 3 hours it had:
     \[
     \text{Charge before last 3 hours} = \frac{28\%}{0.93 \times 0.93 \times 0.93}
     \]
   - Calculating that:
     \[
     \text{Charge before last 3 hours} = \frac{28\%}{0.804357} \approx 34.8\%
     \]

2. **After the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% each hour for 5 hours.
   - If it had 34.8% left after these 5 hours, we need to figure out how much it had before these 5 hours.
   - Each hour, it lost 9%, so it kept 91% of its charge each hour.
   - So, if it had 34.8% after 5 hours, before these 5 hours it had:
     \[
     \text{Charge before first 5 hours} = \frac{34.8\%}{0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91}
     \]
   - Calculating that:
     \[
     \text{Charge before first 5 hours} = \frac{34.8\%}{0.59049} \approx 58.9\%
     \]

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was about 58.9%.

58.9%"
"Well, let's see. Janet wants to save up for a car that costs $10,000, but she only needs to save 20% of that for the down payment. So, she needs to save:

\[ 10,000 \times 0.20 = 2,000 \]

Now, Janet makes $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour in tips. So, she makes:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \]

She works 40 hours a week, so she makes:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs by what she makes in a week:

\[ 2,000 \div 1,000 = 2 \]

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

"Well, lemme see now. Jamaar's got $10 to spend at the store. He's already bought some fruits, so let's add up what he's spent:

- 3 peaches at 50 cents each, that's 3 times 50 cents, so $1.50.
- 4 pears at 50 cents each, that's 4 times 50 cents, so $2.00.
- 2 kiwis at $1 each, that's 2 times $1, so $2.00.
- 5 apples at 75 cents each, that's 5 times 75 cents, so $3.75.

Now, let's add all that up: $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25.

So, Jamaar has spent $9.25, and he started with $10. That means he's got $10 - $9.25 = 75 cents left.

Plums cost 25 cents each, so with 75 cents, he can buy 75 cents divided by 25 cents, which is 3 plums.

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"Well, let's see. Anne had a box with 15 packs of sweets, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 13 packs. If you multiply 13 packs by 60 pieces, that's 780 pieces. She gave these 780 pieces to 10 friends, so each friend got 78 pieces.

"Well, let's see. If the price of carrots goes up by 5% each year, we need to figure out what that means after three years. 

First year: 
120 dollars plus 5% of 120 dollars. 
5% of 120 is 6 dollars. 
So, 120 plus 6 is 126 dollars.

Second year: 
Now, 126 dollars plus 5% of 126 dollars. 
5% of 126 is 6.30 dollars. 
So, 126 plus 6.30 is 132.30 dollars.

Third year: 
132.30 dollars plus 5% of 132.30 dollars. 
5% of 132.30 is 6.615 dollars. 
So, 132.30 plus 6.615 is 138.915 dollars.

Rounding that to the nearest dollar, it's about 139 dollars.

"Well, let's see. Olivia put 72 pictures into 8 albums, and she put the same number in each one. So, if we split 72 by 8, that's 9 pictures in each album.

Now, 3 of those albums were just selfies, so that's 3 times 9, which is 27 selfies.

And 2 of the albums were portraits, so that's 2 times 9, which is 18 portraits.

So, if we add the selfies and the portraits together, that's 27 plus 18, which is 45 pictures.

"Well, let's see. If James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, that means he reads 1 page in about 3 and a third minutes. So, if he reads 18 pages, we just multiply 18 by 3 and a third minutes.

James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests left early, so we take away 24 from 100: 
   100 - 24 = 76 guests left.
3. Then, 15 guests left late, so we take away 15 more:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests left.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who left late. Since 15 guests left late, twice that is:
   15 x 2 = 30 guests checked in.
   So we add 30 to the 61 guests:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so we add 7 more:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

So, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

1. **Total Questions:**
   - There are 60 questions in total.

2. **Easy Questions:**
   - 40% of the questions are easy.
   - 40% of 60 is 0.40 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

3. **Average and Difficult Questions:**
   - The rest of the questions are split equally between average and difficult.
   - Total remaining questions = 60 - 24 = 36
   - Number of average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

4. **Questions Aries Gets Correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - 75% of 24 is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions correct.
   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct.
   - Half of 18 is 0.50 * 18 = 9 average questions correct.
   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct.
   - Half of 18 is 0.50 * 18 = 9 difficult questions correct.

5. **Total Correct Questions:**
   - Total correct questions = 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

So, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Okay, let's think about this. Teresa sells big stuffed animals for three times what she sells the small ones for. She sold twice as many small ones as big ones today and made $120 in total. Each small one costs $4.

If each small one is $4, then each big one is $12 because it's three times as much.

Now, let's say she sold \( x \) big ones. That means she sold \( 2x \) small ones because she sold twice as many small ones as big ones.

The money from the small ones would be \( 4 \times 2x \) and the money from the big ones would be \( 12 \times x \).

So, the total money she made is:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, she sold 6 big ones. Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"Well, let's see. The man eats 5 sandwiches a day, the wife eats 4, and the little one eats 2. So, all together, they eat 11 sandwiches each day. Now, if we want to know how many they eat in a week, we just need to count how many days are in a week and multiply that by 11. There are 7 days in a week, so:

11 sandwiches a day times 7 days is 77 sandwiches in a week.

"Well, let's see. The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so that's 60 eggs. There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were left unfound. So, the friends found the rest. 

To figure out how many eggs the friends found, we take the total number of eggs, which is 100, and subtract the 60 eggs the twins found and the 10 eggs that weren't found. 

So, 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The friends found 30 eggs.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's 24 pounds. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so that's 24 pounds plus half of 24 pounds, which is 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 36 pounds of ore in a day.

Now, if one dwarf can mine 36 pounds in a day, 40 dwarves can mine 40 times that amount in a day. So, 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds in a day.

If they work for 30 days, they can mine 30 times that amount. So, 40 dwarves can mine 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"Well, let's see. If 2 sandwiches cost $3, and 4 sandwiches cost $6, it looks like each sandwich costs $1.5. So, if we want to know how much 8 sandwiches would cost, we just multiply 8 by $1.5. That's 8 times 1.5, which is 12. So, the package with 8 sandwiches should cost $12.

To figure out 10% of $2000, you just move the decimal point one place to the left. So, 10% of $2000 is $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"Well, let's see here. Sally had 25 red balloons, but a gust of wind made 40% of them pop. That means 10 red balloons popped, so she had 15 red balloons left.

She also had 12 yellow balloons, but she let go of half of them. So, she let go of 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with 6 yellow balloons.

She still had all 7 green balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree and took 75% of them. That means she took 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons she had left:
- 15 red balloons
- 7 green balloons
- 6 yellow balloons

So, 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.

Sally carried 34 balloons into the school.

"Well, let's see here. Marcus is trying to figure out if he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50-50 chance that a substitute teacher will be there tomorrow, and if that happens, he won't have to turn in his homework. 

If the regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. And even if she doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can talk his way out of it by saying his dog ate his homework.

So, let's break it down:
- 50% chance the sub is there, and he doesn't have to turn it in.
- 50% chance the regular teacher is there, and then:
  - 40% chance she gives an extension, so he doesn't have to turn it in.
  - 60% chance she doesn't give an extension, but then:
    - 20% chance he can talk his way out of it.

Now, let's add up the chances he doesn't have to turn it in:
- 50% (sub) + 50% * 40% (regular teacher gives extension) + 50% * 60% * 20% (regular teacher doesn't give extension but he talks his way out) = 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats left for families and friends.

Now, we need to split these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates. So, we divide 4750 by 950:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to the court case. So, the total time she spends is:
6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Next, she gets paid $15 per day for 3 days. So, her total earnings are:
$15/day * 3 days = $45

But, she also has to pay for parking, which costs her $3 per day for 3 days. So, her total expenses are:
$3/day * 3 days = $9

Now, to find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract the total expenses from her total earnings:
$45 - $9 = $36

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:
$36 / 18 hours = $2

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, I need to know how much the Parmesan cheese costs. It's $11 a pound, and Amor buys 2 pounds. So:

That's $22 for the Parmesan.

Next, the Mozzarella cheese costs $6 a pound, and Amor buys 3 pounds. So:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]
That's $18 for the Mozzarella.

Now, I add the cost of both types of cheese:
\[ 22 + 18 = 40 \]
So, the total cost of the cheese is $40.

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much she has left, I subtract the total cost of the cheese from the $50:
\[ 50 - 40 = 10 \]

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Jim went to college for 4 years. While he was in college, he got $50,000 in loans each year. So, the total loans he got are:
\[ 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \]

Before college, Jim had a job that paid him $25,000 a year. He didn't work for 4 years while he was in college, so the money he lost is:
\[ 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \]

So, the total amount of money Jim needs to make up is:
\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

After college, Jim's income tripled. So, his new job pays him:
\[ 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \] per year.

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new job, we divide the total amount by his new yearly income:
\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money he lost while in school.

"Well, let's see. Jim's bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the fabric needs to be 8 feet long (6 + 2) and 10 feet wide (8 + 2).

To find out how much fabric he needs for one piece, we multiply the length by the width:
8 feet times 10 feet equals 80 square feet.

Since he needs two pieces, we multiply 80 square feet by 2:
80 square feet times 2 equals 160 square feet.

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way:

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. That's a lot of letters!

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of what they delivered on Monday. So, one-fifth of 425 is 85. Then, 17 more than 85 is 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice what they delivered on Tuesday. Twice 102 is 204. Then, 5 more than 204 is 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up all the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
- Monday: 425

"Well, let's see here. Johnny's dad had a bit of a mixed day at the races.

1. In the first race, he lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice what he lost in the first race. So, twice $5 is $10, and $1 more than that is $11.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times what he won in the second race. So, 1.5 times $11 is $16.5.

Now, let's add up the losses:
- First race: $5

Total loss: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Total races: 3

"Well, let's see. There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. So, that's 26 times 5, which gives us 130 cities. Now, if each city has 1000 people, then we just need to multiply 130 by 1000. That's 130,000 people in total.

130000"
"Well, let's see. Xavier was 4 feet tall, and he grew 3 inches. So, 4 feet is 48 inches, and 48 inches plus 3 inches is 51 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so that's 52 inches. Now, to find out how much taller Cole is than Xavier, we just subtract: 52 inches minus 51 inches. That's 1 inch.

1 inch"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

We have three people sharing $1920. Let's call the amount the first person gets ""x.""

The second person gets $80 more than the first person, so that's ""x + 80.""

The third person gets twice what the second person gets, so that's ""2 * (x + 80).""

Now, we add all these amounts together, and they should equal $1920:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Let's simplify this:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Now, we need to solve for x. First, subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person gets $420.

\(\boxed{420}\)"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

So, there are 4 painters working on a big house. They worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days. That means they worked for 21 days in total.

Now, they didn't work a full day each day. They only worked 3/8 of a day. A full day has 24 hours, so 3/8 of a day is:

\[ \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, each day, the team worked 9 hours.

Over 21 days, the total hours worked by the team is:

\[ 21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked:

\[ \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

47.25"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out on my own.

Rory picked up 19 tennis balls in total. We need to figure out how many he picked up in each set.

1. In the first set, he picked up 4 more balls than in the second set.
2. In the third set, he picked up half as many balls as in the second set.

Let's say he picked up \( x \) balls in the second set. Then:
- In the first set, he picked up \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he picked up \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

Now, we add them all up:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To make it easier, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying everything by 2:
\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 5x = 38 - 8 \]
\[ 5x = 30 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, he picked up 6 balls. Now we can find out how many he picked up in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory picked up 10 balls in the first set.

"Well, let's see. Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007, and it goes down in value by 21% each year. We need to figure out what it's worth in 2010, which is 3 years later.

First, we take the 21% and turn it into a decimal, which is 0.21. Then, we subtract that from 1 to find out what part of the car's value stays the same each year. So, 1 - 0.21 = 0.79. This means the car keeps 79% of its value each year.

Now, we need to do this three times, one for each year. So, we multiply the original price by 0.79 three times:

$20,000 * 0.79 * 0.79 * 0.79

Let's do the math:

$20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800
$15,800 * 0.79 = $12,482
$12,482 * 0.79 = $9,860.78

So, in 2010, the car is worth about $9,860.78.

9860.78"
"Well, let's see. There are 50 books in the library. Half of them, which is 25, are in English. Then, 10% of 50 books are in German, so that's 5 books. If we take away the English and German books from the total, we get:

50 - 25 - 5 = 20

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

20"
"Well, let's see. If Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, that's 325 times 4, which is 1300 kilometers. The whole trip is about 1955 kilometers. So, to find out how much more she has to drive, we take 1955 and subtract 1300. That leaves us with 655 kilometers. So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

655"
"Well, let's see. Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. If there are 16 cups in a gallon, we need to figure out how many gallons that is in 30 days.

First, we find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days:
8 cups a day times 30 days is 240 cups.

Now, to find out how many gallons that is, we divide the total cups by the number of cups in a gallon:
240 cups divided by 16 cups per gallon is 15 gallons.

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. Romeo gets on the train, and there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people get on. So now there are:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off, and twice that number (which is 100 people) get on. So now there are:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \text{ people}
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off. So now there are:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110 \text{ people}
   \]

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
110

"Well, let's see. Alison bought a tank top for $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so that's $15. The tennis shoes were on sale for half of $48, which is $24. She also got some socks for $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost her $6.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Socks: $6

So, $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.

"Well, let's see. If my kitchen floor is 200 square feet and each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, that means each tile covers 1 square foot. So, I need 200 tiles to cover the whole floor. If each tile costs $12, then I just need to multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile. 

200 tiles times $12 per tile equals $2400.

So, it will cost me $2400 to renovate my kitchen floor.

2400"
"Well, let's see. James had an accident, and now his insurance costs 60% more than the normal $120 a month. 

First, we need to figure out what 60% of $120 is. That's like saying 60 out of 100 parts of $120. So, we do:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Now, we add that extra $72 to the normal $120 to get the new monthly cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for insurance.

"Well, let's see. Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. His laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.

For the twin beds:
- He needs to wash 4 twin sets.
- The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time.
- So, he needs to do 2 loads for the twin sheets.

For the king bed:
- He needs to wash 1 king set.
- The machine can wash 1 king set at a time.
- So, he needs to do 1 load for the king sheet.

In total, every week he does:
- 2 loads for the twin sheets + 1 load for the king sheet = 3 loads per week.

Now, there are 52 weeks in a year. So, in a year, he does:
- 3 loads per week ร 52 weeks = 156 loads.

So, the answer is:

"Well, let's see. On Saturdays, Jill and her friends watch 4 movies. On Sundays, they watch half as many, so that's 2 movies. So, in one weekend, they watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, which adds up to 6 movies.

Now, if they do this every weekend for 4 weeks, we just need to multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4. So, 6 movies times 4 weeks is 24 movies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting cookies.

1. **Total Pizzas and Slices:**
   - They had 4 pizzas.
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - So, 4 pizzas times 8 slices each equals 32 slices total.

2. **What Each Person Ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 times 7 = 14 slices.

3. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Add them up: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out in my head.

Betsy and Donovan made a meal together, and it took them 98 minutes in total. Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan. So, if we figure out how long Donovan took, we can add 18 minutes to that to find out how long Betsy took.

Let's say Donovan took \( D \) minutes. Betsy took \( D + 18 \) minutes. Together, they took 98 minutes, so:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Now, let's add \( D \) and \( D + 18 \):

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to get \( D \) by itself. We can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy took 18 minutes longer, so:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"Well, let's see. The doctor's visit costs a bunch of different things, so we gotta add 'em all up.

1. The cast costs $200.
2. The visit is 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The doc charges $300 an hour, so half an hour would be $150.
3. The painkillers cost $4 each, and she gets 30 of 'em. So that's 30 times $4, which is $120.
4. The parking is $6 an hour, and she has to stay for at least 2 hours. So that's 2 times $6, which is $12.

Now, we add all that up:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:

"Well, let's see. John got 100 on his first three tests, and then he got 80 on his fourth test. To find out his average, we add up all his scores and then divide by how many tests there were.

So, 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380. That's the total of all his scores.

Now, we divide 380 by 4, because there are 4 tests. 

380 divided by 4 is 95.

"Well, let's see. The glee club got 20 pizzas and they ate 70% of them. So, they ate 14 pizzas, which means they left 6 pizzas. 

Now, the football team got twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so that's 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 32 pizzas. So, they left 8 pizzas.

If we add the pizzas left by both groups, that's 6 pizzas from the glee club and 8 pizzas from the football team. So, in total, there are 14 pizzas left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons, so that's:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Now, each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, for 700 small coupons, the cost is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. So, for 1400 big coupons, the cost is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost, we add the costs of the small and big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Anthony spends a total of:
\[ 245 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches. So, Sidney had:
7 - 4 = 3 sandwiches left

Sidney then ordered another 3 sandwiches, so now Sidney has:
3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches

Each sandwich has 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 6 sandwiches is:
6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

So, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

Now, if each of those 15 trucks had 20 tons of fertiliser, we just need to figure out how much fertiliser 15 trucks can carry. 

15 trucks times 20 tons each is 300 tons.

So, the farmers got 300 tons of fertiliser that day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The store has a deal: buy one pound of butter, get the next one at half price. The butter costs $4.00 a pound.

So, for every 2 pounds of butter:
- The first pound costs $4.00.
- The second pound costs $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 6 pounds:
- First pound: $4.00
- Second pound: $2.00
- Third pound: $4.00
- Fourth pound: $2.00
- Fifth pound: $4.00
- Sixth pound: $2.00

Add it all up:
$4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

So, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to buy 6 pounds of butter.

"Well, let's see. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's 25 + 7 + 13, which is 45 people. But 4 people can't come, so that leaves 41 people.

The theater costs $125 for the first 20 people. For the extra people, it's $6 each. So, 41 - 20 is 21 extra people. 

21 extra people at $6 each is 21 times 6, which is 126 dollars.

So, the total cost is 125 dollars for the first 20 people plus 126 dollars for the extra people. That's 125 + 126, which is 251 dollars.

"Well, let's see. Mr. Robles has 315 bananas, and that's enough for his three monkeys for a whole week. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas every day. So, in a week, that's 10 bananas times 7 days, which is 70 bananas.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first one each day. So, the second monkey eats 14 bananas a day. In a week, that's 14 bananas times 7 days, which is 98 bananas.

Now, the first and second monkeys together eat 70 bananas plus 98 bananas, which is 168 bananas in a week.

So, the third monkey must eat the rest of the bananas. If Mr. Robles has 315 bananas and the first two monkeys eat 168 bananas, then the third monkey eats 315 minus 168, which is 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide 147 bananas by 7 days. That's 147 divided by 7, which is 21 bananas each day.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"Well, let's see. Jenny goes to the florist and buys 15 roses. Now, a dozen roses cost $15, and that's 12 roses. So, for 12 roses, she pays $15. She needs 3 more roses, and each rose costs $2, so 3 roses cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars. 

So, the total cost for 15 roses is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars. Jenny has five 5-dollar bills, which means she has \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars. 

Now, if she pays 21 dollars and has 25 dollars, she gets \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars back. Since the florist only has quarters, and 1 dollar is 4 quarters, 4 dollars is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) quarters.

So, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

6 milkshakes times $5.50 each is $33.00.

Next, the burger platters:
9 burger platters times $11 each is $99.00.

Then, the sodas:
20 sodas times $1.50 each is $30.00.

2. The second train comes 30 minutes after the first one leaves. So, it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after I start waitin'. It stays for 5 minutes, so it leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after I start waitin'.
3. The third train comes an hour after the second one leaves. So, it arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after I start waitin'. It leaves right away, so it's gone at 125 minutes.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

1. The watch originally costs $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought it for 75% of the original price. So, he paid:

4. The friend paid $1800 for a watch that originally cost $2000. The discount the friend got is:
   \[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]
5. To find the percentage discount, we use:

"Well, let's see. If one spring makes one jellyfish every second, and there are 5 springs, that means 5 jellyfish are made every second. Now, we need to figure out how many seconds are in 4 hours. 

An hour has 60 minutes, and a minute has 60 seconds, so:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- So, 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds
- 4 hours = 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds

If 5 jellyfish are made every second, and there are 14400 seconds in 4 hours, then:
- 5 jellyfish/second * 14400 seconds = 72000 jellyfish

So, 5 springs would make 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

So, he walks 2 miles to the halfway point, 2 miles back home, and then 4 miles to the store. That's 2 + 2 + 4, which is 8 miles in total.

James walks at 4 miles per hour. To figure out how long it takes him to walk 8 miles, we divide the total distance by his speed:

8 miles รท 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how many bananas Jenny got. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has about 4 bananas. So, 10 bunches times 4 bananas per bunch equals 40 bananas.

Now, if she bought these bananas one by one, each banana costs 80 cents. So, 40 bananas times 80 cents each equals 32 dollars.

But Jenny bought the bananas in bunches, and each bunch costs 3 dollars. So, 10 bunches times 3 dollars each equals 30 dollars.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually. So, 32 dollars minus 30 dollars equals 2 dollars.

Jenny saved 2 dollars by buying the bananas in bunches.

"Well, let's see. If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can figure this out.

First, we need to split the 100 feet so that Harry gets 60 feet more. If we take away the extra 60 feet that Harry gets, we have 40 feet left to split evenly between Sam and Harry. So, 40 feet divided by 2 is 20 feet.

That means Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.

"Well, let's see. If a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, that means it grows 2 inches every year. So, in 13 years, it would grow 2 inches times 13 years, which is 26 inches.

"Well, let's see. Marcel sells three kinds of bikes: MTBs, BMXs, and Trekking bikes. The MTBs cost $500 each, the BMXs are half that, so $250 each, and the Trekking bikes are $450 each.

He sold 300 bikes in total. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so that's 150 Trekking bikes. Fifteen percent were BMX bikes, so that's 45 BMX bikes. The rest were MTBs, so that's 105 MTBs.

Now, let's figure out how much he made from each type:
- From the Trekking bikes: 150 bikes at $450 each, that's 150 times 450, which is $67,500.
- From the BMX bikes: 45 bikes at $250 each, that's 45 times 250, which is $11,250.
- From the MTBs: 105 bikes at $500 each, that's 105 times 500, which is $52,500.

Now, add all that up:
- $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

So, Marcel made $131,250 from selling bikes that month.

"Well, let's see. The farmer makes 5 bales every hour, and the truck takes away 3 bales every hour. So, every hour, the farmer ends up with 2 more bales in the field. If they work for 6 hours, that means the farmer will have 2 bales times 6 hours, which is 12 bales left in the field at the end of the day.

12"
"Well, let's see. John has 6 regular classes a day, but he has 2 extra ones, so that's 8 classes a day. He goes to school 5 days a week, so:

8 classes a day times 5 days a week is 40 classes a week.

Each class is 40 minutes long, so:

40 classes times 40 minutes is 1600 minutes a week for his regular classes.

Now, he spends 1/16 of that time on Saturdays and Sundays. So, 1600 minutes divided by 16 is 100 minutes. He does this on both Saturday and Sunday, so:

100 minutes times 2 days is 200 minutes more.

Adding the extra time to his regular time:

1600 minutes plus 200 minutes is 1800 minutes a week.

To find out how many hours that is, we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour:

1800 minutes divided by 60 is 30 hours.

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"Well, let's see. If the ball bounces to two-thirds of the height it was dropped from, and it starts from the third floor, which is 72 feet high, we can figure this out step by step.

First, after the first bounce, it goes up to two-thirds of 72 feet. That's:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Then, after the second bounce, it goes up to two-thirds of 48 feet. That's:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, on the second bounce, the ball goes up to 32 feet.

32"
"Well, let's see. The first kid is 6 feet tall. That's 72 inches, 'cause there's 12 inches in a foot. The second kid is 2 inches taller, so that's 74 inches. The third kid is 5 inches shorter than the second, so that's 69 inches. The fourth kid is 3 inches taller than the third, so that's 72 inches.

72"
"Well, let's see. If the orchard sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples, that means they sold 200 bags. If each bag is sold for $5, then the orchard made 200 times 5, which is 1000 dollars.

1000"
"Well, let's see. The big T-Rex ate half of the little triceratops, so there was half left. Then, the pack of velociraptors came and ate half of what was left, so there was only a quarter left. The lazy Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means that 270 kilograms was a quarter of the triceratops. 

If 270 kilograms is a quarter, then the whole triceratops must have been 4 times that much. So, 270 times 4 is 1080 kilograms.

1080"
"Well, let's see. I need to figure out how much it'll cost to paint this room. First, I gotta know how much area I need to paint.

The north and south walls are 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, each of those walls is 10 times 8, which is 80 square feet. There are two of these walls, so that's 80 times 2, which is 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, each of those walls is 5 times 8, which is 40 square feet. There are two of these walls, so that's 40 times 2, which is 80 square feet.

Now, I add the areas of all the walls together: 160 square feet plus 80 square feet, which gives me 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. So, I need to figure out how many gallons I need. I divide the total area by the coverage per gallon: 240 square feet divided by 20 square feet per gallon, which is 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12. So, I multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon: 12 gallons times $12, which is $144.

So, it'll cost me $144 to paint the room.

144"
"Okay, let's think about this like a simple problem.

Ellen had a case of 12 sodas. She shook up 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself. So now there are 11 sodas left, with 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.

Her brother came and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So now there are 8 sodas left, with 2 shaken and 6 unshaken.

Now, Ellen's friend is going to pick a soda. We need to figure out the chance that the friend picks a shaken soda.

There are 8 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken. So the chance is 2 out of 8.

To make it a percentage, we do this:
2 divided by 8 equals 0.25. Then we multiply 0.25 by 100 to get the percentage.

So, the chance is 25%.

25%"
"Well, let's see. If one train is going 60 miles an hour and the other is going half that, which is 30 miles an hour, and they both travel for 3 hours, we can figure out how far apart they are.

The first train, going 60 miles an hour, would travel:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The second train, going 30 miles an hour, would travel:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Now, since they're going in opposite directions, you just add those distances together:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, after 3 hours, they are 270 miles apart.

270"
"Alright, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we need to know how many days there are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, we add those up:

31 days (March) + 19 days (April) = 50 days

Next, Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days that is, we do:

20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

So, Billy takes 10 days off. That means he works the rest of the days:

50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Now, Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day. So, each day he helps:

2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Finally, to find out how many people he helps in total, we multiply the number of people he helps each day by the number of days he works:

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

So, Billy helps 240 people.

240"
"Well, let's see. There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. So, that's 12 times 35, which is 420 people. Then, there were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people. So, that's 20 times 3, which is 60 people. If you add those together, 420 plus 60, you get 480 people. So, there were 480 people inside the church.

480"
"Well, let's see. Mike is 24, and Martha is 4 years younger, so she's 20. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so he's 30.

"Well, let's see. The biggest slide is 300 feet long, and you go down at 60 feet every minute. So, to figure out how long it takes, you divide 300 by 60, which gives you 5 minutes.

Now, the second slide is 240 feet long, and you go down at 80 feet every minute. So, you divide 240 by 80, which gives you 3 minutes.

To find out how much longer the biggest slide takes, you just subtract the time for the second slide from the time for the biggest slide. So, 5 minutes minus 3 minutes equals 2 minutes.

"Well, let's see. Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. That's 30 minutes for lunch and 30 minutes for both breaks, which adds up to 1 hour each day.

If we do this for 5 days, it's 1 hour each day times 5 days. So, that's 5 hours total.

5"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times that. So, Micah ran 28 miles. Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28, which is 36 miles. Since they all ran 52 miles in total, Ahito must have run the rest. So, 52 - 36 is 16 miles. 

Ahito ran 16 miles.

16"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. Sheila charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we need to take that off the total.
   - $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00.
   - 20% of $20.00 is $4.00 (because 20% is the same as 0.20, and 0.20 times 20 is 4).
   - So, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.
   - 10% of $30.00 is $3.00 (because 10% is the same as 0.10, and 0.10 times 30 is 3).
   - So, the set of towels costs $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Now, we add the costs of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance.
   - $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

113.00"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out step by step.

So, we have a tank with a bunch of jellyfish. Some of them are big, and some are small. The big ones can change color when a special light is on, and the small ones stay blue all the time.

1. We know that one-fifth of the jellyfish are big. That means if we have 5 jellyfish, 1 of them is big.
2. Out of the big jellyfish, one-third of them change color when the light is on. So, if we have 3 big jellyfish, 1 of them changes color.
3. We're told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the light was on. These must be the big jellyfish that can change color.

Now, let's figure out how many big jellyfish there are:
- If 6 jellyfish changed color, and that's one-third of the big jellyfish, then the total number of big jellyfish must be 6 times 3, which is 18.

Next, we need to find out how many jellyfish are in the tank in total:
- We know that the big jellyfish are one-fifth of the total number of jellyfish. So, if 18 big jellyfish are one-fifth of the total, then the total number of jellyfish must be 18 times 5, which is 90.

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

90"
"Well, let's see. If Chris is 4, and Ben is two times older than Chris, that means Ben is 8. Now, if Caroline is three times older than Ben, then Caroline must be 24.

"Well, let's see. Lauren wants to save up for 20 years of retirement, and she plans to live on 40% of her current salary. Her salary is $100,000, so 40% of that is $40,000 a year. For 20 years, that's $40,000 times 20, which is $800,000. 

Now, Lauren saves 20% of her salary each year. So, 20% of $100,000 is $20,000. To save up $800,000, she needs to save $20,000 each year. 

So, if we divide $800,000 by $20,000, we get 40. That means Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

40"
"Well, let's see. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, if we split 100 by 4, that's 25 centimeters for each part. Now, each of these 25 centimeter parts needs to be cut into 5 equal parts. So, we take 25 and split it by 5, which gives us 5 centimeters. So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

5"
"Well, let's see. If 40% of the school is boys and there are 240 boys, that means 240 is 40% of the total number of students. To find the total number of students, you can think of it like this: if 240 is 40%, then 100% (the whole school) would be 240 divided by 40, and then multiplied by 100. 

So, 240 divided by 40 is 6, and 6 times 100 is 600. That means there are 600 students in total.

Now, if there are 600 students in total and 240 of them are boys, then the rest must be girls. So, 600 minus 240 is 360.

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

360"
"Well, let's see. My mom bought some pots for $19 and a big bag of soil for $26. She had a coupon that took $7 off the total. So, we add the pots and the soil: $19 plus $26 is $45. Then we take away the $7 from the coupon. That leaves us with $38.

"Well, let's see. We got three ladies wearin' 4-inch heels, and three more wearin' 2-inch heels. 

First, we add up all the inches:
- Three 4-inch heels: 3 times 4 is 12 inches.
- Three 2-inch heels: 3 times 2 is 6 inches.

Now, we add those together:
12 inches plus 6 inches is 18 inches.

Next, we divide by the number of ladies, which is 6:
18 inches divided by 6 is 3 inches.

So, the average height of the heels is 3 inches.

"Well, let's see. Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, and June has 30 days. She's thinking of walking 125 miles twice a day, which is 250 miles a day. 

First, let's figure out how many miles she'll hike in a month if she sticks to her plan:
250 miles a day for 30 days is 250 times 30, which is 7,500 miles.

Now, she wants to hike 9,300 miles, so she needs to hike 9,300 minus 7,500 more miles. That's 1,800 miles more.

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide 1,800 by 30:
1,800 divided by 30 is 60 miles.

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles each day to reach her goal.

60"
"Well, let's see. I ain't the best at numbers, but I can try to figure this out.

We got 3 red balls, and each one costs $9. So, 3 times 9 is 27. That's the money from the red balls.

Then, there's 11 blue balls, and each one costs $5. So, 11 times 5 is 55. That's the money from the blue balls.

Lastly, we got 25 green balls, and each one costs $3. So, 25 times 3 is 75. That's the money from the green balls.

Now, we add all that up: 27 plus 55 plus 75. That's 157.

So, the store will have 157 dollars after all the balls are sold.

157"
"Well, let's see. Pierre, Paul, and Jacques got 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of that, so he gets 3 kg. Paul wants a third, so he gets 4 kg. 

Now, if Pierre takes 3 kg and Paul takes 4 kg, that's 7 kg in total. So, Jacques will have the rest, which is 12 kg minus 7 kg. 

So, Jacques will have 5 kg left.

3. He spent $5 on a comic book, so he has $32 - $5 = $27 left.
4. He then spent $19 on a puzzle, so he has $27 - $19 = $8 left.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

"Well, let's see. Tate's got a pond with some fish. He starts with 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies, and 3 male goldfish and 5 female goldfish. Then he buys more fish: 2 more male guppies, 1 more female guppy, 2 more male goldfish, and 3 more female goldfish.

So, let's count 'em up:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's add the males and females together:
- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

To find out how many more female fish there are than male fish:
- 16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're just talking it through.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - So, Megan took 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - So, Dior took 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up all the time they spent:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

So, the total time they all took to do their chores is 18 hours.

"Well, let's see. John goes to see his folks twice a month. It takes him 2 hours to get there, and he drives at 70 miles an hour. 

First, we figure out how far he goes in one trip:
- If he drives for 2 hours at 70 miles an hour, that's 2 times 70, which is 140 miles.

Now, that's just one way. He has to come back, so for a round trip, it's:
- 140 miles there and 140 miles back, which is 280 miles.

Since he does this twice a month, we need to double that:
- 280 miles for one visit, and he visits twice, so 280 times 2 is 560 miles.

So, John drives 560 miles a month when he goes to see his parents.

560"

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

So, we got 400 toys to make. We got 5 workers, and they all work for 10 hours. Two of them can make 6 toys every hour, and two others can make 4 toys every hour. By the end, they still need 20 more toys to finish the order.

First, let's see how many toys the first two workers make:
- Each makes 6 toys an hour, so together they make 12 toys an hour.
- Over 10 hours, they make 120 toys.

Next, the other two workers:
- Each makes 4 toys an hour, so together they make 8 toys an hour.
- Over 10 hours, they make 80 toys.

So, the four workers together make:
- 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

Now, they need 400 toys in total, and they still need 20 more toys at the end of the day. So, they must have made:
- 400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys.

Since the four workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must have made:
- 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys.

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so they must have made:
- 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

So, the fifth worker makes 18 toys per hour.

Elijah also has another dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, we need to find half of 60 pounds:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the dogs:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds (Kory's dog)} + 15 \text{ pounds (Elijah's first dog)} + 30 \text{ pounds (Elijah's second dog)} = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

3. So, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers in total.
4. Kris got all his stickers from Luis.
5. Luis gave half of the stickers he got from Seth to Kris.
6. So, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 Easter eggs in total. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.

First, let's figure out how many eggs Sarah painted. If Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can set it up like this:

- Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs.
- Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
- Together, they painted \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).

So, \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

- \( 2S + 12 = 30 \)
- \( 2S = 30 - 12 \)
- \( 2S = 18 \)
- \( S = 9 \)

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Now, we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together, so Arnold and Madeline must have painted the rest:

- Total eggs painted by all four: 56
- Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah: 30
- Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline: \( 56 - 30 = 26 \)

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted:

- \( 26 \div 2 = 13 \) eggs each.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Difference: \( 21 - 13 = 8 \)

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out myself.

First, Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them in groups of 8. So, I need to figure out how many groups of 8 crayons he can make. 

200 crayons รท 8 crayons per group = 25 groups

So, he can make 25 groups. Each group goes into one box, so he needs 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes ร 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons ร 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, I need to add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

There are 16 ounces in a pound, so I need to convert 400 ounces to pounds:

400 ounces รท 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"Well, let's see. John cuts down a big tree, 80 feet tall. But he can only use 80% of it, so that's 64 feet of tree he can work with. He cuts it into 4-foot logs. So, 64 feet divided by 4 feet per log gives us 16 logs.

From each log, he gets 5 planks. So, 16 logs times 5 planks per log gives us 80 planks. He sells each plank for $1.2. So, 80 planks times $1.2 per plank equals $96.

So, John makes $96.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Valerie earns $5000 a month. Her brother earns twice as much as her, so he earns:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, let's add Valerie's and her brother's earnings together:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mom earns twice what both of them make together, so:
\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Finally, to find out how much they all have together, we add up all their earnings:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:
45000"
"Well, let's see. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes. So, she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach. On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast, so she walks 1 mile in 10 minutes. 

Now, add the time she spends on the beach and the sidewalk:
- Beach: 40 minutes
- Sidewalk: 10 minutes

So, the total time is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Well, let's see. Jane has been putting away 4 dollars every week for 8 weeks. So, she's got 4 times 8, which is 32 dollars. She wants to have 60 dollars in total. So, she needs 60 minus 32, which is 28 more dollars. Since she saves 4 dollars each week, she needs 28 divided by 4, which is 7 more weeks.

"Well, let's see. I got 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so that's 21 birds. Then, there's 2 more trees with 4 blue birds each, which gives us 8 more birds. Lastly, there's 1 tree with 3 blue birds. So, if we add all them up:

21 + 8 + 3 = 32

So, there are 32 blue birds in total."
"Well, let's see. If Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he'll have 60. Two dozen is 24, so he must have 36 marbles right now. If he loses 10, then he'll have 26 marbles left.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about mixing hot and cold water.

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other mug is at an unknown temperature. He mixes 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug with 1 ounce from the other mug, and the water is now drinkable.

To figure out the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to think about how mixing water works. When you mix water, the final temperature is somewhere between the temperatures of the two waters you're mixing. The more water you have of one temperature, the closer the final temperature will be to that temperature.

So, if 4 ounces of 33-degree water is mixed with 1 ounce of the unknown temperature water, and the final temperature is at least 40 degrees, we can set up a simple equation to find the unknown temperature.

Let's call the unknown temperature \( T \).

The final temperature \( T_f \) is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Now, let's solve for \( T \):
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"Well, let's see. Melanie's dad started with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Now, every day, he gets 20 more cows and 10 more chickens. This goes on for three weeks, which is 21 days.

So, for the cows:
- He starts with 50 cows.
- He gets 20 cows each day for 21 days, which is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.
- So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

For the chickens:
- He starts with 20 chickens.
- He gets 10 chickens each day for 21 days, which is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.
- So, the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Now, to find the total number of animals:
- 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.

"Well, let's see. If Russell buys 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10, that's $40 total. But he gets a 10% discount, so that's $4 off. So, he pays $36 for all the bagels.

"Well, let's see. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, that's 23 minus 5, which is 18 scoops.

Now, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. That means 6 minus 3 is 3 potatoes, and 3 minus 1 is 2 scoops.

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops. We need to find out how many potatoes make 18 scoops. If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then for 18 scoops, we need to figure out how many times 2 goes into 18, which is 9 times. So, we need 3 potatoes times 9, which is 27 potatoes.

Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"Well, let's see. Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, that's 3 times 30, which is 90 eggs. Then he eats 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, that's 5 times 30, which is 150 eggs. So, in 60 days, he eats 90 plus 150 eggs, which is 240 eggs. Now, a dozen eggs is 12, so we need to figure out how many dozens are in 240 eggs. We do that by dividing 240 by 12, which gives us 20. So, Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out on my own.

First, we know that the bus has 84 people in total. The ratio of men to women is 5 to 9. This means for every 14 people (5 men + 9 women), there are 5 men and 9 women.

To find out how many groups of 14 people there are on the bus, we divide 84 by 14:
\[ 84 \div 14 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 groups of 14 people on the bus. Now, we can find out how many men and women there are:
- Men: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Women: \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

Next, 20 women get off the bus. So, we subtract 20 from the number of women:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

"Well, let's see. Faraday sells sunflowers and bouquets. Each sunflower costs $2, and each bouquet costs $8. He makes $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets each day. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers in it.

First, let's figure out how many sunflowers he sells on their own each day:
- He makes $26 from sunflowers, and each one costs $2.
- So, he sells \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) sunflowers on their own each day.

Next, let's figure out how many bouquets he sells each day:
- He makes $56 from bouquets, and each one costs $8.
- So, he sells \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \) bouquets each day.

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers are in those bouquets:
- Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.
- So, in 7 bouquets, there are \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \) sunflowers.

So, each day, he sells:
- 13 sunflowers on their own
- 84 sunflowers in bouquets
- Total sunflowers each day = \( 13 + 84 = 97 \)

Now, we need to find out how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days:
- Total sunflowers in 3 days = \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \)

So, Faraday sells 291 sunflowers in 3 days.

291"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way:

Adam has $100. He buys rocks for $5 each. So, he can buy:
\[ 100 \div 5 = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

He sells 60% of his rocks. So, he sells:
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

He sells each rock for $7, so he makes:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

He spent $100 to buy the rocks, so his loss is:
\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Adam loses $16.

"Well, let's see. Lauren can draw 5 big pictures, 6 medium pictures, or 7 small pictures each day. She needs to draw 45 big ones, 36 medium ones, and 49 small ones. 

For the big pictures:
- She needs 45 big pictures and can do 5 a day, so that's 45 divided by 5, which is 9 days.

For the medium pictures:
- She needs 36 medium pictures and can do 6 a day, so that's 36 divided by 6, which is 6 days.

For the small pictures:
- She needs 49 small pictures and can do 7 a day, so that's 49 divided by 7, which is 7 days.

Now, we add all those days up:
- 9 days for the big ones, 6 days for the medium ones, and 7 days for the small ones. That's 9 + 6 + 7, which is 22 days.

So, it will take her 22 days to finish all the pictures.

Now, to find the chance that both tickets win, you multiply their chances together. So, 20% times 60% is like saying 0.20 times 0.60, which gives you 0.12. To turn that back into a percentage, you move the decimal point two places to the right, so it's 12%.

So, the chance that both tickets win is 12%.

Now, if he sells each for $40, and he has 6, he makes 6 times $40, which is $240.

But he spent $20 on each one, and he bought 6, so he spent 6 times $20, which is $120.

To find out how much extra money he made, we take what he made selling 'em and subtract what he spent. So, $240 minus $120 is $120.

So, Linus made $120 extra after selling all the mobile things.

2. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
3. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

So, Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Hortex makes 4200 bottles of carrot juice every day. Each bottle helps with 20% of what a person needs for energy in a day. So, to cover 100% of what one person needs, they would need 5 bottles (because 100% divided by 20% is 5).

Now, if we want to cover 100% of the energy needs for 2300 people, we need to figure out how many bottles that would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex already makes 4200 bottles a day. So, to find out how many more bottles they need to make, we subtract the number they already make from the total number needed:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex needs to make 7300 more bottles to cover the energy needs of 2300 people.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

1. Carla has 8 babies, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple. So, 3/4 of 8 is 6. That means 6 babies are in purple.
2. The rest, 1/4 of 8, are dressed in blue. So, 1/4 of 8 is 2. That means 2 babies are in blue.
3. All the blue babies wear bows, so 2 babies in blue wear bows.
4. 1/3 of the purple babies also wear bows. So, 1/3 of 6 is 2. That means 2 babies in purple wear bows.
5. Now, we need to find out how many babies are wearing bows in total. We have 2 in blue and 2 in purple, so 2 + 2 = 4 babies wearing bows.
6. We want to know the chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are in purple.
7. So, the chance is 2 out of 4, which is 1/2 or 50%.

The final answer is:

"Well, let's see. The IRS got 5168 tax reports last week. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports. To find out how many they got on Wednesday, we need to do some simple math.

First, we add up the reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, we subtract that number from the total reports they got last week:

2 masks ร 3 times = 6 masks a day.

Now, if we want to know how many masks he uses in 2 days, we just multiply the number of masks he uses in one day by 2:
6 masks/day ร 2 days = 12 masks.

So, Tyrion uses 12 masks every 2 days.

"Well, let's see. John collects garbage from three places. The first two places got 200 apartments each, so that's 400 apartments. The third place is 60% bigger than the first two combined, so it's 60% of 400, which is 240 more apartments. So, the third place has 640 apartments.

Now, adding all the apartments together:
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so he does:
1040 apartments * 3 times a week = 3120 collections a week.

He gets paid 40 cents for each collection, so:
3120 collections * 0.40 dollars = 1248 dollars a week.

So, John makes 1248 dollars a week.

"Well, let's see. I heard that a 5-year-old avocado tree gives about 50 fruits. When it's 6 years old, it gives 3 times that, so that's 150 fruits. At 7 years, it gives 7 times the 50, which is 350 fruits. Now, at 8 years, it gives 200 less than what it gives at 10 years. The 10-year-old tree gives 20 times the 50, so that's 1000 fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree gives 1000 minus 200, which is 800 fruits. But at 9 years, it doesn't give any fruits at all. 

So, if we add all that up:
- 5 years: 50 fruits
- 6 years: 150 fruits
- 7 years: 350 fruits
- 8 years: 800 fruits
- 9 years: 0 fruits
- 10 years: 1000 fruits

That's 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

We have three ropes: a red one, a blue one, and a yellow one. The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. And all three ropes together add up to 37 centimeters.

First, let's call the length of the blue rope ""B"" centimeters. 

Since the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope, the red rope is 4B centimeters.

The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is B + 7 centimeters.

Now, we know that the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So we can write this as:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Let's simplify that:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Now, we need to solve for B. First, subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long. 

Now, the red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \]

This means Rissa gave away $15 - $12 = $3.

Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie also gave away $3.

So, Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3. That means Ronnie has:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, Ronnie has $2 left.

So, each of the red, white, and purple colors uses 2 pints of paint.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:

"Well, let's see. Tom's got 4 bedrooms, and each one is 20 by 12 feet. So, each bedroom is 240 square feet. Four of 'em would be 4 times 240, which is 960 square feet.

Now, the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, that's 5 times 240, which is 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

So, to find the total area, we add 'em all up: 960 for the bedrooms, 1200 for the living room, and 1000 for the rest. That's 960 + 1200 + 1000, which is 3160 square feet.

- The special box costs $12 and has 120 pods.
- So, for $1, you get \( \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ pods} \).

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way:

1. Thomas takes out $1000 in $20 bills. That means he gets 50 $20 bills because $1000 divided by $20 is 50.
2. He loses 10 of these $20 bills. So, he has 40 $20 bills left.
3. He uses half of the 40 $20 bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 $20 bills. Now he has 20 $20 bills left.
4. He triples the money he has left. So, he has 20 $20 bills, which is $400. Tripling $400 gives him $1200.
5. He then converts all his money into $5 bills. $1200 divided by $5 is 240.

So, Thomas ends up with 240 $5 bills.

\[
\boxed{240}

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

In the first half:
- Team A scored 4 goals.
- Team B scored 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scored 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, Team B scored 4 times 2, which is 8 goals.
- Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals Team B scored in the second half. So, Team A scored 1/4 of 8, which is 2 goals.

Now, let's add up all the goals:
- Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total.
- Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out step by step.

On Monday, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses up 45% of it, which means he uses 2.25 inches (because 5 times 0.45 is 2.25). So, after Monday, he has 2.75 inches left (because 5 minus 2.25 is 2.75).

Now, each day after that, he uses 20% of the chalk he has left. That means he keeps 80% of the chalk each day.

Let's see how much chalk he has left each day:

- **Day 1 (Tuesday):** He starts with 2.75 inches. He uses 20%, so he keeps 80%. 
  - 2.75 times 0.80 is 2.20 inches.
- **Day 2 (Wednesday):** He starts with 2.20 inches. He uses 20%, so he keeps 80%.
  - 2.20 times 0.80 is 1.76 inches.

By Wednesday, he has 1.76 inches left, which is less than 2 inches. So, he has to recycle the chalk after 2 more days.

"Well, let's see. Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls, so that's 24 kids in total. Now, one-third of the girls are on varsity, so that's 4 girls. And one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so that's 3 boys. 

So, 4 girls and 3 boys are on varsity, which makes 7 kids on varsity. If there are 24 kids in total and 7 are on varsity, then the rest must not be on varsity. 

So, 24 minus 7 is 17. That means 17 kids are not on varsity.

17"
"Well, let's see. Mike got 5 face masks. Now, Johnny got 2 more than three times what Mike got. So, three times what Mike got is 15, 'cause 5 times 3 is 15. Then, Johnny got 2 more than that, so 15 plus 2 is 17. Johnny bought 17 face masks.

17"
"Well, let's see. James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them. Then, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so that's 4 plus 7, which is 11 teeth capped. So, the dentist fixes 4 drilled teeth and 11 capped teeth, which is 15 teeth in total.

To find out what percentage of his teeth the dentist fixes, we take the 15 teeth fixed and divide it by the total 30 teeth, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, 15 divided by 30 is 0.5, and 0.5 times 100 is 50.

The dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"Well, let's see. Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk, and each gallon cost him $3.5. So, the total cost was 4000 times 3.5, which is $14,000. Now, 2 out of every 5 gallons were no good and had to be returned. That means 2/5 of 4000 gallons, which is 1600 gallons, were bad. 

To find out how much he got back, we take the 1600 gallons and multiply it by the cost per gallon, which is $3.5. So, 1600 times 3.5 equals $5,600. That's the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds.

5600"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. So, if Colin is \( C \) years old now, in seven years he'll be \( C + 7 \) years old. Wendy is five times that age, so Wendy is \( 5(C + 7) \) years old.

In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old. The problem says that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, \( C + 25 \) is a third of Wendy's current age, which is \( 5(C + 7) \).

So, we can write:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7) \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, simplify the right side:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

2. Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]

3. Expand both sides:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

4. Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

5. Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

6. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is 20 years old now.

"Well, let's see. Bob has $27000 to spend on books for 3 schools. He can get 100 books for $500. So, first, we need to figure out how many books he can get with all his money.

If 100 books cost $500, then each book costs $5. Now, if Bob has $27000, we divide that by the cost of one book to see how many books he can buy:
\[ 27000 \div 5 = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, he wants to split these books equally among 3 schools. So, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[ 5400 \div 3 = 1800 \text{ books per school} \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books for each school.

"Well, let's see. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up both apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one back into the tree. That made 5 more apples fall out. So now, there are 6 apples on the ground. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put 5 in his pocket, and threw the last one at the tree again. This time, 6 more apples fell out. Newton picked up all 7 apples that were on the ground and went home.

So, let's count the apples he has:
- 1 apple from the first time
- 5 apples from the second time
- 6 apples from the last time

That's 1 + 5 + 6 = 12 apples.

Newton brought home 12 apples.

"Well, let's see. Ali ordered 850 kilos of coal, and each bag is 50 kilos. So, we need to figure out how many 50 kilo bags are in 850 kilos. 

850 divided by 50 is 17. So, he got 17 bags. Each bag costs 18 dollars, so we need to multiply 17 by 18 to find out the total cost.

17 times 18 is 306.

So, Ali's order costs 306 dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how many slices of cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza Kate's friends will eat in total.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza. So, we multiply:
6 friends ร 6 slices per friend = 36 slices of cheese pizza.

Each of Kate's 6 friends also eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. So, we multiply:
6 friends ร 4 slices per friend = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza.

Now, we need to figure out how many whole pizzas that is.

A cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed:
36 slices รท 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas.

A pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed:
24 slices รท 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. Adding them together:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

Kate needs to buy 6 pizzas.

"Well, let's see. Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 days, so that's 3 miles times 3 days, which is 9 miles. Then, on Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. That's 2 days, so that's 5 miles times 2 days, which is 10 miles. 

Now, if we add the miles from all the days together, we get 9 miles plus 10 miles, which is 19 miles.

"Well, let's see. Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 of them melt every 15 minutes. So, in one hour, 8 snowballs melt because there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour. That means he really only has 12 snowballs left after an hour.

To get 60 snowballs, we need to figure out how many hours it takes. If he gets 12 snowballs every hour, we divide 60 by 12 to find out how many hours it takes. 

60 divided by 12 is 5.

So, it will take him 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

So, Digimon had its 20th anniversary. That means it came out 20 years ago. 

Now, John is 28 years old right now. So, 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

The problem says that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. So if John was 8, Jim must have been half of that. 

8 divided by 2 is 4. So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.

To find out how old Jim is now, we add 20 years to his age back then: 4 + 20 = 24.

So, Jim is 24 years old now.

"Well, let's see. Doxa ate 1 piece of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so that's 2 pieces. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so that's 3 pieces. If we add all that up, 1 + 2 + 3, they ate 6 pieces of the apple.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and got a new pack of 50. So, they ended up with 50 - 38 = 12 more bandages than they started with.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They didn't get any new packs, so they lost 28 bandages.

On the third day, they used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. They also got two new packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. So, they ended up with 100 - 25 = 75 more bandages than they started with that day.

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

So, the total change over the three days is 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means they must have started with 78 - 59 = 19 bandages on the first day.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"Well, let's see. May's hair color costs $40. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so that's 2 inches cut off. The haircut costs $30 for each inch cut. So, for 2 inches, that's 2 times $30, which is $60. Now, we add the cost of the color and the haircut together: $40 plus $60. That makes $100 in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Jen works 7 and a half hours each day, and she does this for 6 days every week. So, let's see how many hours she works in a week:
7.5 hours/day ร 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Now, she gets paid $1.5 for each hour she works. So, for 45 hours, she would earn:
45 hours/week ร $1.5/hour = $67.5/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we need to find out how much she earns in a month:
$67.5/week ร 4 weeks = $270

But wait, there's more! Jen gets an extra $10 for not missing any days in April. So, we add that to her total:
$270 + $10 = $280

So, Jen will receive $280 in April.

"Well, lemme see now. Jason did a bunch of chores and got paid for 'em. He did his laundry once, that's 3 dollars. He cleaned his room once, that's 1.50 dollars. He took the trash out twice, that's 0.75 dollars each time, so that's 1.50 dollars. And he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, that's 0.50 dollars each time, so that's 3 dollars. 

Now, let's add all that up: 3 dollars for laundry, 1.50 for cleaning his room, 1.50 for the trash, and 3 dollars for the dishes. That's 3 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3, which is 9 dollars.

So, Jason earned 9 dollars.

The total number of people that came into the restaurant that day is 320."
"Well, let's see. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, that's 5 packs times 5 pens, which gives us 25 red pens.

Now, she bought twice as many black pens as red pens. So, if she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought 10 packs of black pens. Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so that's 10 packs times 5 pens, which gives us 50 black pens.

To find out how many pens Alain has in total, we add the red pens and the black pens together. So, 25 red pens plus 50 black pens equals 75 pens.

So, Alain has 75 pens.

"Well, let's see. John bought 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so each bottle of scotch costs $60. He also bought twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he bought 20 bottles of cognac. Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch, so that's $60 plus half of $60, which is $30. So, each bottle of cognac costs $90.

Now, if he bought 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each, that's 20 times $90, which is $1800. Adding the $600 he spent on scotch, he spent a total of $600 plus $1800, which is $2400.

"Well, let's see. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees. So, he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so that's 30 White Oak trees in total for the second day. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted a quarter more than the 40 he did on the first day. A quarter of 40 is 10, so he planted 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add it all up:
- White Oak trees: 20 on the first day + 30 on the second day = 50 White Oak trees.
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 on the first day + 50 on the second day = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees he planted is 50 White Oak trees + 90 Lodgepole Pine trees = 140 trees.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting fish in a tank.

First, we got 66 fish in the tank. One-third of them have red stripes. So, we need to find out how many that is:
- One-third of 66 is 22. So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find out how many fish are left:
- 66 fish total minus 22 fish with red stripes leaves us with 44 fish.

Next, we're told that 5 out of every 11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we need to figure out how many that is:
- 5 out of 11 of 44 fish is 20 fish. So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Finally, we add the fish with red stripes and the fish with blue stripes to get the total:
- 22 fish with red stripes + 20 fish with blue stripes = 42 fish.

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, and each palette had 4 colors. So, that's:
2 palettes ร 4 colors = 8 colors

3 sets ร 6 colors = 18 colors

Now, let's add those up to find out how many colors she had in total:
8 colors + 18 colors = 26 colors

Then, her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, we need to subtract those 4 colors:
26 colors - 4 colors = 22 colors

Finally, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is:
6 colors รท 2 = 3 colors

We need to subtract those 3 colors from the remaining total:
22 colors - 3 colors = 19 colors

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison. So, the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, he gets a loan of $100,000. Now, he uses 60% of that loan to pay off his debts. We need to find out what 60% of $100,000 is. That's like taking 60 cents for every dollar, but for 100,000 dollars.

\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, he uses $60,000 to pay off his debts. Now, we need to find out how much money he has left. We take the total loan and subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts.

So, 56 plus 46 plus 26 is 128 kilograms. That's a lot of fish!

Now, if one kilogram of tuna sells for 50 cents, we just need to multiply 128 by 50 cents to find out how much he'll earn.

"Well, let's see. Trinity bought the magazines for $72. She sells them for 11/8 of what she paid. So, we need to figure out what 11/8 of $72 is.

First, we find out what 1/8 of $72 is. If we divide $72 by 8, we get $9. So, 1/8 of $72 is $9.

Now, 11/8 means we take 11 times $9. So, 11 times $9 is $99.

Trinity sells the magazines for $99. To find out her profit, we subtract what she paid from what she sold them for. So, $99 minus $72 is $27.

"Well, let's see. Brian's got this dehumidifier to dry out his damp basement. He tried it on different settings to see how much water it could take out of the air.

On the low setting, it takes out 1 liter of water each day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so that's:
1 liter/day ร 3 days = 3 liters

Then, on the medium setting, it takes out twice as much as the low setting, so that's 2 liters each day. He ran it for 3 days, so that's:
2 liters/day ร 3 days = 6 liters

Finally, on the high setting, it takes out twice as much as the medium setting, so that's 4 liters each day. He ran it for 5 days, so that's:

Since John has two classes, that's 15 students in one class plus 15 students in the other class, which makes 30 students in total for John's school.

Now, if we add Ali's 120 students to John's 30 students, we get 150 students in total for both schools.

So, after 11 months, Stephen has paid $275. 

To find out how much he still owes, we subtract what he's already paid from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, in the twelfth month, Stephen will pay \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out. Jordan has 2 kids, and each kid needs 5 diaper changes a day. So, that's 10 diaper changes in total. Jordan's wife does half of them, which means she does 5 diaper changes. So, Jordan has to do the other half, which is also 5 diaper changes.

"Well, let's see. I ain't no math whiz, but I can try to figure this out.

First, we need to know how many jelly beans can fit in that jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches at the bottom and 15 inches tall. So, the total space in the jar is:
\[ 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Now, they say the jelly beans only fill up about 80% of that space. So, the space the jelly beans actually take up is:
\[ 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean takes up about 0.15 cubic inches. So, the number of jelly beans that can fit is:
\[ \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

Tim thinks about 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans he thinks are in the jar is:
\[ 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

But the real number of red jelly beans is 900. So, Tim's guess was off by:
\[ 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just a regular person trying to figure it out.

1. The bus starts with 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 more people get on. So now there are 20 + 40 = 60 people on the bus.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who got on at the first stop get on. That's 3/4 of 40, which is 30 more people. So now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.
4. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. So 90 people become 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus.
5. The bus can hold 200 people. So, to fill the bus, we need 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

"Well, let's see. Pauline goes to the museum 3 times every year, and it costs her $2 each time. So, for one year, she spends 3 times $2, which is $6.

Now, she does this for 5 years. So, 5 years times $6 a year, that's $30.

After 5 years, the price goes up by 150%. Now, 150% of $2 is $3, so the new price is $2 plus $3, which is $5 for each visit.

Pauline keeps going to the museum 3 times a year, but now it costs $5 each time. So, for one year, she spends 3 times $5, which is $15.

She does this for 3 more years. So, 3 years times $15 a year, that's $45.

Now, we add the money she spent before the price went up and after it went up. So, $30 plus $45, that's $75.

So, Pauline spent $75 on all her visits to the museum.

"Well, let's see. There are 10 students in each grade, and there are 4 grades. So, that's 40 students in total. Now, only 8 students can go into the escape room at a time. So, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 we can make from 40 students.

If we divide 40 by 8, we get 5. That means we have 5 groups. Each group gets 45 minutes to try and escape. So, if we multiply 5 groups by 45 minutes, we get 225 minutes.

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

225"
"Well, let's see. John made 4 wooden tables and each one costs $20. So, 4 times 20 is 80. Then, he made 2 roof frames, and each one costs $10. So, 2 times 10 is 20. Now, we add 80 and 20 together, which gives us 100. So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"Well, let's see. Ian has a board that's 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces, and one piece is 4 times longer than the other. 

If we call the shorter piece \( x \), then the longer piece is \( 4x \). The total length of the board is the sum of these two pieces, so:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

That means:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The longer piece is 32 feet.

"Well, let's see. If Aiden makes 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, and he wants to make 80 meatballs, he needs to figure out how many pounds of meat that is. 

So, 80 meatballs divided by 16 meatballs per pound equals 5 pounds of meat. 

Now, for every pound of meat, he uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. So for 5 pounds, he would need 5 times 2 tablespoons, which is 10 tablespoons.

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"Well, let's see. Luke's got five windows, and each one is 35 inches wide. So, if we add up the width of all the windows, that's 5 times 35, which is 175 inches. But Luke needs to buy fabric that's twice the total width of the windows. So, we need to double 175, which gives us 350 inches. 

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

350"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, for the first 16 minutes, it costs 25 cents per minute. So, I need to count 25 cents for each of those 16 minutes:
- 16 minutes ร 25 cents = 400 cents
- 400 cents is the same as 4 dollars.

Next, for the remaining 20 minutes, it costs 20 cents per minute. So, I need to count 20 cents for each of those 20 minutes:
- 20 minutes ร 20 cents = 400 cents
- 400 cents is the same as 4 dollars.

Now, I add the two amounts together:
- 4 dollars + 4 dollars = 8 dollars

So, a 36-minute call would cost 8 dollars.

"Well, let's see. On Monday, it rained 2 inches. Now, they say it's gonna rain 1 more inch than twice what it rained on Monday. So, if we double Monday's rain, that's 4 inches. Then we add 1 more inch to that. So, it's gonna rain 5 inches on Tuesday.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows how to count and do some simple math.

Carly is making treats for her art class. She's making both cupcakes and brownies. The class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. So, that means there are 10 treats in total.

Now, the tricky part is that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's break that down:

- If she makes \( c \) cupcakes, then she makes \( 3c - 2 \) brownies.

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Combine like terms:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

2. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 4c = 12 \]

3. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. If you get both, you get a 20% discount. 

To find the discount, we add the costs:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Now, 20% of 75 is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the discount is $15. Subtract that from the total:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, Karen wants nail art on all 10 of her fingers. Each nail art costs $3, so:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Now, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted price:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay:
\[ 90 \]

"Well, let's see. Susan has 3 magazines that give her 12 issues each year. So, that's 3 times 12, which is 36 issues. Then, she has another magazine that gives her 6 issues a year. So, that's just 6 more. Lastly, she has a magazine that gives her 4 times as many issues as the 6-issue one. So, that's 4 times 6, which is 24 issues. Now, we add all these up: 36 plus 6 plus 24. That's 66 issues in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out myself.

Samantha has 27 paintings. The problem says she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has:
\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]
So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

Next, the problem says Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we subtract 8 from Shelley's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Kim has:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. In November, the toy cost $40.
2. In December, the price went up by 80%. To find out how much it went up, I'll calculate 80% of $40:
   - 80% of $40 is \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - So, the new price in December is \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

3. In January, the price went down by 50%. To find out how much it went down, I'll calculate 50% of $72:
   - 50% of $72 is \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - So, the new price in January is \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"Okay, let's break it down simple-like.

Charlie teaches tennis. He charges $80 for a regular lesson. But if the person is a veteran, he gives a discount and charges only 75% of $80, which is $60.

Today, Charlie has 4 regular lessons and 2 veteran lessons. Each lesson is 1 hour long.

For the regular lessons:
4 lessons ร $80 = $320

For the veteran lessons:
2 lessons ร $60 = $120

Now, we add the money from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

So, Charlie makes $440 for the day.

So, let's add them up:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Now, we count the quizzes:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Michael is driving at 50 km per hour. He drives for 3 days. 

First, we need to know how many hours he drives in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, that's:
\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, if he drives 50 km every hour for 72 hours, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 50 \times 72 = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of this distance Michael has covered, we use this formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, we plug in the numbers:
\[ \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

4. Now, to find out how many grapes there were at the start, we add up all the grapes used:

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

So, every week, he spends:
1 dollar for pasta + 3 dollars for cheddar + 6 dollars for gruyere = 10 dollars.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

I gotta clean 80 classrooms in 5 days. Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean. So, if I do the math, 80 classrooms times 15 minutes each, that's 1200 minutes total.

Now, I work 8 hours a day. An hour has 60 minutes, so 8 hours is 480 minutes. Over 5 days, that's 5 times 480 minutes, which is 2400 minutes.

If I need to clean 1200 minutes worth of classrooms in 2400 minutes, that means I'm spending half my time cleaning. So, I'm spending 50% of my day cleaning classrooms.

Each of them middle shelves can hold 10 books, and there's 2 of 'em, so that's 20 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many as one of them middle ones, so that's 20 more. The top shelf can hold 5 less than the bottom shelf, so that's 15 books.

Now, if we add 'em all up, we get:
- Middle shelves: 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books. If one bookcase can hold 55 books, then she needs:

Let's call the number of strawberry cubes ""S"" and the number of blueberry cubes ""B.""

1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
   \[ B = 5S - 4 \]

2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   \[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now we know there are 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we use the first equation:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is:

"Well, let's see. We got 4 people in the house, and each one of 'em has a flashlight. So that's 4 flashlights. Then, there's 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights. So that's 8 rooms times 2 flashlights, which is 16 more flashlights. 

Now, for the candles. Half the rooms, which is 4 rooms, have 4 small candles each. So that's 4 rooms times 4 candles, which is 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms, which is also 4 rooms, have 5 medium candles each. So that's 4 rooms times 5 candles, which is 20 medium candles.

So, we got 16 small candles plus 20 medium candles, which is 36 candles in total.

Now, let's add up all the flashlights and candles. We got 4 flashlights for the people, 16 flashlights for the rooms, and 36 candles.

So, he makes 120 times 2, which is 240 dollars a day. June has 30 days, so if he sells all his doughnuts every day, he makes 240 times 30, which is 7200 dollars in June.

7200"
"Well, let's see. Jade took 210 pictures, and she can upload 7 pictures at a time, 6 times a day. So, she uploads 42 pictures each day. To figure out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of pictures she can upload in a day. 

210 divided by 42 is 5.

So, she needs 5 days to upload all her pictures.

"Well, let's see. Alicia drops off her clothes every week, and here's what she has:

- 5 blouses at $5 each
- 2 pants at $8 each
- 1 skirt at $6

First, we figure out how much she pays for each type of clothing in one week:

- For the blouses: 5 blouses * $5 = $25
- For the pants: 2 pants * $8 = $16
- For the skirt: 1 skirt * $6 = $6

Now, we add it all up to see how much she pays in one week:

- Total for one week: $25 + $16 + $6 = $47

Since she does this for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:

- Total for 5 weeks: $47 * 5 = $235

So, Alicia spends $235 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

235"
"Well, let's see. John talks at 150 words a minute normally. After he trains, he talks 2.5 times faster. So, we multiply 150 by 2.5 to get his new speed:

150 times 2.5 is 375 words a minute.

Now, each page has 450 words, and he's got 10 pages to talk through. So, we multiply 450 by 10 to get the total number of words:

450 times 10 is 4500 words.

To find out how long it takes him to talk all those words, we divide the total number of words by his new speed:

4500 divided by 375 is 12 minutes.

So, it takes him 12 minutes to talk through 10 pages.

12"
"Well, let's see. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach. The next day, there were 20 more people, so that's 70 people. On the third day, there were twice as many as the second day, so that's 140 people. For the rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day, and there are 4 more days, so that's 240 people.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First day: 50 people
- Second day: 70 people
- Third day: 140 people
- Last four days: 240 people

So, 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Well, let's see. Garrett's makin' some popcorn, and here's how it goes:

- First, 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds.
- Then, three times that many pop in the next 30 seconds, so that's 60 more.
- After that, four times the first amount pop in the next 30 seconds, which is 80.
- In the last 30 seconds, half as many as the last batch pop, so that's 40.
- Finally, after he takes it off the heat, a quarter of the last batch pops, so that's 10 more.

Now, let's add 'em all up:

20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

210"
"Well, let's see. Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party, and for each gallon, he needs 1 cup of lemon juice. So, for 4 gallons, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice. Now, 6 lemons give him 1 cup of juice, so for 4 cups, he needs 4 times 6 lemons, which is 24 lemons.

Now, his friend Allen wants an extra gallon, but it needs to be twice as tart. That means for Allen's gallon, he needs 2 cups of lemon juice. So, for 2 cups, he needs 2 times 6 lemons, which is 12 lemons.

So, in total, Tim needs 24 lemons for the party and 12 lemons for Allen. That's 36 lemons all together.

36"
"Well, let's see. We got 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food a day, and each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms a day. 

First, we figure out how much the German Shepherds eat in a day:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms each = 15 kilograms a day.

Next, we figure out how much the Bulldogs eat in a day:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms each = 6 kilograms a day.

Now, we add those together to get the total for one day:
15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms a day.

Since we need to know for a whole week, we multiply by 7:
21 kilograms a day * 7 days = 147 kilograms.

So, they will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

147"
"Well, let's see. If we got 10 animals with 2 legs each, that's 20 legs. And if we got 15 animals with 4 legs each, that's 60 legs. So, all together, that's 80 legs. Now, if we want to know how many pairs of legs that is, we just divide by 2, 'cause a pair is 2. So, 80 divided by 2 is 40 pairs of legs.

40"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting stuff.

First, we know there are 4 blue blocks. That's easy to remember.

Next, it says there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. So, if there are 4 blue blocks, then there must be 8 yellow blocks. That's just 4 times 2.

Now, we add up the blue and yellow blocks:
4 blue blocks + 8 yellow blocks = 12 blocks

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, to find out how many red blocks there are, we need to subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:
32 total blocks - 12 blue and yellow blocks = 20 red blocks

So, there are 20 red blocks.

"Well, let's see. Elvis drove for 5 hours going west, and he was going at 18 miles per hour. So, he went 5 times 18, which is 90 miles west. Then, he turned around and drove for 8 hours going east at the same speed, so he went 8 times 18, which is 144 miles east. 

Now, if he went 90 miles west and then 144 miles back east, he's 144 minus 90 miles from where he started. That's 54 miles. So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house.

"Well, let's see. Gary bought a boat for $9000. 

- After the first year, it lost 30% of its value. So, it lost $9000 times 0.30, which is $2700. That leaves the boat worth $9000 minus $2700, so it's worth $6300.
- In the second year, it lost another 30%. So, it lost $6300 times 0.30, which is $1890. Now the boat is worth $6300 minus $1890, so it's worth $4410.
- In the third year, it lost 20%. So, it lost $4410 times 0.20, which is $882. Now the boat is worth $4410 minus $882, so it's worth $3528.

So, after three years, the boat is worth $3528.

3528"
"Well, let's see. We got a big bag of Starbursts, and it's got 232 pieces of candy in it. Now, they tell me there are 54 red ones. The orange ones, they say, are twice as many as the red ones, so that's 108 orange ones. The yellow ones, they're only half as many as the red ones, so that's 27 yellow ones.

Now, if we add up all the red, orange, and yellow ones, we get:
54 + 108 + 27 = 189

So, if we take away all those from the total, we get:
232 - 189 = 43

So, there must be 43 pink ones left.

43"
"Well, let's see. Helen stayed at a hotel for 3 nights, and each night cost her $80. So, for the hotel, she paid:

3 nights * $80/night = $240

Now, for the bus rides, each trip cost her 10% of what one night at the hotel costs. So, each bus trip was:

10% of $80 = $8

She took the bus 7 times, so the total for the bus rides was:

7 trips * $8/trip = $56

Adding the hotel and bus costs together, Helen paid:

$240 + $56 = $296

So, Helen paid $296 for her trip.

296"
"Well, let's see. Mazie had 52 marbles and she gave them all to Dallas and Darla. Now, Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after he dropped 4. So, before he dropped them, he must've had 21 plus 4, which is 25 marbles. If Mazie had 52 marbles and Dallas got 25, then Darla must've got the rest. So, 52 minus 25 is 27.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the cost for the two adult tickets:
- Each adult ticket costs $12.
- So, for two adults, it's $12 + $12 = $24.

Next, the cost for the child ticket:
- The child ticket costs $8.

Then, the cost for the popcorns:
- They buy 2 popcorns, and each popcorn costs $3.
- So, for 2 popcorns, it's $3 + $3 = $6.

Now, let's add everything up:
- Adult tickets: $24
- Child ticket: $8
- Popcorns: $6

Total cost: $24 + $8 + $6 = $38

"Well, let's see. John's car is stuck, and he needs to push it. The car itself is pretty heavy, 1200 pounds. Then there's all the stuff in it: 250 pounds of luggage and two kids, each weighing 75 pounds. So, we add all that up:

1200 pounds for the car,
250 pounds for the luggage,
75 pounds for one kid,
75 pounds for the other kid.

That's 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75, which is 1600 pounds in total.

Now, to push the car, John needs to use a force that's 1% of the total weight. One percent is just a little bit, so we take 1% of 1600 pounds:

1% of 1600 is 16 pounds.

So, John needs to push with 16 pounds of force.

"Well, let's see. James wants to hang some crepe paper around his backyard fence. The fence is a rectangle, and it's 20 feet long on the long sides and 15 feet long on the short sides. To figure out how much crepe paper he needs, we need to add up all the sides.

So, we got:
- Two long sides: 20 feet each
- Two short sides: 15 feet each

First, we add the lengths of the long sides:
20 + 20 = 40 feet

Next, we add the lengths of the short sides:
15 + 15 = 30 feet

Now, we add the total lengths of the long sides and the short sides together:
40 + 30 = 70 feet

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

70"
"Well, let's see. Mia is 40 years old, and she's 16 years younger than Emma. So, Emma must be 56 years old. To find the average, you add their ages together and then divide by 2. That's 40 plus 56, which is 96. Then, 96 divided by 2 is 48. So, the average of their ages is 48.

48"
"Well, let's see. Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432, and Benny found 86. So, if we add all those up, that's 214 plus 432 plus 86, which makes 732 seashells in total. But, they found out that 67 of them were cracked. So, we need to take those away. If we subtract 67 from 732, we get 665 good seashells. 

665"
"Well, let's see. Avery needs to buy 3 pieces for each of the 12 people coming to dinner. That's 12 dinner plates, 12 bowls, and 12 salad plates.

- Dinner plates cost $6 each, so 12 plates will cost \( 12 \times 6 = 72 \) dollars.
- Bowls cost $5 each, so 12 bowls will cost \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \) dollars.
- Salad plates cost $4 each, so 12 plates will cost \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add it all up:
- Dinner plates: $72
- Bowls: $60
- Salad plates: $48

So, \( 72 + 60 + 48 = 180 \) dollars.

Avery will spend $180 on the place settings.

"Well, let's see. Dexter's got five pigs, and each one eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, each pig eats 8 pounds a day. With five pigs, that's 40 pounds a day for all of 'em. 

Now, a week is 7 days, so the pigs will eat 40 pounds a day times 7 days, which is 280 pounds in a week. 

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. If the pigs eat 280 pounds in a week, then there'll be 300 pounds minus 280 pounds left, which is 20 pounds.

"Well, let's see. John's throwin' a party and he's got 20 folks comin'. Each one's gonna eat 2 hot dogs. So, that's 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs he needs. He's got 4 hot dogs left from last time, so he needs 40 minus 4, which is 36 more hot dogs.

Now, the hot dogs come in packs of 6, and each pack costs $2. So, he needs 36 divided by 6, which is 6 packs. Six packs at $2 each, that's 6 times 2, which is $12.

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

12"
"Well, let's see. Frances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so that's 20 times 2, which is $40. She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, so that's 40 times 1, which is another $40. So, she makes $40 from cupcakes and $40 from cookies, which adds up to $80.

Now, she buys 5 trays, and each tray costs $4. So, 5 times 4 is $20. 

She had $80 and spent $20 on trays, so she has $80 minus $20 left, which is $60.

"Well, let's see. At first, there were 5 kids with the ice cream truck. Then, on the next street, each of those 5 kids brought a friend, so that made 10 kids. On the third street, each of those 10 kids brought 2 more friends, so that's 20 more kids, making it 30 kids in total. But then, the original 5 kids got tired and left. So, 30 minus 5 is 25. 

So, there are 25 kids following the truck now.

"Well, let's see. Mamou had 1,360 meals to give out. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 on Saturday, and 48 on Sunday. So, if we add those up, that's 64 + 30 + 48, which is 142 meals. Now, if we take 142 away from 1,360, we get 1,218 meals left. So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to give out.

1218"
"Well, let's see. James found a quarter, which is 25 cents. He also found two nickels, and each nickel is 5 cents, so that's 10 cents. Then he found 7 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so that's 70 cents. 

Now, let's add it all up:
25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (two nickels) + 70 cents (seven dimes) = 105 cents

So, James has 105 cents.

"Well, let's see. Charisma does her meditation two times a day, 15 minutes each time. So, that's 30 minutes a day. She does this every day, so in one week, that's 30 minutes times 7 days, which is 210 minutes. Over 4 weeks, that's 210 minutes times 4, which is 840 minutes.

Now, for yoga, she does it 5 days a week for 1 hour each time. An hour is 60 minutes, so that's 60 minutes times 5 days, which is 300 minutes a week. Over 4 weeks, that's 300 minutes times 4, which is 1200 minutes.

So, if we add the meditation and yoga together, that's 840 minutes plus 1200 minutes, which is 2040 minutes.

"Well, let's see. I'm gonna figure this out step by step, just like I would if I was countin' my chickens.

First, I got 11 small shirts, and each one of 'em is 3 square feet. So, I do 11 times 3, which gives me 33 square feet.

Next, I got 8 medium shirts, and each one of those is 4 square feet. So, I do 8 times 4, which gives me 32 square feet.

Then, I got 6 large shirts, and each one of those is 6 square feet. So, I do 6 times 6, which gives me 36 square feet.

Now, I add all of 'em up: 33 plus 32 plus 36. That's 101 square feet.

So, the quilt is gonna be 101 square feet.

"Well, let's see. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Now, 3 dozen is 36 seeds, 'cause 12 seeds make a dozen.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small one. So, 50% of 36 is 18, 'cause half of 36 is 18. Add that to the 36 seeds from the small sunflower, and you get 54 seeds for the large sunflower.

Now, to find out how many seeds there are altogether, you just add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 seeds from the small one and 54 seeds from the large one. That's 90 seeds in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, the company makes 5000 chocolate bars every day. That's a lot of chocolate!

Now, we need to know how many days are in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks would be:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the company makes in those 14 days. If they make 5000 bars each day, then in 14 days they make:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Now, the company sells each bar for $2. So, to find out how much money they make from selling all 70000 bars, we do:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the company will receive $140,000 for selling all the chocolate bars during two weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Jake buys two T-shirts. The store has a deal where you buy one and get the second one at half price. Each T-shirt costs $8.

- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays $8.
- For the second T-shirt, he pays half of $8, which is $4.

So, the total for the T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that are 40% off. The original price of the shoes is $40.

- The discount is 40%, so he pays 60% of the original price.
- 60% of $40 is:
\[ 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ 36 \]"
"Well, let's see. Ryan gets 6 dollars each week for doin' his chores. He did 'em for 3 weeks, so that's:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

He bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream costs 1.25 dollars, so:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

After buyin' the ice cream, he has:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, movie tickets cost 6.50 dollars each. So, he can buy:
\[ \frac{13}{6.50} = 2 \, \text{tickets} \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"Well, let's see. Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, Ellen spent $100 + $5, which is $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each. So, Lani spent $30 + $100 + $100, which is $230.

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add Ellen's and Lani's totals together: $105 + $230. That's $335.

So, they spent $335 in all.

"Well, let's see. Tim makes this special mix, and for each jar, he needs some fruits and honey. He uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, which costs $6 a pound, so that's $12. Then, he uses 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, which costs $8 a pound, so that's $12 too. He also needs 2 pounds of honey, which costs $10 a pound, so that's $20. 

So, to make one jar, it costs him $12 for the passion fruit, $12 for the jackfruit, and $20 for the honey. That adds up to $44 for one jar.

Now, if he sells each jar for $50, he makes $6 profit on each jar because $50 minus $44 is $6.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes 10 times $6, which is $60.

So, the profit he makes from selling 10 jars is $60.

"Well, let's see. I ain't no expert, but I can count and do some simple math. 

First, we got 32 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so:
32 quarters times 25 cents each equals 800 cents, which is 8 dollars.

Next, there are 95 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so:
95 dimes times 10 cents each equals 950 cents, which is 9.50 dollars.

Then, we got 120 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so:
120 nickels times 5 cents each equals 600 cents, which is 6 dollars.

Lastly, there are 750 pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so:
750 pennies times 1 cent each equals 750 cents, which is 7.50 dollars.

Now, we add all that up:
8 dollars + 9.50 dollars + 6 dollars + 7.50 dollars = 31 dollars.

So, the total amount in the jar is 31 dollars."
"Well, let's see. Janet's parents gave her $40. She spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 on a movie ticket for herself, and another $7.50 on a movie ticket for her sister, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 

So, let's add up what she spent:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, add it all together:
$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

She started with $40.00, so:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting cookies in my kitchen.

First, Randy starts with:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

Then, he eats 3 cookies for a snack, one of each kind:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Next, he eats 2 more oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

After that, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Finally, he bakes 4 more of each kind of cookie for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
- Oatmeal cookies: 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 7
- Sugar cookies: 6

Total cookies: 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

So, Randy has 23 cookies now.

"Well, let's see. Matthew has 12 toy soldiers, and he wants to sell them. The buyer is offering $5 for each of the first 6 toy soldiers and $7 for each of the other 6 toy soldiers.

So, for the first 6 toy soldiers:
6 toy soldiers ร $5 each = $30

And for the other 6 toy soldiers:
6 toy soldiers ร $7 each = $42

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$30 + $42 = $72

So, Matthew would earn $72.

"Well, let's see. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and he does that for 14 days while Nate's away. So, that's 6 times 14, which is 84 holes. When Nate gets back, he fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night. So, Nate really only fills 3 holes a day (9 minus 6). To fill 84 holes at 3 holes a day, it would take 84 divided by 3, which is 28 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, 28 days is 4 weeks.

\[ 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School has 3000 students. Now, to find out how many more students Norman High School has compared to Butler High School, we subtract:

4000 - 3000 = 1000

Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School.

"Well, let's see. They made 7995 cookies in total. Out of those, 2595 are rainbow cookies and 3075 are oatmeal cookies. To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to take the total and subtract the rainbow and oatmeal cookies.

So, 7995 minus 2595 is 5400. Then, 5400 minus 3075 is 2325.

So, they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Well, let's see here. Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. But Igor only got half as many test tubes, which is 8, and he got 2 more Petri dishes than asked for, so that's 16 Petri dishes. He did get the right number of beakers, which is 7, but he lost some on the way.

Now, if we add up what Igor actually put on the lab bench, we got 8 test tubes, some beakers, and 16 Petri dishes, and all together that's 29 items.

So, let's count it out:
8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items
29 total items - 24 items = 5 beakers

But he was supposed to have 7 beakers, so he must have lost:
7 beakers - 5 beakers = 2 beakers

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"Well, let's see. James is putting together 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, that's 4 legs times 2 screws, which is 8 screws. For 4 tables, that's 4 times 8 screws, which is 32 screws. James has 40 screws. If he uses 32 screws, he'll have 40 minus 32, which is 8 screws left over.

"Well, if there's 10 eggs in one basket and the other basket has twice as many, that means the second basket has 20 eggs. So, if you put them all together, you got 10 eggs plus 20 eggs, which makes 30 eggs.

"Well, let's see. Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than her, so Kim raised $750. Sarah raised $300, and Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $700. Now, if we add all that up:

$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180

So, they all raised $2180 in total.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about running and time.

Aaron and Vanessa are on a relay team. Vanessa can run 4 miles, and she can run twice as far as Aaron. So, Aaron must have run 2 miles.

Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it means Vanessa takes twice as long to run the same distance.

So, if Aaron takes 16 minutes to run 2 miles, Vanessa would take 16 minutes to run 1 mile. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, she would take 4 times 16 minutes.

4 times 16 is 64.

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"Well, let's see. The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. He's got 200 feet of dock, so he needs 3 times that much in line. That's 600 feet of line. He already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy the rest. 

600 feet minus the 6 feet he already has is 594 feet. So, he needs to buy 594 feet of line.

594"
"Well, let's see. Tom's place gets 6 reservations every night it's open. Each person orders 2 meals that cost $5 each, and a bottle of wine that's $5. So, for each reservation, that's 2 meals at $5, which is $10, plus a $5 bottle of wine. That makes $15 per reservation.

Now, if there are 6 reservations a night, and each one brings in $15, that's 6 times $15, which is $90 for one night.

Since the place is open 2 days a week, we take the $90 from one night and multiply it by 2. So, $90 times 2 is $180.

So, Tom's place makes $180 a week.

"Well, let's see. The man bought 50 watermelons for $80. He made a 25% profit on top of what he paid. 

First, we need to figure out how much extra money he made. If he made a 25% profit, that means he made an extra 25% of $80. 

25% of $80 is $20. So, he made $20 extra.

Now, we add that extra money to what he originally paid: $80 + $20 = $100. That's how much he made in total from selling all the watermelons.

To find out how much he sold each watermelon for, we divide the total money he made by the number of watermelons he sold. 

$100 divided by 50 watermelons is $2 per watermelon.

So, he sold each watermelon for $2.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she must be 9 years old right now.
2. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 18 years old.
3. John had James when he was 19, so John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, the answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange. We want to know how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane in one hour.

First, let's figure out how many oranges each can peel in one hour:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Ana can peel one orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- Jane can peel one orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, let's find out how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Well, let's see. The radiator costs $400, but the guy at the junk shop gives me 80% off. That means I only pay 20% of $400. 

To figure out 20% of $400, I can just do:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs me $80.

Then, the mechanic charges $50 an hour for 3 hours. That's:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, I add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's work:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, Mark paid:

"Well, let's see. Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they all have legs. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. If all the animals were chickens, they would have 40 legs in total (20 chickens * 2 legs each). But we know there are 70 legs in total.

So, the extra legs must be from the cows. Each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken. The difference between 70 legs and 40 legs is 30 legs. If each cow adds 2 extra legs, then there must be 15 cows (30 extra legs / 2 legs per cow).

If there are 15 cows, then the rest of the animals must be chickens. So, 20 animals - 15 cows = 5 chickens.

"Well, let's see. Henry and his 3 friends, that makes 4 of them. They got 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 pieces. So, 7 pizzas times 8 pieces each, that's 56 pieces in total. Now, if they want to share these 56 pieces equally among the 4 of them, we just divide 56 by 4. That gives us 14 pieces each.
