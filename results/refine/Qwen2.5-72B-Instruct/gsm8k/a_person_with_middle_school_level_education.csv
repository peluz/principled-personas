"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. 

Next, Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. So, she uses a total of:
3 + 4 = 7 eggs

This means the number of eggs left for her to sell is:
16 - 7 = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2. So, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To figure out how many bolts of fiber are needed for a robe, let's break it down:

- The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It also needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So, half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts of blue fiber} + 1 \text{ bolt of white fiber} = 3 \text{ bolts in total} \]

So, the total number of bolts needed is:
3"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find the total cost of the house:**
   - Josh bought the house for $80,000.
   - He spent $50,000 on repairs.
   - So, the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

2. **Calculate the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - 150% of $80,000 is calculated as 1.5 times $80,000.
   - 1.5 Ã— $80,000 = $120,000.
   - So, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

3. **Find the profit:**
   - Profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost.
   - So, the profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

James runs 3 sprints each time he goes out. Each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week.

First, we find out how many meters he runs in one session:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Next, we find out how many meters he runs in a week:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs 540 meters a week.

540"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much feed all the chickens need in a day. Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed, and Wendi has 20 chickens. So, we multiply:
   \[
   3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Next, we need to see how much feed Wendi has already given. In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. So, we add these together:
   \[
   15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much more feed is needed for the final meal. We subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
   \[
   60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses.

1. Each glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's break it down:
- For every two glasses, the first one costs $5 and the second one costs $3.
- So, for every two glasses, the total cost is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to find out how many pairs of glasses that is:
- 16 glasses divided by 2 glasses per pair equals 8 pairs.

Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs:
- \(8 \text{ dollars per pair} \times 8 \text{ pairs} = 64 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we multiply the number of sheep in Seattle by 4:
   \[
   20 \times 4 = 80
   \]
   So, Charleston has 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2:
   \[
   80 \times 2 = 160
   \]
   So, Toulouse has 160 sheep.
4. Now, we add up the number of sheep in all three cities:
   \[
   20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
260"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, figure out how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart:**
   - The file is 200 GB.
   - Carla downloads 40% of it before the restart.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.

2. **Next, calculate how long it takes to download 80 GB:**
   - Carla downloads at a speed of 2 GB per minute.
   - So, to download 80 GB, it takes \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \) minutes.

3. **Add the time for the Windows restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.
   - So, the total time so far is \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \) minutes.

4. **Finally, calculate the time to download the full 200 GB file again:**
   - Carla has to start over, so she needs to download the entire 200 GB.
   - At 2 GB per minute, it takes \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \) minutes.

5. **Add the time for the full download to the total time:**
   - The total time is \( 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \) minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for the first part:

\[ \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

John is now 180 miles away from home.

Next, he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. But he spends the first 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he doesn't move at all during that time.

After the 2 hours, he drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. Let's calculate how far he goes in that time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

So, he covers 15 miles in the first half-hour after the traffic.

Then, he drives for the remaining time at 80 miles per hour. The remaining time is:

\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate how far he goes in the last 1.5 hours:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, he covers 120 miles in the last 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the distances he traveled back home:

\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we need to find out how far he is from home. He was 180 miles away initially, and he traveled back 135 miles:

\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

45"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Eliza made this week. 

First, we need to know how much she makes for the first 40 hours. She gets $10 for each of those hours. So, for 40 hours, she makes:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much she makes for the extra hours. She worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 5 hours of overtime. For overtime, she gets 1.2 times her regular rate. Her regular rate is $10, so her overtime rate is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 1.2 = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

For the 5 hours of overtime, she makes:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total earnings:
\[ 400 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 460 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
460"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times as many as the first month.
   - So, \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) downloads.

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - To find 30% of 180, we do \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - So, the downloads in the third month are \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - Now, we add up the downloads from all three months.
   - Total downloads = \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"Okay, let's figure out how much Toula spent at the bakery. I'll break it down step by step.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, the total cost for the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

So, the total cost is $694.

694"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Initial Cost**: Carlos needs to spend $90 to plant the lemon tree.
2. **Lemons per Year**: The tree will grow 7 lemons each year.
3. **Price per Lemon**: Each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
4. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: It costs $3 each year to water and feed the tree.

First, let's calculate how much money Carlos makes from selling lemons each year:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \]

Next, let's find out how much money Carlos spends each year to water and feed the tree:
\[ \$3 \]

Now, let's find out the net profit (money made minus money spent) each year:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back the $90 he spent to plant the tree, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in math class.

1. **First, we know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left at the end.**

2. **Before she got to the orange house, she had twice as many vacuum cleaners as she has now.** This is because she sold half of what she had left at the orange house. So, before the orange house, she had:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

3. **Before she got to the red house, she had 2 more vacuum cleaners than she had before the orange house.** This is because she sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, before the red house, she had:
   \[
   10 + 2 = 12 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

4. **Before she got to the green house, she had three times as many vacuum cleaners as she had before the red house.** This is because she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, before the green house, she had:
   \[
   12 \times 3 = 36 \div 2 = 18 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Total number of students in the dance class:** 20

2. **Students enrolled in contemporary dance:**
   - 20% of 20 students = \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) students

3. **Remaining students after contemporary dance:**
   - 20 students - 4 students = 16 students

4. **Students enrolled in jazz dance:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students = \( 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \) students

5. **Remaining students after jazz dance:**
   - 16 students - 4 students = 12 students

6. **Students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - 12 students

7. **Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - \( \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \)

So, the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance is:
60%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Jewelry:**
   - The jewelry costs $5,000.
   - The market is expected to go up by 2.5%.
   - To find the profit, we need to calculate 2.5% of $5,000.
   - \( 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \)
   - So, the profit from jewelry is $125.

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - The electronic gadgets cost $8,000.
   - The market is expected to go up by 1.2%.
   - To find the profit, we need to calculate 1.2% of $8,000.
   - \( 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \)
   - So, the profit from electronic gadgets is $96.

Now, let's compare the two profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to make the most money.

The maximum profit is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Two trains leave San Rafael and travel west for 80 miles. Then, the next day, they travel north for 150 miles. To find out how far each train traveled in total, we just need to add these two distances together.

First, we add the distance traveled west:
80 miles

Then, we add the distance traveled north:
150 miles

Now, we add these two distances:
80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

So, each train traveled a total of 230 miles in the two days.

230 miles"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jill makes in a year from her two jobs.

First, we need to find out how much she makes each week from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She gets paid $20 for each hour.
- So, 35 hours times $20 equals $700 a week from teaching.

Next, let's find out how much she makes each week from being a cheerleading coach:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She gets paid $30 for each hour.
- So, 15 hours times $30 equals $450 a week from coaching.

Now, let's add up her weekly earnings from both jobs:
- $700 from teaching plus $450 from coaching equals $1150 a week.

Jill works for 50 weeks a year, so we need to find out how much she makes in a year:
- $1150 a week times 50 weeks equals $57,500 a year.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
3. We need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks. So, 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she uses. So, 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 more miles in another hour. So, she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours.

To find out how fast she needs to walk the rest of the trail, we need to figure out how much time she has left and how far she still needs to go.

1. **Total Distance**: 12 miles
2. **Distance Already Walked**: 6 miles
3. **Remaining Distance**: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find out the total time she should take to complete the trail, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

She has already taken 2 hours, so the remaining time she has is:

\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much water is in the orange drink. The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

But we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so we only have 9 liters left. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we look at the pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we mix the remaining 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total volume of the mixture is:

\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:

\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old right now.
2. Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so we add 6 to Samantha's age to find Raymond's age:
   \[
   31 + 6 = 37
   \]
   So, Raymond is 37 years old now.
3. Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago that was, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
   \[
   37 - 23 = 14

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday. 

- The first 3 customers each buy 1 DVD. So, that's 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs. So, that's 2 times 2, which is 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. So, that's 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add them up:
3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Kyle bought the book for $19.50, and this price is after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price. 

To find the original price, we need to figure out what 100% (the full price) would be. 

Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. Let's call the original price \( P \).
2. Since $19.50 is 75% of \( P \), we can write the equation:
   \[
   0.75 \times P = 19.50
   \]
3. To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
   \[
   P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
   \]
4. Now, let's do the division:
   \[
   P = 26
   \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up the cost of all the items Marie bought, except for the pizza.

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- Each pack of milk costs $3, and she bought 5 packs, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Each apple costs $1.50, and she bought 4 apples, so that's \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount she spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\].

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items.

First, we need to find out how much Mishka spent on each type of clothing:

1. **Shorts:**
   - One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - So, the total cost for the shorts is \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \) dollars.

2. **Pants:**
   - One pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - So, the total cost for the pants is \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \) dollars.

3. **Shoes:**
   - One pair of shoes costs $42.00.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - So, the total cost for the shoes is \( 3 \times 42.00 = 126.00 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the total costs for all the items:

- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126.00

So, the total amount Mishka spent is:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00 = 243.00 \]

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find out how many servings Cynthia eats in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - So, in 60 days, she will eat:
     \[
     1 \text{ serving/night} \times 60 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs:**
   - Each carton has 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - So, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Henry went on a 60-mile bike trip. He made two stops:
1. His first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to figure out where his second stop was. Since the trip is 60 miles long and he stopped 15 miles before the end, his second stop was at:

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know:
- First stop: 20 miles
- Second stop: 45 miles

To find the distance between these two stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know that one pair of high heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair. So, the second pair costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
3. Now, we add the costs of both pairs of high heels: \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.
4. The problem says that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if the boots cost \( B \) dollars, then:
   \[
   99 = B - 5
   \]
5. To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to 99:
   \[
   B = 99 + 5 = 104
   \]

So, the boots cost \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years.
2. Their total age now is 162 years. We can use this to find out how many years each part of the ratio represents.
3. If we add the parts of the ratio together, we get 7 + 11 = 18 parts.
4. So, each part of the ratio represents \( \frac{162}{18} = 9 \) years.
5. Now, we can find Darrell's age by multiplying his part of the ratio by 9: \( 7 \times 9 = 63 \) years.
6. Similarly, we can find Allen's age by multiplying his part of the ratio by 9: \( 11 \times 9 = 99 \) years.
7. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: \( 99 + 10 = 109 \) years.

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109. 

109"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. To find 25% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.25, which is 20. So, 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. To do that, we add up all the guesses and then divide by the number of guesses.

\[
\text{Total guesses} = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

\[
\text{Number of guesses} = 3
\]

\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80."

John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog needs 0.5 hours a day for walking and taking care of their business. 

First, we need to find out how many hours John spends on the dogs each day:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends on the dogs each week. There are 7 days in a week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Gretchen has 110 coins in total. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's use some simple math to find out how many gold coins she has.

1. Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \).
2. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

Now, we know the total number of coins is 110. So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Combine like terms:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

2. Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 2S = 80 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, to find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. The problem says that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Raymond has 40 jewels, so half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Now, Aaron has 5 more than this, so:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem says that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

First, let's figure out how many more points he scored in the second 20 minutes. 

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, let's add the points from both periods:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, the total points Mike scored is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   - So, in 30 days, he eats: 
     \[
     2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of one yogurt:**
   - The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - So, the cost of one yogurt is:
     \[
     \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**
   - The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
     \[
     60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, Terry spends **$75.00** on yogurt over 30 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money John made from selling his lego sets. He sold 13 lego sets for $15 each. So, we multiply 13 by 15:

13 Ã— 15 = 195

So, John made $195 from selling his lego sets.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on the video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each. So, we multiply 8 by 20:

8 Ã— 20 = 160

So, John spent $160 on the video games.

Now, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying the video games. We subtract the amount he spent on the video games from the total amount he made from selling the lego sets:

195 - 160 = 35

John has $35 left after buying the video games. But the problem says he has $5 left. This means he must have spent the rest of the money on something else, but we don't need to worry about that for this problem.

Finally, the question asks how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 of his lego sets, he has:

0

So, John has 0 lego sets left."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's add up the total time he spends running each week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we know he runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find Dana's running speed:**
   - We know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - So, running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Find Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - So, walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \(6 \div 3 = 2\) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - Running distance = \(6\) miles per hour Ã— \(2\) hours = \(12\) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \(1.5\) miles per hour Ã— \(4\) hours = \(6\) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \(12\) miles + \(6\) miles = \(18\) miles.

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Polly can normally throw the gold javelin 400 feet.
2. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
3. So, with the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin:
   \[
   400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet.
5. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
   \[
   1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, we multiply:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still eat today. You have a daily target of 2000 calories, and you've already eaten 1800 calories. So, we subtract:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many grams of chips 200 calories is. The whole bag is 300 grams and has 1250 calories. To find out how many grams are in 200 calories, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply and divide:

\[ 300 \text{ grams} \times 200 \text{ calories} = 1250 \text{ calories} \times x \text{ grams} \]

\[ 60000 = 1250x \]

\[ x = \frac{60000}{1250} \]

\[ x = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"Okay, let's figure out Charlie's net profit step by step.

1. **How much beeswax does Charlie need?**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs \( \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \).

2. **How much does the beeswax and wicks cost?**
   - One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00.
   - For 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **How much money does Charlie make from selling the candles?**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - For 20 candles, the total revenue is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **What is Charlie's net profit?**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. She bought a package of Post-it notes, but we don't know how many were in the package yet. Let's call that number \( x \).
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes.
4. After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

First, let's find out how many Post-it notes she had before she used any. We know she had 23 left after using 220, so before using them, she had:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Now, we know she started with 80 Post-it notes and bought a package with \( x \) Post-it notes. So, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using any is:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of one tie:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, if he bought 5 blue ties, he must have bought:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, we need to find out how much each red tie costs. The problem says that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

So, each red tie costs $60. Now, we can find out how much John spent on the red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of one red tie:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties to get the total amount spent on all ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800

   So, there are 120 units in the building.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4:
   \[
   120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90
   \]
   So, 90 units are occupied.

3. Finally, to find out how many units are unoccupied, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

2. **Calculate how long it takes to travel back:**
   - On the way back, Tom's ship goes 6 miles every hour.
   - The distance to travel back is the same, 30 miles.
   - To find the time, we use the formula: Time = Distance Ã· Speed.

So, by removing 30 comic books, Uriah has already removed 7.5 pounds. But he needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. So, he still needs to remove:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many toys he needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so:
\[ \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Each truck tire costs $60 to fix, and each car tire costs $40 to fix.

First, let's calculate the money made from the truck tires on Thursday:
- 6 truck tires Ã— $60 per tire = $360

Next, let's calculate the money made from the car tires on Thursday:
- 4 car tires Ã— $40 per tire = $160

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total revenue for Thursday:
- $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic only fixed car tires. He fixed 12 car tires, and each car tire costs $40 to fix.

Let's calculate the money made from the car tires on Friday:
- 12 car tires Ã— $40 per tire = $480

Now, we need to find out how much more money the mechanic made on the day with the higher revenue. We compare the total revenue from Thursday and Friday:
- Thursday: $520

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch. Then, she pays $800 for the jeweler to construct it. So, the total cost for the material and the construction is:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet has to pay 10% of this total cost to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we do:
\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the material and construction:
\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, Janet paid a total of:
\[ 1430 \]

1430"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Marcy gets a full pension of $50,000 per year if she works for 40 years.
2. After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of the full pension for each year she works beyond 20 years.
3. Marcy works for 30 years, so she works 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.

Now, let's calculate how much 5% of the full pension is:
5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500

Since she works 10 years beyond 20 years, she gets 10 times $2,500:
10 * $2,500 = $25,000

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be:
$25,000

$25,000"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much Aleena pays for the first half of the year. The streaming service charges her $140 each month. There are 6 months in the first half of the year.

So, for the first half of the year:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, for the second half of the year, the streaming service charges her 10% less. We need to find out what 10% of $140 is:
\[ 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract this amount from the original monthly charge to find the new monthly charge:
\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

There are also 6 months in the second half of the year, so:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the amounts for both halves of the year to get the total amount Aleena paid:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find out how many miles Sophia's car can go on one gallon of gas:**
   - Sophia drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas.
   - To find out how many miles she can go on one gallon, we divide the miles by the gallons:
   - 100 miles Ã· 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

2. **Calculate how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank:**
   - The car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
   - To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank:
   - 25 miles per gallon Ã— 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Time spent in one session:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
   - Then he reads for half as long, which is 1 hour (because half of 2 is 1).

   So, in one session, he spends:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Time spent in one week:**
   - Jim does this 3 times a week.
   - So, in one week, he spends:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

3. **Time spent in 4 weeks:**
   - In 4 weeks, he spends:
   \[
   9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each team also has a coach.

So, for each school:
- Girls' team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people
- Boys' team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people

Now, add the people from both teams for one school:
- 6 (girls' team) + 6 (boys' team) = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people from one school by 4:
- 12 people per school * 4 schools = 48 people

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48.

48"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Diamonds**: The problem says there are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: It also says there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, we need to subtract 35 from the number of diamonds:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 rubies.
3. **Emeralds**: The problem says there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. So, we need to multiply the number of rubies by 2:
   \[
   140 \times 2 = 280
   \]
   So, there are 280 emeralds.

Now, let's add up all the gems:
\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school.
2. The problem says there are twice as many boys as girls. So, if there are 60 girls, then there must be 2 times 60 boys, which is 120 boys.
3. Now, we need to find the total number of students. We add the number of girls and boys together: 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.
4. The problem also tells us that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by 5: 180 students Ã· 5 = 36 teachers.

So, the number of teachers is 36.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Bailey gets $5 every week for 8 weeks. So, we need to find out how much money she got in total from her allowance. We do this by multiplying the amount she gets each week by the number of weeks:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, Bailey got $40 from her allowance over 8 weeks.

Now, we know that at the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has $100 in total. This $100 includes the money she started with plus the $40 she got from her allowance. To find out how much money she started with, we subtract the $40 from the $100:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Judy makes in one week from teaching dance classes.

First, we need to know how many classes she teaches in a week:
- On weekdays, she teaches 5 classes each day. There are 5 weekdays, so that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Next, we need to find out how many students she has in total:
- Each class has 15 students.
- So, the total number of students is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Now, we need to calculate how much money she makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student.
- So, the total money she makes is 495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00.

Therefore, Judy makes $7425.00 in one week.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Shiela will pay each month for the cell phones.

1. First, we need to find out how much the cell phones cost without any interest. Shiela bought 5 cell phones, and each one costs $150.
   \[
   5 \text{ phones} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} = \$750
   \]

2. Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest is 2% of the total cost of the cell phones.
   \[
   2\% \text{ of } \$750 = 0.02 \times \$750 = \$15
   \]

3. Now, we add the interest to the total cost to find out the total amount Shiela will pay.
   \[
   \$750 + \$15 = \$765

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels. Each level has half the square footage of the level below it. The top level (4th level) has 16 square feet.

1. **4th Level:** 16 square feet
2. **3rd Level:** Since the 3rd level is twice the size of the 4th level, it has \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) square feet.
3. **2nd Level:** The 2nd level is twice the size of the 3rd level, so it has \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) square feet.
4. **1st Level:** The 1st level is twice the size of the 2nd level, so it has \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \) square feet.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all the levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for her new puppy in the first year.

First, we need to know how much food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. The vet said to feed the puppy 1 cup of food each day for the first 180 days. So, we do:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, for the rest of the year, which is 365 days minus the first 180 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of food each day. So, we calculate:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

1. First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much laundry David does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 4:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, to find out how much laundry Raymond does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 2:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. We subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

"To figure out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in two different ways: in packages of 3 for $2.50 each and in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package has 3 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, we need \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Each package costs $2.50, so 6 packages cost \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package has 2 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, we need \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Each package costs $1, so 9 packages cost \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 costs $15.
- Buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 costs $9.

The difference in cost is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

The football team played 22 games in total. We know they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's use some simple math to figure out how many games they won.

1. Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \).
2. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

Now, we know the total number of games they played is 22. So, we can write an equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( L \):

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Now, we can find out how many games they won:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

First, we need to know how much each type of dinosaur will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 5 pounds of potato salad.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults:
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Each adult eats 10 pounds.
- So, the total for the adults is 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children:
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Each child eats 5 pounds.
- So, the total for the children is 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

Finally, we add the amounts for the adults and the children to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad = 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Combined Number of Dogs and Cats:**
   - Now, let's add the number of dogs and cats together:
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Number of Rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Total Number of Pets:**
   - Finally, we add up all the pets:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
348

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many boys and girls there are in Grade 5. We know there are 200 students in total, and 2/5 of them are boys.

1. Calculate the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
   \]

2. Now, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the Girl Scouts. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts.

3. Calculate the number of girls in the Girl Scouts:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
   \]

Finally, we need to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts. We do this by subtracting the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls.

4. Calculate the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40
   \]

So, the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is:
\[
40

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. 

First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. We do this by multiplying 9 by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James slept 6 hours.

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much the tomatoes shrink when Freda cooks them. The problem says they lose half their volume. So, if the sauce is 32 ounces, the tomatoes must have been twice that much before cooking.
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used. Each can has 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. Each can contains 3 tomatoes. So, if Freda used 4 cans, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. Then, 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially was 30, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many potted plants Mary has in total. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, we multiply:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. So, we add these to the 80 plants she already has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Now, Mary is going to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family. So, we need to subtract the 40 plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will have left is:

58"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more times than the first friend. So, we need to find 1/4 of 20 and add it to 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 more times than the fourth friend:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]
   So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell was pressed:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is:
175"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up all the pages Solo has to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

So, the total number of pages is:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, so we need to subtract those from the total:
39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Solo has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 Ã· 4 = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

John drinks water 4 times a day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
4 glasses/day Ã— 5 days = 20 glasses

On the weekends, John drinks water 3 times a day. There are 2 weekend days, so:
3 glasses/day Ã— 2 days = 6 glasses

Now, let's add the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses

So, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week.

1. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
2. The city is 42 miles wide.

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 14 segments, if each segment takes 10 minutes:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we do:

\[
\frac{750}{3} = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, Poppy's mom places 250 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out the inner dimensions of one box. The walls of the box are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each side (1 inch from each side of the box).

- The outer length of the box is 5 inches. So, the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.
- The outer width of the box is 6 inches. So, the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.
- The outer height of the box is 4 inches. So, the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner length, width, and height:

- Inner volume of one box = 3 inches Ã— 4 inches Ã— 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we need to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:

- Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches Ã— 3 = 72 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Okay, let's figure out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.

First, let's add up the time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, except for Wednesday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours (1 hour + 1 hour)

Now, let's add these times together:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes make up 1.5 hours:
1.5 hours Ã· 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

2. Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, the number of cookies he intended to bake is:
   \[
   115 - 15 = 100 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. So, the number of cookies he baked last year is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much the gas costs before any cashback. The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and you're buying 10 gallons.
   - So, the total cost before cashback is $3.00 * 10 = $30.00.

2. Next, we need to figure out how much cashback you get. The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon, and you're buying 10 gallons.
   - So, the total cashback is $0.20 * 10 = $2.00.

3. Finally, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find out how much you actually pay.
   - The total cost after cashback is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

So, after the cashback rewards, the gas will cost you $28.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Beatrice's Fruit Roll-Ups:**
   - Beatrice's roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
   - To find out how many roll-ups she ate, we multiply the width by the length:
     \[
     2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - So, Beatrice ate 48 roll-ups.

2. **Marcell's Fruit Roll-Ups:**
   - Marcell's roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
   - To find out how many roll-ups he ate, we multiply the width by the length:
     \[
     3 \times 14 = 42
     \]
   - So, Marcell ate 42 roll-ups.

3. **Total Fruit Roll-Ups Eaten:**
   - To find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both, we add the number of roll-ups each ate:
     \[
     48 + 42 = 90
     \]

4. **Average Number of Fruit Roll-Ups Eaten:**
   - To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
     \[
     \frac{90}{2} = 45

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, we can find her rowing speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how far she rowed in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, we need to find out how much water the boat took on for 80 feet:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

Next, we need to find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned during each lesson. The problem says the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. So, we multiply the number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day} \]

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Jamal's Phone Capacity:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

2. **Brittany's Phone Capacity:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.

3. **Number of Ducks:**
   - The number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let's call the number of ducks \( d \).
   - So, \( 300 = 50 \times d \).

4. **Solving for \( d \):**
   - To find \( d \), we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

"Okay, let's figure out how much profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber.

First, we need to find out how much she spent on the lumber:
- She bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She also bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can sell the lumber for now that prices have gone up by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate how much she will make from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- So, the total revenue from selling all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90

3. **Total Amount Used:**
   - We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120.

4. **Find the Value of One Part:**
   - If 20 parts equal 120, then one part is \( \frac{120}{20} = 6 \).

5. **Calculate the Amount of Sugar:**

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. This was 30% more than Lylah's salary. To find out what Lylah's salary was, we can set up a simple equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 30\% \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

This can be written as:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Combining the terms on the right side:

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

To find Lylah's salary, we divide both sides by 1.30:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was about $30,769.23.

Next, we need to find out what Adrien's salary is now. We know it increased by 40% from what it was four years ago. So we calculate:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 40\% \times 40000 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find out what Lylah's salary is now. Since her salary increased by the same percentage (40%), we calculate:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 40\% \times 30769.23 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, to find the total salary they are receiving now, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]

\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

1. **Monday:**
   - Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday.
   - So, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day.
   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday: \(6 + 6 = 12\) hours.

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   - She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - So, on these days, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.

2. **Next 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, she slows down to 5 miles per hour.
   - So, in the next 4 hours, she runs: \(5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total distance:**
   - To find the total distance, we add the distances from both parts: \(30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles}\).

So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

Jennie has 60 letters that need stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. To find out how many letters she stamped, we need to divide 60 by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before Jennie started, there were:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. Julia bought a package of spoons. Let's call the number of spoons in that package \( x \).
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to taste the stew.
4. After all this, Julia had 12 spoons left.

So, we can write an equation to figure out how many spoons Julia originally bought. The total number of spoons she had before using any is the number of spoons she bought plus the 5 spoons her husband bought. Then, she used 3 spoons, so we subtract 3 from the total.

The equation looks like this:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. To find out how many sausages Dylan bought in total, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.

82"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. So, we need to add 20 to the number of friends Lily made to find out how many friends Amy made.

50 (Lily's friends) + 20 = 70 (Amy's friends)

Now, to find out how many friends they have together, we add the number of friends Amy has to the number of friends Lily has:

50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120

So, Lily and Amy have 120 friends together.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Cost of Each Item:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.
   - A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs:
     \[
     \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon:
     \[
     \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Total Cost for Each Type of Item:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Dillon buys 20 peppers:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Dillon buys 10 oranges:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount of Money Dillon Will Spend:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[
\boxed{880}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Total number of patients seen each day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.

2. **Time spent with each patient:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on all patients in a day:**
   - If 500 patients each get 24 minutes, we multiply:
     \[
     500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12,000 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Convert total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     12,000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - So, the total revenue is:
     \[
     200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - So, the total cost is:
     \[
     200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     40,000 \text{ dollars} - 30,000 \text{ dollars} = 10,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Nissa hires 60 elves. Then, a third of them quit because some kids got sick on them. To find out how many quit, we divide 60 by 3:

60 Ã· 3 = 20 elves quit.

So, the number of elves left is:

60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Next, 10 more elves quit because kids kicked their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the 40 elves who were left:

40 - 10 = 30 elves.

So, the number of elves left is 30.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to count how many times Pam and Fred rode the rides.

Pam:
- Roller coaster: 2 times
- Luge: 2 times
Total for Pam: 2 + 2 = 4 rides

Fred:
- Roller coaster: 4 times
- Luge: 2 times
Total for Fred: 4 + 2 = 6 rides

Now, let's add up the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred:
Total rides: 4 (Pam) + 6 (Fred) = 10 rides

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so we need to multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride:
Total tickets used: 10 rides Ã— 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets

So, the total number of tickets they used that day is:
60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles on Tuesday.
3. The total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday:
- Monday: 4 miles
- Tuesday: 24 miles
- Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles for Monday and Tuesday from the total miles for all three days:
- Total miles for Monday to Wednesday: 41 miles
- Total miles for Monday and Tuesday: 28 miles
- Miles walked on Wednesday: \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Tom spends on car washes each month. He gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. So, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each car wash:

4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60 per month

Next, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$60 per month * 12 months = $720 per year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

Now, we know Brian has 15 video games. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we first find out what 3 times Brian's video games is:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from 45 to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Rory's order will cost.

First, we need to add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
- The subs cost $7.50 each, and she's getting 2, so that's $7.50 * 2 = $15.00.
- The chips cost $1.50 each, and she's getting 2, so that's $1.50 * 2 = $3.00.
- The cookies cost $1.00 each, and she's getting 2, so that's $1.00 * 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's add these together to get the total before the delivery fee and tip:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee:
20% of $20.00 is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00

So, the total with the delivery fee is:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many questions Mark completed in each test.

For the first test:
- Mark can do 5 questions in 1 hour.
- He had 8 hours to work on the test.
- So, he completed \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions.

The first test had 75 questions in total. So, the number of questions he didn't finish is:
\[75 - 40 = 35\]

For the second test:
- Mark can still do 5 questions in 1 hour.
- He had 6 hours to work on this test.
- So, he completed \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions.

The second test had 100 questions in total. So, the number of questions he didn't finish is:
\[100 - 30 = 70\]

Now, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:

First, we calculate four times the number of blue gumballs:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Next, we add 22 to this number to find the total number of pink gumballs:
\[ 48 + 22 = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know there are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. We need to find out how many are semi-automatic.

1. **Total cars**: 20
2. **Automatic cars**: 12
3. **Manual cars**: 4

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Next, we need to find what percentage 4 semi-automatic cars are of the total 20 cars. We do this by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. We know there are 700 bees in total.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use some simple math to find out how many worker bees there are.

First, let's say the number of queens is \( Q \).

Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

Now, we add up all the bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

To find \( Q \), divide both sides by 7:
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now we know there are 100 queens. 

The number of baby bees is:
\[ 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

The number of worker bees is:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

- Eggs: $3

The nonfood items are:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Now, let's add up the cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's add up the cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

There's a 10% tax on the nonfood items. To find the tax, we multiply the total cost of the nonfood items by 10%:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items (including tax):
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of everything is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much profit Kim will make each week from his housekeeping business.

First, we need to find out how many clients Kim will have:
- He already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 more potential clients.
- So, the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Next, we need to calculate the total expenses for these 8 clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so 2 bottles cost 2 * $2 = $4.
- Each pack of cloths costs $5.
- So, the total cost for one client is $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9.
- For 8 clients, the total expenses are 8 * $9 = $72.

Now, we need to find out the total income:
- Kim calculates that his total income each week will be $92.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total income minus the total expenses.
- So, the profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

2. Next, we need to find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. He can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year.
   \[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

3. Finally, we multiply the number of pineapples by the number of harvests to find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year.
   \[ 1000 \text{ pineapples} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**

   - Half of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the first group leave.
   - Twice 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - All the bees that left and haven't returned yet come back.
   - Bees that left in the first 6 hours and haven't returned: 30 - 15 = 15 bees.

"Okay, let's figure out who gets home faster and how long the winner will be waiting.

First, we need to know how far each of them has to go and how fast they can go.

- Steve lives 3 miles away and can bike at 440 feet per minute.
- Tim lives 2 miles away and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute.

We need to convert miles to feet because the speeds are in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's calculate how long it takes for each of them to get home.

- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

So, Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes. The winner is Steve, and he will be waiting for:

- 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service.

First, we need to count how many tires were inflated:

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, that's:
  \(5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}\)

- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, that's:
  \(3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}\)

- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, that's:
  \(1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}\)

Now, let's add up all the tires:
\(10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires}\)

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, the total cost is:
\(20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\)

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
\(500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\)

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in math class!

1. Dave ate 14 fries. So, if we start with \( x \) fries, after Dave ate, there were \( x - 14 \) fries left.

2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries. So, after the seagull, there were \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries left.

3. Then, three pigeons came and each ate 3 fries. So, the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. After the pigeons, there were \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries left.

4. A raccoon came and took two-thirds of the remaining fries. So, the raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) \) fries. This means there were \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) \) fries left after the raccoon.

5. The ants took one more fry. So, after the ants, there were \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 \) fries left.

6. We know that after all this, there were 5 fries left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

7. Let's solve this equation step by step:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = 6
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   x - 30 = 18
   \]
   Add 30 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 48
   \]

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"Okay, let's figure out how many hours Kimo spends in class each week and then for the whole semester.

First, let's look at what Kimo does each day:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes, and each class is 1 hour long. So, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes, and each class is 2 hours long. So, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.

Now, let's add up the hours for the whole week:
- For Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours}\)
- For Tuesdays and Thursdays: \(2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours}\)

So, in one week, Kimo spends \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours in class.

Now, let's find out how many hours he spends in class over the whole semester. There are 16 weeks in the semester, so:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long each type of baked good is in feet. We know:
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's convert the inches to feet:
- There are 12 inches in a foot.
- So, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.

Next, we calculate the total length for each type of baked good:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Finally, we add up all the lengths:
- Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
- Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many bananas all the apes eat in one month. 

- The monkeys eat 200 bananas.
- The gorillas eat 400 bananas.
- The baboons eat 100 bananas.

So, if we add these up:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Now, the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months. So, we need to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months. We just multiply the monthly amount by 2:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"Blake and Kelly are having a race to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They are running on a football field that is 100 yards long.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Each time he runs back and forth, he covers 100 yards there and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards. So, Blake runs:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each time she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 40 yards there and 40 yards back, which is 80 yards. So, Kelly runs:
\[ 1 \times 200 + 34 \times 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Raphael spent on his school supplies.

First, we need to find out how much he spent on the pens. He bought 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5. So, we multiply 4 by $1.5:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \]
So, he spent $6 on pens.

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the notebooks. He bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4. So, we multiply 2 by $4:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]
So, he spent $8 on notebooks.

Finally, he bought a rim of bond paper for $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \]

So, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water.
2. On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than it did on Monday. So, we add 7 feet to 17 feet:
   \[
   17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the tankâ€™s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. Let's figure out how many fish they caught in total.

First, let's see how many fish each of them caught:

**Anakin:**
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

**Locsin:**
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

**Total starfish:**
10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15

**Total sea horses:**
6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9

**Total clownfish:**
3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8

Finally, let's add up all the fish:

15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32

So, the total number of fish they caught is 32.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The bag of marbles costs $20.

2. **Price Increase:**
   - The price goes up by 20% every two months.

3. **Number of Increases:**
   - We need to find out how many times the price increases in 36 months.
   - Since the price increases every 2 months, we divide 36 by 2:
     \[
     36 \div 2 = 18
     \]
   - So, the price increases 18 times.

4. **Multiplier for Each Increase:**
   - A 20% increase means the price becomes 120% of the previous price.
   - 120% as a decimal is 1.20.

5. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - We need to multiply the initial price by 1.20, 18 times.
   - This can be written as:
     \[
     20 \times 1.20^{18}
     \]

6. **Using a Calculator:**
   - Let's use a calculator to find \(1.20^{18}\):
     \[
     1.20^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Now, multiply this by the initial price:
     \[
     20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
     \]

7. **Rounding to the Nearest Cent:**
   - The final price is approximately $766.75.

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $766.75.

"Okay, let's figure out how much all the toys are worth together.

First, we need to find out how much each type of toy costs:

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - So, the total cost for the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost 3 * $5 = $15.
   - So, the doll costs $15.

Now, we add up the costs of all the toys:
- Total cost of red cars = $20
- Total cost of action figures = $15
- Total cost of the doll = $15

So, the total value of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much money Jackie will lose if she does her taxes herself. She says she'll lose 3 hours of work, and she makes $35 for each hour. So, we multiply 3 hours by $35:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105
   \]
   So, she will lose $105 if she does her taxes herself.

2. Next, we need to know how much it costs to hire an accountant. The accountant charges $90.

3. Now, we compare the two:
   - If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105.
   - If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.

4. To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the money she would lose by doing it herself:
   \[
   105 - 90 = 15
   \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"Elvira has a budget of â‚¬1500 for her new computer and accessories. She picked out a computer that costs â‚¬1090, which includes a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also chose a scanner for â‚¬157, a CD burner for â‚¬74, and a printer for â‚¬102. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we need to add up the costs of all the items and then subtract that total from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs:
- Computer: â‚¬1090
- Scanner: â‚¬157
- CD burner: â‚¬74
- Printer: â‚¬102

Total cost of items:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \]

Now, subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1423 = 77 \]

So, Elvira will have â‚¬77 left for her clothing.

   \]

2. Now, we need to find out how many times Sandra has to babysit to get 45 eggs. Each time she babysits, she gets 9 eggs, so:
   \[
   \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs per babysitting}} = 5 \text{ times}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is \( B \) years old, then Seth is \( 2B \) years old.
2. In 2 years, Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old, and Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old.
3. The problem says that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28
   \]
   \[
   3B + 4 = 28
   \]
5. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   B = 8
   \]
7. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is:
   \[
   2B = 2 \times 8 = 16

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many miles Pancho walks on weekdays and how many miles he walks on weekends.

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks:
  \[
  20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), Pancho walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks:
  \[
  10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles}
  \]

Now, we add the miles from weekdays and weekends to get the total miles for the week:
\[
100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles}
\]

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The pants cost the average of the hat and the jacket. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket, and then divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}

So, the spiders have 640 legs in total.

Next, we need to find out how many legs all the insects have together. Each insect has 6 legs, and there are 90 insects. So, we multiply 90 by 6:
\[ 90 \times 6 = 540 \]
So, the insects have 540 legs in total.

Finally, we need to find out how many legs the rare mutant invertebrates have together. Each mutant invertebrate has 10 legs, and there are 3 of them. So, we multiply 3 by 10:

4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
- Sally Four: 8 years

First, we need to add up all the minimum payments Jessica has to make each month:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

So, the total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Next, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of $1000, we do:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]

Now, we add this 50% to the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica will pay $1500 each month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

Billy has 60 potatoes to prep for his family reunion. He needs to peel and cut each potato. 

First, let's look at the peeling:
- It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \) minutes.

Next, let's look at the cutting:
- It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \) seconds.

Now, we need to convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so \( 300 \div 60 = 5 \) minutes.

Finally, we add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

   \[
   200 = 5 \times \text{number of white carnations}
   \]
   To find the number of white carnations, we divide 200 by 5:
   \[
   \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{200}{5} = 40

   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14.
   - So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

4. **Mark's Current Age:**
   - Since two years have passed, Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

5. **Jean's Age:**

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

### Step 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 of these numbers.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Compare the Probabilities
We need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.

To find out how much more likely it is, we divide the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[
\frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

First, we need to know how many pieces of straw are given to the hamsters and the rabbits. 

- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 cages of hamsters. So, the total straw for the hamsters is:
  \[
  10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces/cage} = 50 \text{ pieces}
  \]

- The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw in total.

Now, let's add the straw for the hamsters and the rabbits:
\[
50 \text{ pieces (hamsters)} + 20 \text{ pieces (rabbits)} = 70 \text{ pieces}
\]

We know that the total straw distributed is 160 pieces. So, the straw given to the rats is:
\[
160 \text{ pieces (total)} - 70 \text{ pieces (hamsters and rabbits)} = 90 \text{ pieces (rats)}
\]

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's find out how many rats there are in total:
\[
\text{Total rats} = \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/rat}} = 15 \text{ rats}
\]

The rats are kept in 3 cages, and the number of rats in each cage is:
\[
\text{Rats per cage} = \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats/cage}
\]

So, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed on a monthly interest of 2%. This means that every month, the amount Mandy owes increases by 2%.

First, let's calculate the interest for one month:
- The interest for one month is 2% of $100.
- 2% of $100 is \( 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \) dollars.

So, after the first month, Mandy owes:
- \( 100 + 2 = 102 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the interest for the second month:
- The interest for the second month is 2% of $102.
- 2% of $102 is \( 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \) dollars.

So, after the second month, Mandy owes:
- \( 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the interest for the third month:
- The interest for the third month is 2% of $104.04.
- 2% of $104.04 is \( 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \) dollars.

So, after the third month, Mandy owes:
- \( 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \) dollars.

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

106.12"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The trader buys each bag of wheat for $20.
2. It costs $2 to transport each bag to the warehouse.
3. So, the total cost for each bag is $20 + $2 = $22.
4. The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. The profit for each bag is $30 - $22 = $8.
6. The trader made a total profit of $400.
7. To find out how many bags the trader sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the three friends spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. The tickets cost $20.25, so:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]
So, they spent $15.75 on food.

Next, we need to find out how much they spent on the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]
So, they spent $66 on the rides.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 \text{ (tickets)} + 15.75 \text{ (food)} + 66 \text{ (rides)} = 102 \]
So, the total cost is $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 102 \div 3 = 34 \]

Each of them paid:
\[ 34 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. John collects peaches for 3 hours.
2. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so in 3 hours, there are \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.
3. John can collect 2 peaches every minute. So, in 180 minutes, he can collect \(180 \times 2 = 360\) peaches.

So, John collects 360 peaches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much food one duck needs in a week. The problem says that one duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week.

Now, if we have 10 ducks, we need to multiply the amount one duck needs by 10:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much food the ducks need each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly amount by 7:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Starting Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Yearly Changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net increase in trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **After 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees That Die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final Number of Trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Friday Morning:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back in the yard.
   - So, now there are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos left.
   - And there are 6 white flamingos.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - So, the total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Difference Between Pink and White Flamingos:**
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

First, we need to find out how much one pen costs. We know that:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser together.

So, we add the cost of the pencil and the eraser:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means one pen costs $1.50.

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, 8 pens will cost:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We have 200 pounds of carrots, and we need to give 2 pounds to each of 40 restaurants.

First, we calculate how many pounds of carrots all the restaurants will get together:
2 pounds per restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount of carrots given to the restaurants from the total amount of carrots we have:
200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know the total number of people in the city of Soda is 23,786. Out of these, there are 8,417 men and 9,092 women. To find out how many children there are, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

So, we do:
23,786 (total people) - 8,417 (men) - 9,092 (women)

Let's do the math:
23,786 - 8,417 = 15,369
15,369 - 9,092 = 6,277

So, there are 6,277 children in the city of Soda.

"Okay, let's figure out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now.

1. **Initial Cards**: Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First Month**: She collected three times the number of cards she had initially. So, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. **Second Month**: She collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. So, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. **Third Month**: She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). So, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards she has:
- Initial cards: 20
- First month: 60
- Second month: 40
- Third month: 200

Total number of cards: \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\)

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now.

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and he edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers. So, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents for each sentence. So, for 500 sentences, he earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

3. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. So, Publisher B pays him 10 cents for each sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

4. To find out how much Mark makes in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:
   \[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money John made in the year after he won the award.

1. **One-time reward:**
   - John gets a one-time reward of $5000.

2. **Original weekly salary:**
   - John makes $2000 each week.

3. **Original annual salary:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, his original annual salary is $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

4. **New weekly salary with the 5% raise:**
   - A 5% raise on $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - So, his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

5. **New annual salary with the raise:**
   - His new annual salary is $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

6. **Total money made in the year:**
   - Total money = One-time reward + New annual salary
   - Total money = $5000 + $109,200 = $114,200.

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - So, for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, let's add it all up:

"Okay, let's figure out how many kilometers Micheal rode his bike in total.

First, we need to calculate how many kilometers he rode in the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 5 times 25 kilometers, which is 125 kilometers.
- For four weeks, he rides 125 kilometers times 4, which is 500 kilometers.

Next, we need to calculate how many kilometers he rode in the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 2 times 60 kilometers, which is 120 kilometers.
- For three weeks, he rides 120 kilometers times 3, which is 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
- Total kilometers = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Joe's bag of Halloween candy weighs.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Joe has 25 chocolate bars. So, we can find the total weight of the chocolate bars by multiplying the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each one:

\[ 25 \text{ chocolate bars} \times 40 \text{ grams per chocolate bar} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Joe has 80 candied apples. So, we can find the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the number of candied apples by the weight of each one:

\[ 80 \text{ candied apples} \times 20 \text{ grams per candied apple} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:

\[ 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much half a dozen plates cost. Each plate costs $6000, and half a dozen means 6 plates.

So, the total cost of half a dozen plates is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, we subtract $1200 from $36000 to find the cost of twenty dozen cups:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to figure out how many cups are in twenty dozen. Since one dozen is 12 cups, twenty dozen is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the cost of each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much Sara needs to buy the jacket and the shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, we need to add up the costs:

- Jacket: $30
- 2 pairs of shoes: 2 Ã— $20 = $40

So, the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the amount she still needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Next, let's see how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:
\[ 4 Ã— 5 = 20 \]

Adding this to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to get the remaining $40, we divide:
\[ 40 Ã· 4 = 10 \]

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to have enough money for the jacket and shoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Jerry has some red chickens and some white chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs each day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Also, Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use \( R \) for the number of red chickens and \( W \) for the number of white chickens. We know:
1. \( W = R + 2 \) (Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens)
2. \( 3R + 5W = 42 \) (The total number of eggs collected each day)

First, substitute \( W \) in the second equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Now, simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Gary walks. The park is a rectangle, and to walk around it, he covers the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, we can use this formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

The length of the park is 6 miles, and the width is 1.5 miles. So, we plug in these numbers:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks 15 miles. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, we plug in the distance and speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. We need to find out how many customers she counted on the third day. Let's call the number of customers on the third day \( x \).

We can set up the equation:
\[
100 + 150 + x = 500

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[
250 + x = 500

\[
x = 250

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We have two pools, a big one and a small one. Both pools are leaking at the same rate, 4 gallons per minute. We need to figure out how much water is in the small pool right now.

1. **What we know:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
   - Right now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

2. **Let's use some variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool right now.
   - Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool right now.

3. **Set up the equations:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (because it lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons (because it also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).

   According to the problem:
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]
   - Right now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B = 4S
     \]

4. **Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:**
   \[
   4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

5. **Simplify and solve for \( S \):**
   \[
   4S + 16 = 2S + 32
   \]
   \[
   4S - 2S = 32 - 16

   \[
   2S = 16

   \[
   S = 8

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many hours Lori has to work to earn $352.00. She earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Janeth borrowed $2000 and she has to pay back an extra 10% of that amount. 

To find 10% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, Janeth is going to pay $165 each month for 12 months. To find out how much she will pay in total over 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she still owes after paying $1980. We subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay back:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]

220"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 4 roses in the vase. The problem says there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, if we have 4 roses, we add 7 to find out how many dahlias there are:

4 roses + 7 = 11 dahlias

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias together:

4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet. So, Adrian is:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. So, Zack is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, let's find out how old they will be in three years:
1. Harriet will be:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]
2. Adrian will be:
   \[
   63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Zack will be:
   \[
   42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:
\[
45

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Naomi's Score**: We know Naomi scored 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. Half of 68 is 34, and 10 more than 34 is 44. So, Yuri scored 44 points.
3. **Brianna's Score**: Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17, which is 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

Total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from 251:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

54"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much time Carmen spent on the crossword puzzles. She solved 3 crossword puzzles, and each one takes her 10 minutes. So, we multiply the number of puzzles by the time it takes for each one:

3 puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 30 minutes

Next, we need to find out how much time she spent on the sudoku puzzles. She solved 8 sudoku puzzles, and each one takes her 5 minutes. So, we multiply the number of puzzles by the time it takes for each one:

8 puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 40 minutes

Now, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles to get the total time:

30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

70"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we start with 120 liters of water in the tank. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden. So, we need to subtract 90 liters from 120 liters to find out how much water is left in the tank.

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

So, 30 liters of water are left in the tank.

Next, Celine collects rainwater. She collects twice as much as what is left in the tank. Since 30 liters are left, she collects:

2 Ã— 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the 60 liters of rainwater to the 30 liters that were already in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the total amount of water in the tank now is:

90 liters"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. That's a lot of flowers!

Next, the problem says he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, we need to subtract 40 from the number of geraniums to find out how many petunias he plants:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of flowers Andy plants. We add the number of geraniums and the number of petunias:
\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140.

140"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the company spends $15,000 on advertising for one year. That's a big number, but we can handle it!

Next, for the second year, they spend a third of that amount. To find a third of $15,000, we divide $15,000 by 3:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, they spend $5,000 on advertising for the second year.

Now, to find the total amount spent over the two years, we add the amounts together:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000.

20000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much Carlos pays for the canoe. The canoe costs $30 per hour, and Carlos uses it for 3 hours. So, we multiply 30 by 3:

So, Carlos pays $90.

Next, we need to find out how much Benji pays for the banana boat raft. The raft costs $18 per hour, and Benji uses it for 5 hours. So, we multiply 18 by 5:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]
So, Benji pays $90.

Now, we add the amounts that Carlos and Benji pay to find the total cost:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - It takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - So, if it takes 6 days by bus, it will take \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days by car.

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - To go to Rochester by bus, it takes 6 days.
   - To return from Rochester by car, it takes 3 days.
   - So, the total travel time is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) days.

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many Pokemon cards James has in total at the start:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

So, the total number of cards is:
\[ 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 \]

Next, we need to account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards, so he now has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \] water type cards
- James buys 14 more grass type cards, so he now has:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \] grass type cards

Now, let's find the new total number of cards:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer:
\[ 33\% \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
33%"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Chad still owes for his burrito.

First, we need to add up all the costs:

- The base burrito costs $6.50.
- Extra meat costs $2.00.
- Extra cheese costs $1.00.
- Avocado costs $1.00.
- Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so that's $0.25 + $0.25 = $0.50.
- The meal upgrade with chips and a drink costs $3.00.

Now, let's add all these together:

\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

So, the total cost of the burrito and the meal upgrade is $14.00.

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00. We need to subtract this from the total cost:

\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Kalinda's Rate:**
   - Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Mom's Rate:**
   - Kalinda's mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda.
   - So, her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

3. **Combined Rate:**
   - Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

4. **Total Pieces:**
   - The puzzle has 360 pieces.

5. **Time to Complete the Puzzle:**
   - To find out how long it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate.
   - Time = \( \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

6. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, the farm had 120 baby watermelons. When Ashlyn went to the farm after two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested. 

To find out how many watermelons were ready, we calculate 30% of 120:
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home. Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

Two weeks later, Ashlyn went back to the farm. This time, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready to be harvested. 

To find out how many watermelons were ready this time, we calculate 3/4 of 84:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

So, Ashlyn took 63 more watermelons home. Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were still not ready:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons} \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to find out how much Mark pays for the cars. Each car costs $20,000, and he buys 12 cars. So, we multiply:

\[ 20,000 \times 12 = 240,000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the tax. The tax is 10% of the total cost of the cars. To find 10% of 240,000, we multiply:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Then, we need to add the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and he buys 12 cars. So, we multiply:

\[ 1,000 \times 12 = 12,000 \]

Now, we add up all the costs: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

   So, 12 penguins jump in and swim.
3. Another one-third of them go inside the cave to eat their dinner. Again, we need to find one-third of 36:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12

   So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.
4. Now, we add the number of penguins that left for both activities:
   \[
   12 + 12 = 24
   \]
5. Finally, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins:

1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes every day.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so Steve eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) tomatoes in a week.
3. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats \(42 \div 2 = 21\) tomatoes in a week.
4. Together, they eat \(42 + 21 = 63\) tomatoes in a week.
5. Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.
6. To find out how many vines are needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce: \(63 \div 3 = 21\).

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Batch of New Pens**: When he uses up these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from 25 empty pens, he can make 5 new pens.
3. **Second Batch of New Pens**: After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens. From these 5 empty pens, he can make 1 more new pen.
4. **Final Count**: Now, he has used all the pens he made, and he has 1 empty pen left, but he can't make another new pen because he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, let's add up all the pens he used:
- 25 initial pens
- 5 new pens from the first batch
- 1 new pen from the second batch

25 + 5 + 1 = 31

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is 31.

First, we know there were 1000 students in the school hall. 

1. **Exit A**: 30% of the students left through Exit A. 
   - 30% of 1000 is 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.
   - So, 300 students left through Exit A.

2. **Remaining Students**: After 300 students left through Exit A, we need to find out how many students are left.
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students are still in the hall.

3. **Exit B**: 3/5 of the remaining students left through Exit B.
   - 3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.
   - So, 420 students left through Exit B.

4. **Exit C**: The rest of the students left through Exit C.
   - We need to find out how many students are left after Exit A and Exit B.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that John has 54 candies. The problem also tells us that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, if we divide John's candies by 2, we can find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, if we add 6 to Robert's candies, we can find out how many candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has compared to James. We do this by subtracting the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

1. **Find out how many pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - So, he still has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. **Calculate how many letters Mike receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - So, he receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters each week.

3. **Determine how many pages Mike needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - So, he needs to write \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages each week.

4. **Calculate how long it takes Mike to write these pages:**
   - Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes.
   - So, it takes him \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes to write all the pages.

5. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We have two aquariums. One has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. We need to find out how many fish are in each aquarium, and we know that both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem says that this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium, then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

Now, we can set up the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

\[ 70 + 4 = 74 \]
\[ 74 + 22 = 96 \]

So, the total amount spent is $96.

Now, Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents. That means three people are sharing the cost. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent $300.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday:**
   - Her sister ate 5 cookies.
   - Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister.
   - So, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.

2. **Find out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday:**
   - Her sister ate 13 cookies.
   - Sue ate 2 times as many as her sister.
   - So, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies each person ate:**
   - Sue's total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.
   - Her sister's total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.

4. **Convert the number of cookies to calories:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.
   - Her sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

5. **Find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:**
   - Difference in calories: \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many students are in the whole school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes:
   \[
   20 \text{ students/class} \times 3 \text{ classes} = 60 \text{ students}
   \]

2. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so half of the students are boys and half are girls:
   \[
   \text{Total number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of boys} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. Now, let's find out how many girls are in the third class. We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls:
   \[
   \text{Total girls in the first and second classes} = 15 + 12 = 27
   \]

4. Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the third class} = 30 - 27 = 3
   \]

5. Each class has 20 students, so the number of boys in the third class is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in the third class} = 20 - 3 = 17
   \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is:
17"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Travis started with 61 apps on his tablet. He deleted 9 apps, so we need to subtract 9 from 61. That gives us:

61 - 9 = 52 apps

Then, Travis downloaded 18 more apps. So, we need to add 18 to the 52 apps he had left. That gives us:

52 + 18 = 70 apps

So, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet.

70"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Last night:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today:**
   - Rick killed 3 fewer cougars than last night.
     \[
     15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars}
     \]
   - Rick killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars today.
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves}
     \]

3. **Total animals killed today:**
   \[
   36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48 \text{ animals}
   \]

4. **Total animals killed over both nights:**
   \[
   10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} + 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 73 \text{ animals}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Bill starts on the 3rd floor. The problem says he goes up to a floor that is 4 times his starting floor plus 6. 

First, we need to find out what 4 times his starting floor is:
4 * 3 = 12

Next, we add 6 to that number:
12 + 6 = 18

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

18"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. 

Next, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times that is, we need to calculate 30% of 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \] times.

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

84"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know there are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows. So, the total number of cows in all the stalls is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall originally had 20 cows, and with the new cows, each stall has:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 176 \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank. We need to add up the value of all the coins and dollar bills.

1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 1 penny is worth $0.01, 100 pennies are worth:
   \[
   100 \times 0.01 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Since 1 nickel is worth $0.05, 40 nickels are worth:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Brady has 20 dimes. Since 1 dime is worth $0.10, 20 dimes are worth:
   \[
   20 \times 0.10 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Dollar bills**: Brady has 40 dollar bills. Since each dollar bill is worth $1, 40 dollar bills are worth:
   \[
   40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[
1 + 2 + 2 + 40 = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Brady has 45 dollars in his piggy bank.

45"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot tree. We do this by dividing 200 by 10:
   \[
   200 \div 10 = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. So, to find the total weight of the tree, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:
   \[
   20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. To find out how much weight that is, we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds:
   \[
   0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Finally, to find the weight of the tree after the termites ate some of it, we subtract the weight of the wood they ate from the total weight:
   \[
   8000 - 2400 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of its wood is:

\[
5600

"Okay, let's figure out how much Nancy has to pay for her overdue books.

First, we need to find out how much she owes for the 8 books. Each book costs 50 cents to return late. So, we multiply 8 books by 50 cents:

8 books * 50 cents/book = 400 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, 400 cents is the same as $4.00.

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

Nancy has to pay $6.00 in total.

6.00"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're working through a math problem in class.

First, we know that Andrea has 52 apples. The problem says Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, if we let \( J \) be the number of apples Jamal has, we can write:

\[ 52 = J + 8 \]

To find out how many apples Jamal has, we subtract 8 from 52:

\[ J = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J = 44 \]

So, Jamal has 44 apples.

Next, the problem tells us that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. If \( B \) is the number of bananas Jamal has, we can write:

\[ B = 44 + 4 \]
\[ B = 48 \]

So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, the problem also says that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, if \( A_b \) is the number of bananas Andrea has, we can write:

\[ A_b = \frac{48}{2} \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

Finally, we need to find the total number of fruits. We add up all the apples and bananas:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 \text{ (Andrea's apples)} + 24 \text{ (Andrea's bananas)} + 44 \text{ (Jamal's apples)} + 48 \text{ (Jamal's bananas)} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 168.

168"
"To figure out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to know how many cookies she's making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, we add those together:

36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour make 12 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we first see how many sets of 12 cookies are in 66:

66 Ã· 12 = 5.5 sets of 12 cookies

Since each set of 12 cookies needs 2 cups of flour, we multiply the number of sets by 2:

5.5 Ã— 2 = 11 cups of flour

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake all the cookies.

"To figure out how much money is in the stack, we need to do a couple of steps. First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two-thirds of the cup. Then, we need to turn that number of pennies into dollars.

1. **Find two-thirds of 9,300 pennies:**
   - We can do this by multiplying 9,300 by 2 and then dividing by 3.
   - \( 9,300 \times 2 = 18,600 \)
   - \( 18,600 \div 3 = 6,200 \)
   - So, two-thirds of 9,300 pennies is 6,200 pennies.

2. **Convert 6,200 pennies to dollars:**
   - Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6,200 by 100.
   - \( 6,200 \div 100 = 62 \)
   - So, 6,200 pennies is 62 dollars.

The total dollar amount in the stack is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Maddison has 5 boxes, and each box has 50 marbles. So, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box:

5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Then, Maddison gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, we add those 20 marbles to the 250 marbles she already has:

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

So, Maddison has 270 marbles now.

270"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Chris has 6 trees in his yard.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. So, Ferdinand has:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Mrs. Cruz has a budget of $400,000 for a house. She found a house that costs $350,000. But there are extra fees she needs to pay: a brokerage fee and a transfer fee.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - 5% of $350,000 is \( 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \).

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   - The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   - 12% of $350,000 is \( 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   - The total cost is the selling price plus the brokerage fee plus the transfer fee.
   - Total cost = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

4. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   - The difference between the total cost and the budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees and also pay off the remaining loan on the house. We need to figure out how much money he has left after all these expenses.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   - The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   - So, 3% of $400,000 is \( 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \).

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - So, 5% of $400,000 is \( 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \).

3. **Add the remaining loan amount:**
   - The remaining loan amount is $250,000.

4. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   - Total expenses = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

5. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses
   - Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.
   - First, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes:
     \[
     0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - So, it takes 8 minutes longer to heat from 300 to 400 degrees.
   - Total time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees:
     \[
     20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the real estate agent spent on the newspaper ads:
- Each newspaper ad costs $5.
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
- So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much the agent spent on the television ads:
- Each television ad costs $75.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.
- So, the total cost for the television ads is \( 75 \times 15 = 1125 \) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = \( 250 + 1125 = 1375 \) dollars.

So, the real estate agent spent a total of 1375 dollars on buying all the ads.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. So, we add 12 to 300:
   \[
   300 + 12 = 312
   \]
   The second bag has 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. We divide 300 by 2:
   \[
   300 \div 2 = 150
   \]
   The third bag has 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add up all the M&Ms from the three bags:
\[

2. Next, we need to add the extra windows in one house.
   - Each house has 4 additional windows.
   - So, the total number of windows in one house is \(6 + 4 = 10\).

3. Since John has 2 houses, we need to double the number of windows in one house.
   - The total number of windows in both houses is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches. So, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. So, the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Mrs. Rylan spent on the seeds.

First, we need to find out how much she spent on the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is \( 20 \times 40 = 800 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is \( 80 \times 30 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total amount spent: \( 800 + 2400 = 3200 \) dollars

So, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

"Okay, let's figure out how many lines Sean has to memorize for his theater role. We need to add up the lines from his song and the lines from the two scenes.

1. **Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice as many lines as the song.
   - So, \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines in the first scene.
   - But only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines are Sean's in the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has 6 more lines than the song.
   - So, \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines in the second scene.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines are Sean's in the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines Sean has to memorize:

2. **Remaining cards after A:**
   - Total cards: 80
   - Cards with A: 32
   - Remaining cards: \( 80 - 32 = 48 \)

3. **Cards with B:**
   - 1/2 of the remaining cards have the letter B.
   - So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \) cards have the letter B.

4. **Remaining cards after B:**

First, we need to find out how long it takes Matthew to dig all the small holes. He takes 3 minutes for each small hole, and he needs to dig 30 small holes. So, we multiply 3 minutes by 30:

3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to dig all the large holes. He takes 10 minutes for each large hole, and he needs to dig 15 large holes. So, we multiply 10 minutes by 15:

10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes to get the total time:

90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 240 minutes by 60:

240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 right now. In 10 years, both of them will be 10 years older. So, we need to add 10 years to each of their ages.

If we add 10 years to both of their ages, that's 10 + 10 = 20 more years in total.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
20 (current sum) + 20 (10 years for each) = 40

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we're doing it in math class!

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Ruby is 6 times older than Sam right now.
   - In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Let's say Sam's current age is \( S \).
   - Then Ruby's current age is \( 6S \) because she is 6 times older than Sam.

3. **Write the Equation for 9 Years Later:**
   - In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
   - In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).
   - According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
     \[
     6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - First, expand the right side of the equation:
     \[
     6S + 9 = 3S + 27
     \]
   - Next, subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to get all the \( S \) terms on one side:
     \[
     6S - 3S + 9 = 27
     \]
     \[
     3S + 9 = 27
     \]
   - Then, subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the \( 3S \) term:
     \[
     3S = 18
     \]
   - Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( S \):
     \[
     S = 6
     \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Peter spent on the popsicles. He bought 20 popsicles, and each one costs $0.25. So, we multiply 20 by $0.25:
20 * $0.25 = $5.00

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the ice cream bars. He bought 4 ice cream bars, and each one costs $0.50. So, we multiply 4 by $0.50:
4 * $0.50 = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter spent:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots. The problem says that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, if a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba must have half of that:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we need to find out how many spots all the cobras and mambas have together. There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. So, the total number of spots for all the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. So, the total number of spots for all the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the spots from the cobras and the mambas to get the total number of spots:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

The problem asks for half the number of spots they all have combined. So, we divide the total number of spots by 2:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final answer is:

2450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many people are coming to the soccer game.
   - There are 12 team members.
   - Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.
   - There are also 3 coaches.
   - So, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

2. Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas we need.
   - Each pizza can serve 3 people.
   - To find out how many pizzas we need, we divide the total number of people by 3: \(39 \div 3 = 13\).

3. Finally, we need to calculate the total cost.
   - Each pizza costs $15.
   - So, the total cost is \(13 \times 15 = 195\).

Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Topaz Gemstones:**
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones.
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

2. **Total Length of the Necklace:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.

3. **Remaining Length for Sterling Silver Beads:**
   - The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

4. **Sterling Silver Beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
   - To find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 0.25 (which is the same as multiplying by 4):
   - \( 17 \div 0.25 = 17 \times 4 = 68 \).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many stories each person wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, they each wrote double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each person:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up all the stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot:
\[ 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 \]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much money Kelly has. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
  5 * 25 = 125 cents

- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
  2 * 10 = 20 cents

Now, let's add these together to find out how much money Kelly has in total:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many stars are in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. So, we need to subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total to find out how many stars are left for the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row has 5 stars. To find out how many 5-star rows there are, we divide the remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

Now, we know the trucks can carry 2000 pounds each. To find out how many trucks we need, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ 6000 \div 2000 = 3 \]

So, we need 3 trucks to transport all 80 flagstones in one trip.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. The car in the fast lane is going 60 miles per hour.
2. The car in the slow lane is going half that speed, so it's going 30 miles per hour.
3. The car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles.

To find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} \]

Now, let's do the math:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480}{30} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**
   - Ali and Izzy together have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out.
   - This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, we multiply 8 by 5:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
So, there are 40 chocolate bars in total.

Next, we need to see how many chocolate bars the adults get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, we multiply 4 by 6:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]
So, the adults get 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]
So, there are 16 chocolate bars left for the children.

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. So, we divide 16 by 8:
\[ 16 \div 8 = 2 \]
So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has more than 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has more than 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Will buys 15 oranges. He has two sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest is 4 years old.

The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges. The youngest son also washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

So, together, they wash:
8 oranges (oldest son) + 4 oranges (youngest son) = 12 oranges

Will bought 15 oranges in total. After the sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
15 oranges - 12 oranges = 3 oranges

So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up all the exercises he did over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much rice each person eats in one meal. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.

2. Since there are 5 people in the household, we multiply the amount of rice one person eats by the number of people:
   \[
   0.2 \text{ kg/person} \times 5 \text{ people} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]

3. Each person eats rice twice a day, so we need to find out how much rice the household eats in one day:
   \[
   1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

4. Now, we need to find out how much rice the household eats in one week. There are 7 days in a week:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

5. Finally, we need to find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We divide the total amount of rice by the amount of rice consumed per week:

"Okay, let's figure out how much John pays for his driving service each year.

First, we need to find out how many miles John travels in a year. He goes to work and back, which is 30 miles each way, so that's 60 miles a day. He works 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles a week. He works 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles a year.

Next, we need to find out how much he pays for these miles. The driving service charges $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, he pays 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a bonus of $150 each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Now, we add the cost of the miles and the bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year:
$30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

So, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

1. **Total Books and Unsold Books:**
   - Elise's Dad had 250 books.
   - There are 50 unsold books left.
   - So, the number of books sold so far is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \) books.

2. **Books Sold in the Current Year:**
   - This year, Elise sold 45 books.

3. **Books Sold in the First Year:**
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year.
   - So, in the first year, she sold \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \) books.

4. **Books Sold in the Second Year:**
   - We know the total books sold over the three years is 200.
   - Books sold in the first year: 90
   - Books sold in the current year: 45
   - Books sold in the second year: \( 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 \) books.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - There are about 4 weeks in a month, so he works \(4 \times 5 = 20\) days in April.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - So, each day he earns \(10 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 100 \text{ dollars}\).
   - For 20 days, he earns \(20 \text{ days} \times 100 \text{ dollars/day} = 2000 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - So, his total bonus for April is \(4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2000.
   - Total bonus: $1200.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beats 16 people. Now, to find out how many people he loses to, we subtract the number of people he beats from the total number of people he arm wrestles:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, the bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of these loaves. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we do this:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

Next, we need to figure out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[ \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Now, half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves left:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

These 10 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. So, we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks to find out how much he loses each week:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we know that Joey loses 2 pounds in one week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. So, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Next, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set up a simple multiplication to find out how many 4-week periods it will take for her to lose 8 pounds:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \div 2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks} = 4 \text{ periods of 4 weeks} \]

So, Sandy will need:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

   - If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

2. **Milk Savings:**
   - The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.
   - If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Helena's serum makes a person grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. We need to find out how many new limbs a person will have after 15 days.

1. **New Arms:**
   - Every 3 days, a person grows 1 new arm.
   - In 15 days, we can divide 15 by 3 to find out how many new arms grow.
   - \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
   - So, 5 new arms will grow in 15 days.

2. **New Legs:**
   - Every 5 days, a person grows 1 new leg.
   - In 15 days, we can divide 15 by 5 to find out how many new legs grow.
   - \( 15 \div 5 = 3 \)
   - So, 3 new legs will grow in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of new arms and new legs.
   - \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)

So, after 15 days, a person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out how much Theo spends on the business suits:
- He buys 6 suits at $100 each.
- So, 6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
- He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- So, 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, let's find out how much the flight ticket costs:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- The cost of one business suit is $100.
- So, 5 * $100 = $500
- Then, $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the expenses so far:
- Suits: $600
- Suitcases: $150
- Flight ticket: $1200
- Total expenses: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, we need to figure out how much he has left to spend after saving and paying for the other items:
- Total money: $6000
- Money to save: $2000
- Money left after saving: $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, subtract the total expenses from the money left after saving:
- Money left after expenses: $4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"Okay, let's figure out how many eggs the family eats in a week.

First, we need to know how many eggs they eat each day:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day. So, \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- Two people eat 2 eggs each day. So, \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, we add the eggs together to find the total for one day:
- \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
- \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

So, the family will eat 91 eggs in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Cera's Age:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, he is now 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - If the population six years ago was 60,000, then the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

So, the current population of Chile is 120,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

We know that the football team has 105 members in total. We also know that:
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.
- There are half as many players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's use \( D \) to represent the number of players on the defense. Then:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

Now, we can set up an equation to find \( D \):

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

First, let's combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier to solve, we can get rid of the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

\[ 2 \times 3D + 2 \times \frac{D}{2} = 2 \times 105 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

Now, combine the \( D \) terms:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

To find \( D \), divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"Okay, let's figure out how many people are coming to Martha's Christmas party.

First, we need to find out how many people Martha invited:
- She invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people can't come:
- 8 people couldn't come because they were sick.
- 1/4 of the number of sick people had other commitments: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people

So, the total number of people who can't come is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

Now, we subtract the number of people who can't come from the total number of people invited:
\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.
2. He already had 50 marbles in his store.
3. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.

First, let's find out how many marbles his father gave him:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's add all the marbles together:
\[ 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (initially in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

"To figure out how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to find out how much space the pool takes up, which is called the volume. The volume of the pool is found by multiplying the length, width, and depth.

The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. So, we multiply these numbers together:

6 feet Ã— 4 feet Ã— 5 feet = 120 cubic feet

This means the pool can hold 120 cubic feet of water. It costs $0.1 for each cubic foot of water. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

120 cubic feet Ã— $0.1 per cubic foot = $12

So, it costs $12 to fill the pool.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem tells us there are 30 boys in the classroom.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 30

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem says there are 3 times as many girls as boys. So, we multiply the number of boys by 3.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem also says there are \(\frac{1}{10}\) as many nongendered children as boys. So, we divide the number of boys by 10.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{30}{10} = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that for every electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. This is like saying if you have 1 pole, you need 3 wires.

Now, we are told that there are 45 electric wires in total. We need to find out how many electric poles are needed.

To do this, we can set up a simple equation. If 1 pole needs 3 wires, then the number of poles (let's call it \( P \)) times 3 should equal the total number of wires, which is 45.

So, we write it like this:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Total number of people at the start:**
   - There were 25 men and 15 women.
   - So, the total number of people was 25 + 15 = 40.

2. **Number of people who left:**
   - After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 is 40 Ã· 4 = 10 people left.

3. **Number of people remaining:**
   - If 10 people left, then 40 - 10 = 30 people stayed.

4. **Number of men remaining:**
   - We know that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Number of women remaining:**
   - If 30 people stayed and 22 of them are men, then the number of women who stayed is 30 - 22 = 8.

So, the number of women left is 8.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that the book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so we divide the cost of the book by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:
\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

So, the pen costs $1.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and all together, she has 26 pencils. We need to find out how many pencils are in each box.

1. Let's set up an equation to find out how many pencils are in each box:
   \[
   3 \times \text{pencils per box} + 2 = 26
   \]

2. Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with the number of pencils per box:
   \[
   3 \times \text{pencils per box} = 24
   \]

3. Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for the number of pencils per box:
   \[
   \text{pencils per box} = 8
   \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and her sister, Meg, have together.

1. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Add these together to get the total number of pencils:
   \[
   26 + 46 = 72
   \]

2. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
   \[
   \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Cooling the Coffee:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes she needs, we divide 65 by 13:
     \[
     \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening the Coffee:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Since she uses 5 ice cubes, the coffee gets:
     \[
     5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Adding Cream:**
   - Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which makes the coffee even weaker.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - To find the total weakening, we add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

So, Shannonâ€™s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - Junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total employees.
   - So, the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Find the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - If there are 40 junior programmers, then the number of senior programmers is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

3. **Find the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - So, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is \( 2000 + 400 = 2400 \).

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:**
   - There are 40 junior programmers.
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - So, the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is \( 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \).

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:**
   - There are 60 senior programmers.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $2400 per month.
   - So, the total monthly salary for all senior programmers is \( 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \).

6. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all programmers:**
   - The total monthly salary for all programmers is the sum of the total monthly salaries for junior and senior programmers.
   - So, the total monthly salary for all programmers is \( 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \).

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

1. We start with some people getting on the bus at the terminal. Let's call this number \( x \).
2. At the first stop, 5 more people get on the bus. So now, the total number of people on the bus is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second stop, 7 people get off the bus, and 8 more people get on. So, we subtract 7 and add 8 to the number of people on the bus. This gives us \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Let's simplify that:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

4. We know that after the second stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So, we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

5. To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

- The state takes 20% in taxes.
- The tax he pays is \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars.
- After taxes, he has \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars left.

**Job B:**
- Nick gets paid $42,000 a year.
- He has to pay $6,000 in property tax.
- After property tax, he has \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars left.
- The state takes 10% in taxes on the remaining amount.
- The tax he pays is \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars.
- After taxes, he has \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars left.

Now, let's see how much more money Nick will have with Job B compared to Job A:
- Job B net pay: $32,400
- Job A net pay: $24,000

First, let's look at Furniture United's offer:
- They want $1,350 upfront.
- Then, you have to pay $350 every month for 6 months.
- So, the total for the monthly payments is $350 times 6, which is $2,100.
- Adding the upfront payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Now, let's check Cozy Homes' offer:
- They want $1,100 upfront.
- Then, you have to pay $250 every month for 9 months.
- So, the total for the monthly payments is $250 times 9, which is $2,250.
- Adding the upfront payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

To find the cost difference:
- We subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes from the total cost of Furniture United.

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of these groups:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. We need to find out how many legs all the animals have together.

1. Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
2. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solve for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. So, there are 20 cows. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, there are:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ chickens}
   \]

Now, let's count the legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have:
  \[
  20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ legs}
  \]
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have:
  \[
  40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ legs}
  \]

Add the legs together:
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, she got twice as many new baby outfits as her friend gave her. So, that's \(2 \times 24 = 48\) baby outfits.
3. Her mom gave her 15 more baby outfits.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[ 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 \]

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
2. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more meters each day. So, we need to find out what 1/5 of 5000 meters is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
   \]
3. Now, we add this extra 1000 meters to the 5000 meters he already runs:
   \[
   5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
   \]
4. June has 30 days, so we need to find out how many meters he runs in total for the whole month:
   \[
   6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
   \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
180000 meters"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.

Next, Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, we add 5 dollars to the cost of Juice Box A:
4 dollars + 5 dollars = 9 dollars.

Then, Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, we add 7 dollars to the cost of Juice Box A:
4 dollars + 7 dollars = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:
11 dollars - 9 dollars = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many legs the 40 tables with 4 legs each have:
- Each table has 4 legs.
- So, 40 tables times 4 legs per table is:
  \[
  40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how many legs the 50 tables with 3 legs each have:
- Each table has 3 legs.
- So, 50 tables times 3 legs per table is:
  \[
  50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs}
  \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables to get the total number of legs:
- 160 legs from the 4-legged tables plus 150 legs from the 3-legged tables is:
  \[
  160 + 150 = 310 \text{ legs}
  \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Total cookies in the bag**: 36 cookies.
2. **Cookies for her son's lunch**: 4 cookies each day for 5 days a week.
   - 4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week.
3. **Cookies for her husband**: 1 cookie each day for 7 days a week.
   - 1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week.

Now, let's add up the cookies eaten by her son and her husband:
- 20 cookies (son) + 7 cookies (husband) = 27 cookies.

Finally, we subtract the total cookies eaten by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:
- 36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies.

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much the shirts cost without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
   - So, the total cost without the discount is: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) dollars.

2. Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 40% off the total cost.
   - To find 40% of $60, we multiply 60 by 0.40 (which is the same as 40%):
   - \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \) dollars.

3. Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Davos paid.
   - So, the amount Davos paid is: \( 60 - 24 = 36 \) dollars.

Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **First, let's find out how much money the factory used to make each day when they made tractors:**
   - They sold 10 tractors a day.
   - Each tractor was sold for $100.
   - So, the total money they made each day from tractors is \( 10 \times 100 = 1000 \) dollars.

2. **Now, let's find out how much money the factory makes each day when they make silos:**
   - They sell 5 silos a day.
   - Each silo is sold for $220.
   - So, the total money they make each day from silos is \( 5 \times 220 = 1100 \) dollars.

3. **Next, we need to find out how much more money they are making now:**
   - The difference in daily earnings is \( 1100 - 1000 = 100 \) dollars.

4. **Finally, we need to find out what percentage this increase is of the original daily earnings:**
   - The percentage increase is calculated by dividing the increase by the original amount and then multiplying by 100.
   - So, the percentage increase is \( \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \).

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

2. **Treats:**
   - Treats cost $20 every month.

3. **Medicine:**
   - Medicine costs $100 every month.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Add up the costs: $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.

   30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ plant pots}
   \]

2. Next, we add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to get the total number of plant pots needed:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ plant pots}
   \]

3. April already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much time John spent on all the activities he did. He spent 6 hours boating, 3 hours swimming (which is half the time he spent boating), and 6 hours watching shows (since he watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long).

So, the total time for these activities is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours (boating)} + 3 \text{ hours (swimming)} + 6 \text{ hours (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

The problem says that these 15 hours are 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. We can set up a simple equation to find the total time \( T \):
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know that John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. To find out how much time he spent sightseeing, we calculate 40% of 50 hours:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much money Annabelle has already. She has $80 in her savings.

Next, let's see how much she earns from her first job. She works 20 hours and earns $10 per hour. So, she earns:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from her second job. She works 15 hours and earns $5 per hour. So, she earns:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money she has:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars (savings)} + 200 \text{ dollars (first job)} + 75 \text{ dollars (second job)} = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. So, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:

   \]
3. Now, we add the heights of the shortest and the second tree to find their combined height:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so:
   \[
   2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet}

Next, he bought 5 teddy bears, and each one costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
5 * 1 = $5

Now, we add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent:
12 + 5 = $17

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
28 - 17 = $11

3. Ride the go-karts twice, which costs $10 per ride.

First, let's find out how much it costs for one person to do all these things:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 x 2 = $20

So, the total cost for one person is:
$5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, Morgan has $90 to spend. We need to see how many people can be included in this budget:
$90 Ã· $30 = 3

100 cents = $1.00

So, Marisa spends $1.00 on lollipops each day.

Now, let's see how much money she has left each day after buying the lollipops:
$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

Marisa saves $4.00 each day. She saves for 5 days, so we need to find out how much she saves in total over those 5 days:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

First, we need to get rid of the -5 on the right side. We do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we need to find out what \( x \) is. We do this by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, we need to find the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
   - Then, it goes 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
   - Finally, it goes 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs to get back to the first city.

   So, let's add the first two distances:
   \[
   75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles}
   \]

   Now, the distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles:
   \[
   175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
   \]

   Therefore, the total distance for one complete trip is:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Next, we need to find the total distance the train travels in one day:**
   - The train makes 3 trips each day.
   - So, the total distance per day is:
   \[
   300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Finally, we need to determine how many days the train can go before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   - To find out how many days it can go before needing service, we divide the total service distance by the distance traveled per day:
   \[
   \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}

- A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed needs the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

To find the average for the collie bed:
- Add the amounts for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds: 8 + 2 = 10 pounds.
- Divide by 2 to get the average: 10 Ã· 2 = 5 pounds.

So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing for the beds Mark wants to make:
- For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 Ã— 2 = 8 pounds.
- For 3 collie beds: 3 Ã— 5 = 15 pounds.

Now, add the amounts together to get the total:

First, we need to calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house. He had to drive 200 miles, but he took a detour that added 10 more miles, so he drove 210 miles in total. He was driving at 70 miles per hour. 

To find the time, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, for the first part of the trip:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for John to drive back home. The route home was 240 miles, and he drove at 80 miles per hour.

For the second part of the trip:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the times for both parts of the trip:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is 6 hours.

Then, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add up the people kicked out for not wearing masks, shoplifting, and physical violence:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

   - So, the total cost for the picture frames is \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Etching:**
   - Each picture frame needs to be etched, which adds 20% to the cost.
   - 20% of $20 is \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - So, the additional cost for etching all the frames is \( 44 \times 4 = 176 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will also receive pins.
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the pins is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - 1/4 of 44 is \( 44 \div 4 = 11 \) seniors.

\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80 by making the wallpaper himself.

Next, we need to find out how much it costs him to make the wallpaper. We subtract the savings from the market price:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: They sold double the number of pairs they sold on Friday. So, \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: They sold half the number of pairs they sold on Saturday. So, \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. But, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, the store actually sold \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) shoes.

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 100.

100"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On Tuesdays, Hallie practices for 1 hour.
2. On Thursdays, she practices for 2 hours.
3. On Saturdays, she practices for twice as long as on Tuesdays. Since she practices for 1 hour on Tuesdays, on Saturdays she practices for 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours:
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours

So, the total number of hours she practices each week is:
1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice each week.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The company bought equipment worth $400,000.
2. 40% of the equipment was faulty. To find out how much the faulty equipment is worth, we need to calculate 40% of $400,000.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

So, the faulty equipment is worth $160,000.

3. To find out how much the functioning equipment is worth, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value of the equipment.

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ 240,000 \]

240000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them give her 1 kg of milk each day, and the other half give her 2 kg of milk each day.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is 15 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the milk from each group:
- The first group of 15 sheep gives 1 kg of milk each, so:
  15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk
- The second group of 15 sheep gives 2 kg of milk each, so:
  15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk

Finally, let's add the milk from both groups to find the total:
- Total milk = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 40 pupils in the class.
2. Half of the class likes blue. So, we need to find half of 40:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   So, 20 pupils like blue.
3. Now, we need to find out how many pupils are left after those who like blue:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 pupils are left.
4. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we need to find one-fourth of 20:
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   So, 5 pupils like green.
5. Finally, we need to find out how many pupils like yellow. We subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:
   \[
   40 - 20 - 5 = 15
   \]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Monday:**
   - Lucy made $56 from selling apples.
   - Each apple costs $4.
   - To find out how many apples she sold, we divide the total money by the price per apple: 
     \[
     \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ apples}
     \]
   - So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - So, she picked:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
     \]

Now, let's add up all the apples she picked over the three days:
\[
14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples}
\]

So, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Lindsay has 50 socks that need washing. She washes 10 pairs of socks. Since 1 pair is 2 socks, 10 pairs are 10 * 2 = 20 socks. She also washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washes is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks. That's 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

65 - 44 = 21 cookies

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

21"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Karan has to pay each month. 

First, we need to find out how much interest Karan will pay. The interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (the amount borrowed) is $3,650, the rate is 10% (which is 0.10 as a decimal), and the time is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

So, the interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

Let's do the math step by step:

1. Calculate \(0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}\):
   \[ 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 0.04167 \]

2. Now, multiply the principal by this result:
   \[ 3650 \times 0.04167 = 152.50 \]

So, the interest is $152.50.

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay back:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50 = 3802.50 \]

Finally, to find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we divide the total amount by the number of months (5):

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5} = 760.50 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

760.50"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we need to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe. We subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:
\[ 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together.

First, the total number of silver pesos:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, the total number of gold pesos:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos together:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Millie makes each hour from her lemonade stand.

First, we need to know how many cups of lemonade she can make. She can make 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, we do:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes from selling all the lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar per cup} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to figure out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 on supplies. So, her profit is:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars (revenue)} - 18 \text{ dollars (cost)} = 18 \text{ dollars (profit)} \]

To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we need to know how long it takes her to sell all the lemonade. She sells 4 cups per hour, so:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we divide her total profit by the number of hours to find her profit per hour:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ dollars (profit)}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

So, Millie makes $2 profit per hour.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means that the 12.8 hectares is the remaining \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land.

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what the whole amount of land is. We can set up the problem like this:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \text{ of the land} = 12.8 \text{ hectares}
\]

To find the total land, we need to divide 12.8 hectares by \( \frac{2}{5} \). This is the same as multiplying 12.8 by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[
12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The choir has 52 members in total.
2. Half of the choir members are boys, and half are girls. So, there are 26 boys and 26 girls.
3. The performance is only with the girls, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.
4. On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, only half of the 26 girls can perform:
   \[
   \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ girls}
   \]
5. The choir's 3 teachers decide to join the performance. So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls:
   \[
   13 + 3 = 16 \text{ people}

\[ 6 \text{ erasers} \times 2 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much 8 pencils cost. Each pencil costs $3, so:
\[ 8 \text{ pencils} \times 3 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together to get the total cost:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars} + 24 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is 36 dollars.

First, we need to find out how much it costs for Dasha to ride all 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, for one ride, Dasha spends:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars per ticket} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars per ride} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's look at David. David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which lets him ride all 9 rides.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the total cost Dasha paid:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."

So, the total number of gifts is:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Next, Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for all the gift bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

144 inches Ã· 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that the ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to add the parts of the ratio together:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find out how many popsicles each part represents, we divide 165 by 11:
\[ 165 \div 11 = 15 \]

So, each part of the ratio is equal to 15 popsicles.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ popsicles} \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ popsicles} \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 a month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:**
   - Each one costs $10 a month.
   - But Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling them together.
   - First, we find out what 20% of $20 is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - So, the discount is $4.
   - The total cost for both services after the discount is:

Therefore, Tim saves \(\boxed{34}\) dollars per month by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to the streaming services."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how long Carol spent on each part of her work:
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: Half the time she spent writing, so 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes

2. Next, we need to convert all the times to the same unit. Let's use minutes:
   - Writing the song: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
   - Recording the song: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes (already in minutes)

3. Now, let's add up all the time she spent:
   - Total time = 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes

4. To find out what percentage of her total time she spent editing, we use this formula:
   - Percentage = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
   - Percentage = (90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100

5. Let's do the math:
   - Percentage = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Now, let's add the cards Erica made to the pre-made cards:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

So, Erica started with 50 cards.

Next, she passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. The total number of cards she passed out is:
\[ 24 + 5 = 29 \]

Now, let's subtract the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had:
\[ 50 - 29 = 21 \]

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from her family and friends. So, we add these to the cards she has left:
\[ 21 + 17 = 38 \]

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

1/3 of 12 = 4 slices for Bill.

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So:
1/4 of 12 = 3 slices for Mark.

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we add those to the slices given away:
7 slices (given away) + 2 slices (Jenny ate) = 9 slices.

1. **Find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one hour:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy each hour.

2. **Calculate how much energy it uses in 8 hours:**
   - If Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the total energy used is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the new usage time:**
   - If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the new energy usage:**
   - The new total energy used is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

5. **Find out how much energy is saved each day:**
   - The energy saved each day is:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

6. **Convert the daily savings to kilowatt-hours:**
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is 1000 watt-hours, the daily savings in kilowatt-hours is:
     \[
     \frac{4500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total savings over 30 days:**
   - The total energy saved over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many stripes all the zebras have together. We have:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(17 \times 2 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the 36-striped zebra: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. To do this, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras. We have 4 zebras in total.

So, the average number of stripes is:
\[ \frac{88}{4} = 22 \]

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Number of Sandwiches Needed:**
   - There are 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - So, we need 20 Ã· 4 = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Amount of Meat and Cheese Needed:**
   - Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

3. **Cost of Meat:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - So, 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 Ã— $7.00 = $35.00.

4. **Cost of Cheese:**
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - So, 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 Ã— $3.00 = $15.00.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know that Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. The problem says that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. So, if he has 40 cannolis, he must have:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

3. Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

4. Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis. So, the new number of corns is:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. Now, we need to find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has. We add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:
   \[
   60 + 100 = 160
   \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
160

"Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps in a day. He already walked half of his goal, which is 5,000 steps, going to and from school. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

Let's figure out how many steps he took during his jog:

1. First, we add the steps he took to and from school and the steps with his friend:
   5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

2. Elliott had 2,000 steps left after his jog, so we subtract the steps he had left from his total goal:
   10,000 (total goal) - 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps

3. Now, we know he had already taken 6,000 steps before his jog, so the steps he took during his jog are:
   8,000 (steps taken before he had 2,000 left) - 6,000 (steps before the jog) = 2,000 steps

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many words are in the book. The book has 45 pages, and each page has 200 words. So, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words per page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
\[ 9000 \text{ words} \div 300 \text{ words per minute} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, but it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to leave 10 minutes before his 60-minute deadline:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, we subtract the time it takes him to read from the time he needs to leave:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to find out how much the company paid the employees in May.

1. **Number of employees in May:** 40
2. **Hourly wage:** $15
3. **Hours per week:** 40
4. **Weeks in May:** 4

To find out how much one employee earns in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, for all 40 employees:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid the employees in June.

1. **Number of employees in June:** 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

To find out how much one employee earns in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, for all 30 employees:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we add the amounts paid in May and June to get the total payment for both months:
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 168000 \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how much money Sally has left after her shopping trip.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs half of $3, which is $1.50.

The total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, she bought 4 magnets, and each magnet costs $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ 3.00 \]

"Okay, let's figure out how much Tim spent on fireworks for the Fourth of July.

1. Tim buys a package of fireworks for $400.
2. He also buys another pack that costs twice as much as the first one. So, the second pack costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of both packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. To find the discount amount, we calculate \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. After the discount, the cost of the two packages is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.
7. To find the total amount Tim spent, we add the cost of the discounted packages and the finale firework: \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

So, Tim spent a total of 1110 dollars.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Marcy makes 50,000 candles. She says they are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles might explode.
2. To find out how many candles might explode, we need to calculate 1% of 50,000:
   \[
   1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 500
   \]
   So, 500 candles might explode.

3. Out of these 500 candles that might explode, 5% of them also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
4. To find out how many of these 500 candles smell like wet dog, we need to calculate 5% of 500:
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much each blouse costs after the discount. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there's a 30% discount.
2. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by 30% (or 0.30):
   \[
   20 \times 0.30 = 6
   \]
   So, the discount is $6 per blouse.
3. Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:
   \[
   20 - 6 = 14
   \]
   So, each blouse costs $14 after the discount.
4. Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price by 4:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let's say Joanne gathers \( x \) apples from the average trees.

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so that's \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so that's \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Now, let's add up the numbers we know:

\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we're doing it in math class!

We have a herd of camels and dromedaries. We know two things:
1. There are 180 heads in total.
2. There are 304 humps in total.

Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. We need to find out how many dromedaries there are.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( C \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we can write two equations:
1. The total number of heads:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]

Subtract 180 from both sides:
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[
D = 180 - C
\]
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"Okay, let's figure out how many kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week trip.

First, we need to break down the trip into parts:

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - So, for 4 days, he traveled: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers is: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers.

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all, so he traveled 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - So, for 7 days, he traveled: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers.

Now, let's add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

So, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week trip.

   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, if Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, Timothy's locker must be 2 times bigger:

3. Oliver is at 3,000 feet on the mountain.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver needs to climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   \[

"Mr. Josue got some money from two banks to help his store. The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so that's $8000. Before he got this money, he already had $5000. 

To find out how much money he has now, we add all the money together:
- Money from the first bank: $4000
- Money from the second bank: $8000
- Money he already had: $5000

So, $4000 + $8000 + $5000 = $17000

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we start with 50 cats on the rock. Then, four boats come and each boat takes away 5 cats. So, we need to find out how many cats the boats took in total:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the number of cats the boats took from the total number of cats:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. We need to find out how many cats that is:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Bill pays for the streaming service over 2 years.

First, for the first 6 months, Bill pays $8 each month. So, we do:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]
That's $48 for the first 6 months.

Next, for the next 8 months, the price goes up to $12 each month. So, we do:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]
That's $96 for the next 8 months.

Finally, for the last 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 24 - 6 - 8 = 10), the price is $14 each month. So, we do:
\[ 10 \times 14 = 140 \]
That's $140 for the last 10 months.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - So, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Find the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - So, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - So, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Find the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many employees each type of vehicle can hold:

1. **Buses**: Each bus can hold 60 employees. There are 4 buses.
   - So, 4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

2. **Minibusses**: Each minibus can hold 30 employees. There are 6 minibusses.
   - So, 6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

3. **Minivans**: Each minivan can hold 15 employees. There are 10 minivans.
   - So, 10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up all the employees that can be transported by the buses, minibusses, and minivans:

Lillian has 3 homemade bird feeders and 3 store-bought bird feeders. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds. The homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

First, let's find out how many birds the store-bought feeders attract:
- 3 store-bought feeders Ã— 20 birds per feeder = 60 birds

Next, let's find out how many birds the homemade feeders attract:
- 3 homemade feeders Ã— 30 birds per feeder = 90 birds

Now, we add the birds from both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
- 60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Kenny wants to go to an amusement park, and the ticket costs $100. He also wants to have $50 left over for spending money. So, he needs to make a total of $150 from selling his PokÃ©mon cards.

Each card sells for $1.5. Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest, which is 2/3 of his cards.

Let's call the total number of cards Kenny has \( C \).

The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}C \).

The money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \]

We know this amount needs to be $150:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]

First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2 \times 1.5}{3}C = 150 \]
\[ \frac{3}{3}C = 150 \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Initial Plan:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He planned for half of the guests to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each.
   - The other 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each.

2. **Calculating the Total Hotdogs Prepared:**
   - For the 18 guests who get 2 hotdogs each: \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - For the 18 guests who get 1 hotdog each: \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs prepared: \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

3. **What Actually Happened:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs needed: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

4. **Finding the Shortage:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short: \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Indras has 6 letters in her name.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. The problem says her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

So, let's find half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Now, we add 4 to this number to get the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Finally, we add the number of letters in both names to get the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

13"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Charlotte's order costs after the discount.

First, we need to add up the cost of all the items she wants to buy:
- The pots and pans cost $120.00.
- The mixing bowls cost $20.00.
- Each utensil costs $5.00, and she wants 5 of them, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

So, the total cost before the discount is $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The store is giving a 20% discount on everything. To find out how much the discount is, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20):
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

The discount is $33.00. To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

132.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up the cost of all the things Dora wants to buy:
- The skipping rope costs $6.
- The board game costs $11.
- The playground ball costs $2.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we need to add up the money Dora has:
- She saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mom gave her $16.

So, the total money Dora has is:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs to buy everything. We do this by subtracting the total money she has from the total cost:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. So, we need to find three quarters of 100:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
   So, Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we need to find twice 75:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
   So, Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we need to find one-fifth of 150:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]
   So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. We have 15 gallons of gas divided equally into 5 containers. So, we divide 15 by 5:
   \[
   15 \div 5 = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
   \]

2. Next, Josey needs 1/4 of a container. So, we need to find out how much 1/4 of 3 gallons is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8:
   \[
   0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

So, Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Total Money George Had:**
   George started with $5.

2. **Money Left:**
   He had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1% of $5 left. 
   1% of $5 is \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars.

3. **Money Spent:**
   So, the money he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of Chips:**
   George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

5. **Money Spent on Candy Bars:**
   The total amount spent is $4.95, and he spent $1.20 on chips.
   So, the amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

6. **Number of Candy Bars:**
   Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   The number of candy bars he bought is \( \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \).

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the whole cake weighs 20 ounces. Rory cuts it into 8 pieces. To find out how much each piece weighs, we divide the total weight by the number of pieces:

\[ \text{Weight of each piece} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece. So, they have eaten:

\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

To find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we subtract the weight of the pieces they ate from the total weight of the cake:

\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many oranges Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, we add these together:

34 + 22 = 56 oranges

Next, we need to share these oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. That means there are 8 people in total:

2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person gets:

56 oranges Ã· 8 people = 7 oranges per person

So, everyone will get 7 oranges.

"Okay, let's figure out the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup.

1. **Onions:**
   - The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine likes to double that amount, so he uses \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.
   - Onions cost $2.00 per pound.
   - So, the cost for the onions is \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pound} = 8 \text{ dollars}\).

2. **Beef Stock:**
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - Each box costs $2.00.
   - So, the cost for the beef stock is \(2 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 4 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for all the ingredients is \(8 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Cost per Serving:**
   - The soup serves 6 people.
   - To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: \(12 \text{ dollars} \div 6 \text{ servings} = 2 \text{ dollars/serving}\).

So, the cost per serving is \(2\) dollars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Wayne's Drive Time:**
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

2. **Bernadette's Drive Time:**
   - Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's.
   - So, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \), Bernadette wants to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.

4. **Bernadette's Departure Time:**
   - Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).
   - So, Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

5. **Wayne's Departure Time:**
   - Wayne leaves 4 minutes before \( T \), so he leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes.

6. **Difference in Departure Times:**
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

So, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to figure out the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 times 3, which is 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]

To find the width, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we know the width is 40 feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up all the sides, or using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack has 20 beads.
- So, Elizabeth's total beads = 1 pack of red * 20 beads/pack + 2 packs of clear * 20 beads/pack = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Next, let's find out how many beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack has 20 beads.
- So, Margareth's total beads = 3 packs of blue * 20 beads/pack + 4 packs of red * 20 beads/pack = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has compared to Elizabeth:
- Difference = Margareth's total beads - Elizabeth's total beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   - When Marcus wakes up, the house is 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking:**
   - Marcus bakes for 3 hours.
   - Each hour, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees.
   - So, the total temperature increase from baking is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
     \]
   - After baking, the temperature of the house is:
     \[
     40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
     \]

3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window:**
   - Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - So, the total cooling is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how long it took Jon to finish the triathlon. We add up the times for each part:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

So, Jon's total time is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it took James to finish each part of the triathlon:

1. **Swim:**
   - Jon took 40 minutes.
   - James is 10% faster, so he took 10% less time.
   - 10% of 40 minutes is:
     \[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ minutes} \]
   - So, James took:
     \[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

2. **Bike:**
   - Jon took 80 minutes.
   - James took 5 minutes longer, so:
     \[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Run:**
   - We don't know how long James took to run yet, so let's call it \( R \) minutes.
   - Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time was 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
   - Jon's total time was 170 minutes, so James' total time was:
     \[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can set up an equation to find \( R \):

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Let's solve for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long Movie C is. The problem says Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1.25 hours to minutes:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Next, the problem tells us that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie B is 80 minutes long.

Finally, the problem says that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ 80 \div 4 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance like this:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   The speed is 32 miles per hour, and the time is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours (because 30 minutes is half an hour).
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles per hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So for 16 miles:
   \[
   \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much the hay costs. Each bail of hay costs $3. So for 8 bails:
   \[
   \text{Cost of hay} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 6 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bill} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Finally, we need to find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay. We subtract the cost of the hay from the total money he has:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total. She has 4 dozen eggs from the cases and 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen would be:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass needs 5 eggs, so:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. So, the number of trays she can put out is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

   Joey now has 240 points.

3. Marcy starts with 225 points.
4. Marcy scores 10 more points. So, we add 10 to 225:
   \[
   225 + 10 = 235
   \]
   Marcy now has 235 points.

5. To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Find the cost of each sneaker:**
   The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. To find the cost of each sneaker, we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers.
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each. To find the total revenue from the flash sale, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   He started with 48 sneakers and sold 17 at the flash sale. To find out how many sneakers were left, we subtract the number sold at the flash sale from the total number of sneakers.
   \[
   \text{Sneakers left} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   He sold the remaining 31 sneakers for $25 each. To find the total revenue from the department store, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - You get one popcorn and one soda for $1 extra.
   - So, the total cost with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

2. **Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The regular movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let's call the cost of the popcorn \( P \).

   So, the total cost without the super ticket is $12 + $3 + \( P \).

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.

   So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   12 + 3 + P = 21 - 2
   \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the right side: \( 21 - 2 = 19 \).
   - Now the equation is: \( 12 + 3 + P = 19 \).
   - Combine the numbers on the left side: \( 15 + P = 19 \).
   - Subtract 15 from both sides to solve for \( P \): \( P = 19 - 15 \).
   - So, \( P = 4 \).

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much it cost to fill one balloon before the price went up. We know that 20 balloons cost $900. So, we divide $900 by 20:

\[
900 \div 20 = 45
\]

So, each balloon originally cost $45 to fill.

Next, the price of filling each balloon went up by $20. So, the new price for each balloon is:

\[
45 + 20 = 65

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to figure out the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car goes 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance is:
  \[
  60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]
- For the second part, the car goes 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. So, the distance is:
  \[
  30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, let's add up the distances to get the total distance:
\[
120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, let's add up the times to get the total time:
\[
2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{miles per hour}

1. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800.
   - So, the total value of the sapphires is \( 8 \times 800 = 6400 \) dollars.

2. Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.
   - The value of 3 sapphires is \( 3 \times 800 = 2400 \) dollars.
   - Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of 2 rubies is \( 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \) dollars.

3. After the trade, Jenna has:
   - \( 8 - 3 = 5 \) sapphires left.
   - 2 rubies.

4. Now, let's calculate the total value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies:
   - The value of the 5 sapphires is \( 5 \times 800 = 4000 \) dollars.
   - The value of the 2 rubies is \( 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \) dollars.

First, we need to find out how much soil one raised bed can hold. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:

\[ 2 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

So, one raised bed holds 32 cubic feet of soil.

Bob has 10 raised beds, so we need to find out how much soil all the beds together can hold. We multiply the volume of one bed by the number of beds:

\[ 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 10 = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume of soil by the volume each bag holds:

\[ \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the potting soil is:
1920"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Red Cards**: We know there are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The problem says there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find out how many more green cards there are, we need to calculate 60% of 15.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards.
   - Therefore, the total number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, let's add up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

So, the total number of cards is 78.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest.
2. Her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which means her friend saw \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.
3. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies already there, so now there are \( 50 + 25 = 75 \) fairies.
4. After a while, 30 fairies flew away.
5. So, the number of fairies left is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

The number of fairies remaining is 45."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many puppies there are in total. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, we add these together:

\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. So, we add these together too:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we want to find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots. To do this, we divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \frac{7}{20} \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

35%"
"Okay, let's figure out how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed for his horses. We need to add up the weight of all the different types of feed and then see how many trips it will take to move everything with his truck.

1. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes
   - Each box weighs 1 pound
   - Total weight of sugar cubes: \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds
   - Total weight of carrots: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds
   - Total weight of hay: \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds
   - Total weight of oats: \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:
\[
2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Cans:**
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans each week.
   - Each can is worth 2 cents.
   - So, the money from cans each week is: 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

2. **Bottles:**
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles each week.
   - Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - So, the money from bottles each week is: 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

3. **Total Weekly Earnings:**
   - Total money each week = Money from cans + Money from bottles
   - Total money each week = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

4. **Total Monthly Earnings:**
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Total money in a month = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks
   - Total money in a month = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many plants Toni has. We know that Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. 

To find 60% of 10, we do:
\[ 10 \times 0.60 = 6 \]

So, Toni has 6 more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we know Toni has 16 plants. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we subtract 7 from Toni's 16 plants:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

9"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Ali had $21 to start with. Leila gave him half of her $100. Half of $100 is $50. So, Ali got $50 from Leila. Now, we add the $50 to the $21 Ali already had. 

$21 + $50 = $71

So, Ali now has $71.

1. First, we need to find out how much the tip is. The tip is 1/5 of the cost of the pizza.
2. The cost of the pizza is $15.
3. To find 1/5 of $15, we divide 15 by 5:
   \[
   15 \div 5 = 3
   \]
   So, the tip is $3.
4. Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount:
   \[
   15 + 3 = 18

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks, and each deck has 25 cards. So, we multiply:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards she has. She has 5 boxes, and each box has 40 cards. So, we multiply:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the basketball cards and the baseball cards to find the total number of cards:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cards} \]

Each student gets 10 cards. To find out how many students there are, we divide the remaining cards by 10:
\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \text{ students} \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, let's calculate how much Becky paid:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.45 = 9\) dollars.
- Becky got a $1 discount.
- So, the total cost after the discount is \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars.
- Kelly got a 10% discount.
- To find the discount amount, we calculate \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- So, the total cost after the discount is \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Kelly paid 9 dollars.
- Becky paid 8 dollars.
- The difference is \(9 - 8 = 1\) dollar.

So, Kelly paid 1 dollar more than Becky.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many of each thing are in one room:
- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 sheets Ã— 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 pillow cases Ã— 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up all the things in one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

So, in one room, there are 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

Since there are 80 rooms, we need to multiply the number of pieces of laundry in one room by 80:
- 15 pieces/room Ã— 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Initial number of shoes:** Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. **Shoes received on Monday:** He gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
3. **Shoes received on Wednesday:** He gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. **Shoes received on Friday:** He gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. **Total shoes before discarding:** Now, let's add all the shoes he has:
   \[
   200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]
6. **Shoes discarded on Saturday:** Frank gets rid of 180 shoes.
7. **Final number of shoes on Sunday:** To find out how many shoes he has left, we subtract the shoes he discarded from the total:
   \[
   300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

So, on Sunday, Frank will have 120 shoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know the pen costs $2.
2. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. So, we need to find three times the price of the pen and then subtract $1.
   - Three times the price of the pen is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).
   - Then, we subtract $1: \(6 - 1 = 5\).
   - So, the piece of paper costs $5.

3. Now, we add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

1. **First, find out how many pencils there were at the start:**
   - There are 30 students in the class.
   - Each student started with 10 pencils.
   - So, the total number of pencils at the start is \(30 \times 10 = 300\) pencils.

2. **Next, find out how many pencils were used after two months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - So, the number of pencils used is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \) pencils.
   - The number of pencils left after two months is \(300 - 60 = 240\) pencils.

3. **Finally, find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \) pencils.

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. We need to find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat.

Let's call the number of carrot sticks \( c \).

The number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

First, we need to get rid of the 2 on the right side. We do this by subtracting 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Now, to find \( c \), we need to get rid of the fraction. We do this by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long the remoras are in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet:

6 inches Ã· 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Benny saw 2 remoras, so we need to find the total length of both remoras:

2 remoras Ã— 0.5 feet/remora = 1 foot

Now, we know the shark is 10 feet long. To find out what percentage of the shark's body length the remoras take up, we use this formula:

(Length of remoras Ã· Length of shark) Ã— 100%

So, we plug in the numbers:

(1 foot Ã· 10 feet) Ã— 100% = 0.1 Ã— 100% = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. 

If 20 students do not have desktop computers, then these 20 students represent one-fourth of the total number of students. To find the total number of students, we need to figure out what number, when divided by 4, gives us 20.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20 \]

To solve for the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

If we just add 9 and 6, we get 15. But wait! The 3 kids who are allergic to both are counted twice. So, we need to subtract those 3 kids to avoid double-counting.

So, the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we know there are 32 kids in Gina's class. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic from the total number of kids:

2. **Hotel:**
   - The normal price for the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - But it's a busy weekend, so the hotel is 20% more expensive.
   - To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price.
   - 20% of $1500 is: \( 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \) dollars.
   - So, the price per day during the busy weekend is: \( 1500 + 300 = 1800 \) dollars.
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is: \( 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost of the Trip:**
   - Add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. One-third of the Pomeranians are girls. So, we do:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature of the three places, we need to add up the highest temperatures and then divide by 3, because there are 3 places.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48Â°F.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21Â°F.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3Â°F.

First, we add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Next, we divide the total by 3 to find the average:
-30 Ã· 3 = -10

So, the average highest temperature of these 3 places is -10Â°F.

1. First, we need to know how many eggs each tray can hold. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so we need to find out how many eggs can fit on both trays together. We do this by multiplying the number of eggs each tray can hold by the number of trays:
   \[
   24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs}
   \]
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total. We need to find out how many eggs won't fit on the trays. We do this by subtracting the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs:
   \[
   64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs}

1. **Cost of Razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - There are 4 razors in each pack.

2. **Buy One Get One Free:**
   - If Heather buys 1 pack, she gets another pack for free.
   - So, for $4.00, she gets 2 packs.

3. **Using the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After using the coupon, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack has 4 razors.
   - So, 2 packs have:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}

"To figure out how tall the human pyramid is, we need to add up the heights of all the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and going up to the top.

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add all these heights together to get the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

1. Charisma works for 8 hours each day.
2. She takes a 5-minute walk every hour.
3. So, in one day, she takes 8 walks (one for each hour).
4. Each walk is 5 minutes long, so in one day, she walks:
   \[ 8 \text{ walks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]
5. She works for 5 days, so over 5 days, she walks:

Paul drives his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He does this for 14 days.

1. **Morning Rides:**
   - Each morning ride costs $6.
   - He drives in the morning for 14 days.
   - So, the total cost for the morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

2. **Afternoon Rides:**
   - Each afternoon ride costs $2.
   - He drives in the afternoon for 14 days.
   - So, the total cost for the afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - To find the total amount of money Paul spent, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides.
   - Total cost = \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars.

So, Paul spent **112** dollars on driving his car during these two weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes, and each box has 10 oranges. So, we multiply:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, we add 20 to the number of oranges Ashley brought:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges that Ashley and Brianne brought together to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To make one Greek orange pie, you need 3 oranges. So, we divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, let's write down what we know:
- The first venue has a flat fee of $200, and it costs $5 for food per guest.
- The second venue costs $25 per guest, and food is included in that price.

We need to find out how many guests, \( x \), would make the total cost the same for both venues.

For the first venue:
- The total cost is $200 plus $5 for each guest.
- So, the total cost is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second venue:
- The total cost is $25 for each guest.
- So, the total cost is \( 25x \).

We want to find when these two costs are the same:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 20x \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests needed for the two venues to cost the same is:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we would in middle school math class.

We know that:
1. Lily, David, and Bodhi together found 43 insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Then, Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
- And Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects (since David found half of what Bodhi found).

Now, we can write an equation based on the total number of insects:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ D + D + 7 + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we solve for \( D \):
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Now we can find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. We need to find out how much yarn they used together.

First, let's add the fractions:
- Mariah used 1/4 of a skein.
- Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4. So, we convert 1/2 to 2/4:
- 1/2 = 2/4

Now, we add the fractions:
- 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

So, together they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. We know that a full skein has 364 yards. To find 3/4 of 364, we multiply:
- 3/4 * 364 = (3 * 364) / 4 = 1092 / 4 = 273

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. She got 2 packs of strawberry, 1 pack of grape, and 1 pack of green apple. The grape pack cost $2, and the green apple pack cost half as much as the grape pack, so it cost $1.

Now, we know the total cost of all the gum was $7. We need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's call the cost of each strawberry pack \( S \).

The total cost can be written as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

First, we add the costs of the grape and green apple packs:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 2S = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{4}{2} \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

   - From a 2 x 8 piece of wood, you can get 400 sticks.

3. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

4. **Cheapest Option:**
   - The 2 x 4 piece of wood is cheaper, so we should buy as many of these as possible.

5. **How Many 2 x 4 Pieces Can He Buy?**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

6. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - So, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

2. Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed. Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
   - So, 24 legs / 2 legs per pair = 12 pairs of snowshoes.

3. Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
   - So, 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00.

Therefore, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

2. Next, we need to find out how much these 10 trips cost. Each trip costs $2.20. So, we multiply:
   \[
   10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week}

\[ 4 \times \text{(number of onions Sophia bought)} = 12 \]

To find the number of onions Sophia bought, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, let's find out how many potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 4 potatoes and that's 4 times what Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{(number of potatoes Sophia bought)} = 4 \]

To find the number of potatoes Sophia bought, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

First, let's see how many skeins are needed for one grandchild:
- A hat takes 2 skeins.
- A scarf takes 4 skeins.
- A sweater takes 12 skeins.
- A pair of mittens takes 1 skein.
- A pair of socks takes 2 skeins.

Now, let's add these up for one grandchild:
2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we need to multiply the number of skeins for one grandchild by 3:
21 skeins/child Ã— 3 children = 63 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

"Okay, let's figure out how many math problems Chris has left to do.

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he does 12 problems.
   - So, he has \(100 - 12 = 88\) problems left.
3. On Tuesday, he does 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
   - He did 12 problems on Monday, so on Tuesday he does \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.
   - Now, he has \(88 - 36 = 52\) problems left.
4. On Wednesday, he does one-quarter of the remaining problems.
   - One-quarter of 52 is \(52 \div 4 = 13\) problems.
   - So, he has \(52 - 13 = 39\) problems left.

Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - So, Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
   - So, Kathy picks 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - So, Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

5. **Total picking rate:**
   - To find the total, we add up the quarts each person picks per hour.
   - Total = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
   - Total = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning.
2. They sold 93 loaves in the morning.
3. They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.
4. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

First, we need to find out how many loaves were sold in total:
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Next, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (baked) - 132 (sold) = 68 loaves left

Finally, we add the 6 loaves that were returned:
68 (left) + 6 (returned) = 74 loaves

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is:
74"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Jackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. He bought 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips. We need to find out how many rows of flowers he will plant.

First, let's figure out how many rows of red tulips he can plant:
- He has 36 red tulips.
- Each row can fit 6 red tulips.
- So, the number of rows of red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's figure out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant:
- He has 24 blue tulips.
- Each row can fit 8 blue tulips.
- So, the number of rows of blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to get the total number of rows:
- Total rows = 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows.

So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

"Heather has a big bag of raisins with 27 cups in it. She wants to use the raisins for three things: cookies, granola, and snack mix. She's going to split the raisins equally, so each thing gets the same amount.

First, we need to figure out how many cups each thing gets. We do this by dividing the total number of cups by 3:
\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]
So, each thing gets 9 cups of raisins.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we divide the total cups of raisins for cookies by the amount needed per batch:
\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} \]

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3:
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Current Daily Cost:**
   - Ada uses 12 kilowatts per hour.
   - Each kilowatt per hour costs $1.50.
   - So, her daily cost is \( 12 \times 1.50 = 18 \) dollars.

2. **Additional Daily Cost with the New Device:**
   - The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour.
   - So, the additional daily cost is \( 2 \times 1.50 = 3 \) dollars.

3. **Total Daily Cost After Adding the Device:**
   - The total daily cost is \( 18 + 3 = 21 \) dollars.

4. **Weekly Costs:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Current weekly cost: \( 18 \times 7 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Weekly cost after adding the device: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) dollars.

5. **Difference in Weekly Costs:**
   - The difference is \( 147 - 126 = 21 \) dollars.

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they can paint a whole house in 10 days. That's because 5 days is for half, so 10 days is for the whole house.
2. Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, and there are 24 hours in a day, then one person would take \(10 \times 24 = 240\) hours to paint the whole house.
3. If 5 people are working together, they can do the job 5 times faster. So, we divide the total hours by 5: \(240 \div 5 = 48\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

48"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Ophelia's Sofas and Chairs:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - She has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so if she has 20 sofas, she must have 22 chairs (because 20 + 2 = 22).

2. **Jenna's Chairs:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Since Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has 3 times that, which is 66 chairs (because 3 Ã— 22 = 66).

3. **Jenna's Sofas:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Since Jenna has 66 chairs, she must have 64 sofas (because 66 - 2 = 64).

4. **Total Sofas and Chairs:**
   - Ophelia's total: 20 sofas + 22 chairs = 42 items.
   - Jenna's total: 64 sofas + 66 chairs = 130 items.
   - Combined total: 42 + 130 = 172 items.

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. The total amount he paid was $48. We need to find out how much the headphone set cost and then see how many more CDs he could have bought with that money.

1. First, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid:
   \[
   48 - 4 = 44
   \]
   So, the headphone set cost $44.

2. Now, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44. Each CD costs $4, so we divide the $44 by the cost of one CD:
   \[
   44 \div 4 = 11
   \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"Okay, let's figure out how many hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks.

1. Josh usually works out for 4 hours each week.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, let's find out how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours:
- Total weeks: 8
- Weeks he worked out for 5 hours: 2
- Week he worked out for 6 hours: 1
- Weeks he worked out for 4 hours: \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\)

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each type of week:
- For the 5 weeks he worked out for 4 hours: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours
- For the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours
- For the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

Finally, let's add all these hours together:
- Total hours: \(20 + 10 + 6 = 36\)

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Initial number of passengers:** There are 48 people on the bus.
2. **First stop:**
   - **Passengers getting off:** 8 people get off the bus.
   - **Passengers remaining:** \( 48 - 8 = 40 \) people.
   - **Passengers getting on:** 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus.
   - **Number of people getting on:** \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) people.
   - **New total:** \( 40 + 40 = 80 \) people.

3. **Second stop:**
   - **Passengers getting off:** 21 people get off the bus.
   - **Passengers remaining:** \( 80 - 21 = 59 \) people.
   - **Passengers getting on:** 3 times fewer people than those who got off get on the bus.
   - **Number of people getting on:** \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) people.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will be 27 in 5 years.
   - So, right now, Jame is \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

2. **Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

3. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, the cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) years old in 8 years.

4. **Cousin's Current Age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then right now the cousin is \(55 - 8 = 47\) years old.

5. **Age Difference Now:**
   - The difference in their ages right now is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know the computer costs $1,100.
2. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.
3. Now, we add the cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
4. The total amount Errol spent is $2,400. So, the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
5. Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

So, one monitor costs $300.

1. We know that there are 20 kids in total, and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.
2. Each boy brought back 60 seashells.
3. Each girl brought back the same number of seashells as the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's break it down:
- The number of seashells each boy brought: 60
- The number of seashells each girl brought: 60 (same as the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many as the boys)

Now, let's do the math:
- 4 * 60 = 240
- 60 + 240 = 300

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"Okay, let's figure out the total thickness of the four books on the shelf.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it's \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]

Next, add 45:
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]

Finally, add 62:
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

Emma wants to make 72 vlogs in a month. She already made some vlogs in the first three weeks:
- In the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
- In the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
- In the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

First, let's add up the vlogs she has already made:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, we need to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs. We do this by subtracting the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the tip is. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the tip is $10.

Next, we add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Now, the total bill is $60. Since you and your wife are splitting the bill evenly, each of you would pay half of the original $50 bill:
\[ 50 \div 2 = 25 \]

But you also have to pay the entire tip of $10. So, you need to add the tip to your half of the bill:
\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

So, you end up paying $35.

1. **Total Days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the Month:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set Up the Problem:**
   - Let's say Elvis saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half.
   - In the second half, he saves twice as much each day, so he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day.

4. **Total Savings:**
   - In the first half, he saves \( 15x \) dollars.
   - In the second half, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars.
   - The total savings for the month is \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

5. **Monthly Saving Target:**
   - Elvis wants to save $1125 in total.
   - So, \( 45x = 1125 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Amount Saved Each Day in the Second Half:**
   - In the second half, he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day.

So, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."
"Okay, let's figure out how much change Verna got back. 

First, we need to find out how much she spent on each type of fruit:

- For the apples: 3 apples * $1.50 each = $4.50
- For the oranges: 5 oranges * $0.80 each = $4.00
- For the peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75 each = $4.50

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount she spent:

- Total cost = $4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20.00, so to find out how much change she got back, we subtract the total cost from $20.00:

- Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, Verna received $7.00 in change.

- Pens: He wants 2 pens, and each pen costs $0.25.
  \[ 2 \times 0.25 = 0.50 \]

- Calculator: He wants 1 calculator, and it costs $12.00.

Now, let's add up all these costs to get the total before the discount:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00 \]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find the discount amount:
\[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

First, we need to know how many bottles of water Bill already has. He has 2 cases, and each case has 24 bottles. So, we multiply:

2 cases Ã— 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water Bill needs for his 70 guests. Each guest will need 2 bottles, so we multiply:

70 guests Ã— 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we need to figure out how many more bottles Bill needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. The problem says that when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, twice that time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add 2 minutes to that:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

54"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much John makes in one week. He works 5 hours each day for 4 days a week. So, we multiply the hours he works each day by the number of days he works in a week:

5 hours/day Ã— 4 days/week = 20 hours/week

Next, we need to find out how much he earns in one week. He gets paid $2 for each hour he works. So, we multiply the number of hours he works in a week by his hourly pay:

20 hours/week Ã— $2/hour = $40/week

Now, we know John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save this amount, we divide the total amount he wants to save by the amount he earns each week:

$80 Ã· $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The foot-long fish sub costs $40.
2. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. So, we need to multiply $40 by 3:
   \[
   40 \times 3 = 120
   \]
3. Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 21 buttons in total.
2. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each.
3. The rest of the buttons, which is 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, have 4 holes each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes:

- For the 7 buttons with 2 holes each:
  \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

- For the 14 buttons with 4 holes each:
  \[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ 70 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
2. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, we need to divide Timothy's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, we need to divide Zack's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Octavia drinks half of this, so she drinks:
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The doctor wants Juan to drink the daily recommended amount, which is 4 cups. So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. The pet shop has 6 cages of rodents. Three of these cages have 10 hamsters each, and the other three cages have 5 guinea pigs each.

First, let's find out how many hamsters there are:
3 cages Ã— 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

Next, let's find out how many guinea pigs there are:
3 cages Ã— 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, let's add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much Susan weighs. Mark weighs 150 pounds, and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. So, we do:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \]
Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. So, we do:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \]
Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. We add their weights together:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]
The total weight is 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \]

So, the average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Starting Point**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees above the ground when you look from Sahir's house.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves up 5 degrees every hour.

3. **Time Passed**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement**: To find out how much the sun moves in 10 hours, we multiply the number of hours by the degrees it moves each hour:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle**: To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle to the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"Okay, let's figure out how much James spends on candles for his two sons.

1. First, we need to know the ages of the two sons.
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. Next, we need to find out how many candles are needed in total.
   - The older son needs 12 candles.
   - The younger son needs 8 candles.
   - So, the total number of candles needed is \(12 + 8 = 20\).

3. Now, we need to figure out how many packs of candles James needs to buy.
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

4. Finally, we need to calculate the total cost.
   - Each pack costs $3.
   - So, the total cost is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) dollars.

James spends $12 on candles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total time she spent reading in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert this time into pages. Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we multiply the total minutes she read by the number of pages she reads per minute:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

So, Judy read 140 pages in the first week.

In the second week, she read 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
240"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches. A third of 12 is 4, so Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. A quarter of 12 is 3, so Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, let's add up how many sandwiches they ate together: 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches they ate from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.

So, the number of sandwiches left is 5.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

The problem says that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let \( N \) be the nephew's age today, in 7 years, the nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):

1. First, divide both sides by 3:
\[ 51 \div 3 = N + 7 \]
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

2. Next, subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 17 - 7 = N \]
\[ 10 = N \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave her $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of what she got for each of the previous three teeth. Half of $1.00 is $0.50. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Richie scored 80 goals. The problem says Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, to find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's score:
80 - 20 = 60 goals for Mark.

Next, the problem also says Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's score:
80 - 45 = 35 goals for Anna.

Now, to find out how many goals all three teenagers scored together, we add up their individual scores:
80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175 goals.

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Total Money Peter Has:**
   Peter starts with $70.

2. **Spending on Wooden Action Figures:**
   - From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends money on wooden action figures.
   - Each wooden action figure costs $5.
   - He spends an equal amount each day, so for 4 days, he spends \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) dollars.
   - The number of wooden action figures he buys is \( 20 \div 5 = 4 \).

3. **Remaining Money:**
   - After buying the wooden action figures, he has \( 70 - 20 = 50 \) dollars left.

4. **Spending on Plastic Action Figures:**
   - From Thursday to Saturday, he spends money on plastic action figures.
   - Each plastic action figure costs $2.
   - He spends an equal amount each day, so for 3 days, he spends \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
   - The number of plastic action figures he buys is \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \).

5. **Total Number of Action Figures:**
   - Total action figures = 4 wooden figures + 3 plastic figures = 7 figures.

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have 7 action figures.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many roses Ford needs to supply to all the flower shops each week. 

- The first shop needs 20 roses.
- The second shop needs 15 roses.
- The third shop needs 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses needed each week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows each week:
Ford grows 40 roses every week.

Now, let's see how many roses Ford is short each week:
65 roses needed - 40 roses grown = 25 roses short each week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to find out how many roses Ford is short in a month:
25 roses short each week * 4 weeks = 100 roses short in a month

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many months are in 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Katina takes out each month. She takes out $100 every month. So, over 24 months, she will take out:
   \[
   24 \text{ months} \times \$100/\text{month} = \$2400
   \]

3. Now, we subtract the total amount she took out from the initial amount in her savings account. She started with $3000, so:
   \[
   \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600
   \]

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - The food truck buys bread for $3.00 a loaf.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - The food truck spends $30.00 on cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.

3. **Total Cost for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - Add the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments.
   - Total Cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

4. **Revenue from Selling 10 Sandwiches:**
   - The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00.
   - For 10 sandwiches, the total revenue is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

5. **Net Profit:**
   - Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \]

Now, if she sells each crayon muffin for $1.50, we can find out how much money she can make by multiplying the number of crayon muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, Kate can make:

\[ 36 \] 

$36.00 in total."
"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom.

First, we need to find out how big his bedroom is. The room is 18 feet long and 12 feet wide. To find the area, we multiply the length by the width:

\[ 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's break down the costs:

1. **New Carpet Cost:**
   The new carpet costs $12 per square foot. So, for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2,592 \]

2. **Padding Cost:**
   The padding costs $2 per square foot. So, for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]

3. **Old Carpet Removal Cost:**
   The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet. So, for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

4. **New Carpet Installation Cost:**
   The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet. So, for 216 square feet:

Maggie's oven is a bit tricky. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually gets to 468 degrees. That means it's 18 degrees too hot. 

First, let's find out what percentage 18 degrees is of 450 degrees:
\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is 4% too hot. Now, we need to find out what temperature Maggie should set it to if she wants it to be 520 degrees.

If the oven is 4% too hot, then the temperature she sets it to should be 4% less than 520 degrees. Let's call the temperature she should set it to \( x \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.04:
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to get it to 520 degrees.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Now, we subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Next, we add the values of both houses to find the total:

First, we need to find out how much 2 boxes of contacts cost with the discount. Each box is $100.00, and there's a 10% discount. 

10% of $100.00 is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discount for one box is $10.00. The price for one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes. Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the number of pairs of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:

First, we need to find out how many hours Jill worked:
- On Saturday, Jill worked 2 hours.
- On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour.
- So, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many hours John worked:
- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill. Since Jill worked 2 hours, John worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill. Since Jill worked 1 hour, John worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them earned:
- Jill earned $10 per hour, so she earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John earned $10 per hour, so he earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we need to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- John earned $70 and Jill earned $30, so John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns in total. She does aerobics for 2 hours, and each hour she burns 500 calories. So for aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

Next, she runs for 1 hour, and each hour she burns 600 calories. So for running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we need to find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories. We can set up a simple proportion:

100 ml of water / 200 calories = x ml of water / 1600 calories

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:
x = (100 ml * 1600 calories) / 200 calories
x = 160000 ml / 200
x = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We know that the jar has three types of jelly beans: red, blue, and green. The note on the jar tells us:
- There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
- There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

1. **Red Jelly Beans:**
   - Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).

2. **Green Jelly Beans:**
   - Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

3. **Total Jelly Beans:**
   - The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. So, we can write the equation:
     \[
     B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
     \]

4. **Combine the Terms:**
   - Adding the terms together, we get:
     \[
     B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 3B = 4500
     \]

5. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
     \[
     B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
     \]

6. **Calculate the Number of Red and Green Jelly Beans:**
   - Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
   - Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

7. **Find the Difference:**
   - To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
     \[
     1515 - 1485 = 30
     \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Jared is trying to get better at typing. He starts by typing 47 words per minute (WPM). After some practice, he can type 52 WPM. If he keeps improving and adds another 5 WPM, we need to find the average of his three typing speeds.

First, let's figure out his third typing speed:
52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we have three speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add these three numbers together and then divide by 3:
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Now, divide 156 by 3:
156 Ã· 3 = 52

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much weight Martin will lose if he eats Cheerios every day for 5 weeks. We know he loses 1.25 pounds each week. So, we multiply 1.25 by 5:

\[ 1.25 \times 5 = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much weight Martin will gain if he eats donuts every day for 5 weeks. We know he gains 1.75 pounds each week. So, we multiply 1.75 by 5:

\[ 1.75 \times 5 = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in his weight between the two options, we add the weight he would lose (6.25 pounds) to the weight he would gain (8.75 pounds):

\[ 6.25 + 8.75 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many seats Alex needs for her event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people will bring 2 friends.
   - So, the number of friends coming is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Total from Email Invitations:**
   - The total number of people from the email invitations is \(100 + 200 = 300\).

3. **Phone Calls:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - So, the number of spouses coming is \(8 \times 1 = 8\).

4. **Total from Phone Calls:**
   - The total number of people from the phone calls is \(10 + 8 = 18\).

5. **Total Number of Seats Needed:**
   - Adding the totals from the email invitations and the phone calls gives us \(300 + 18 = 318\).

So, Alex will need 318 seats.

2. **Cost of the boots on eBay:**
   - The boots cost $13.
   - The shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so it's \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.
   - So, the total cost on eBay is \( 13 + 8 = 21 \) dollars.

3. **Difference in total costs:**
   - The total cost on eBay is $21.
   - The total cost on Amazon is $20.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Mark's beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall. It doubles in height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's break it down:

- **Day 0:** The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1:** The beanstalk doubles, so it's \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.
- **Day 2:** The beanstalk doubles again, so it's \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet tall.
- **Day 3:** The beanstalk doubles once more, so it's \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, if John eats 200 grams, that's double the amount of mushrooms, which means he gets double the protein:
   \[
   3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
   \]

2. John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein each day.

3. Now, we need to find out how much protein he gets in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Let's figure out how old he is now.

1. If Jerry is \( J \) years old now, then 5 years ago, he was \( J - 5 \) years old.
2. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   J = 2 \times (J - 5)
   \]
3. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[
   J = 2J - 10
   \]
4. To isolate \( J \), we subtract \( J \) from both sides:
   \[
   0 = J - 10
   \]
5. Adding 10 to both sides gives us:
   \[
   J = 10
   \]

So, Jerry is 10 years old now. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[
10 + 3 = 13
\]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

     \]

2. **Cost of the Porcelain Crown:**
   - One of the implants needs a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - So, the total cost for the implants and the crown is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}

3. **Deposit Already Paid:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}

4. **Earnings per Hour:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a problem in math class.

We know that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle \( x \).

The problem says one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \).

It also says one angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \).

Now, we can write an equation to represent the sum of the angles:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Let's add the \( x \) terms together:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we need to find the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy. First, we need to know how much money he has in total.

- He has 8 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
- He has 6 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.
- He has 14 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents.
- He has 15 pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so 15 pennies are worth \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents.

Now, let's add all the money together:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

- There are 5 dogs, so 5 dogs Ã— 4 legs/dog = 20 legs.
- There are 2 cats, so 2 cats Ã— 4 legs/cat = 8 legs.
- There are 10 birds, so 10 birds Ã— 2 legs/bird = 20 legs.

Next, we add up all the legs:
20 legs (dogs) + 8 legs (cats) + 20 legs (birds) = 48 legs.

So, the total number of legs for all the pets in the store is 48.

1. **Birthday Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.

2. **Games He Buys:**
   - In the first year, he buys 1 game each month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
   - In the second year, he buys 2 games each month. So, he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
   - In the third year, he buys 4 games each month. So, he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.

3. **Christmas Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games for Christmas each year. Over 3 years, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all the games together:

Now, we want to know how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. We use the same idea, but this time we need to find the time. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, we plug in the numbers:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 more hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, so we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ 720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. So, he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday. So, he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:
- Monday: $8
- Tuesday: $16
- Wednesday: $64

Total spent: \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
- \(100 - 88 = 12\) dollars.

So, Howard has $12 left.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Patrick made from selling lemonade.

First, we need to calculate how much he made in the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he made \( 15 \text{ cups} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars} \).
- For four hours, he made \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, we calculate how much he made in the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he made \( 10 \text{ cups} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars} \).
- For two hours, he made \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the money he made in both periods:
- Total money made = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Patrick earned a total of 42 dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many times the tires rotate in one month. We know that for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. So, we can find out how many times the tires rotate in one month by doing this:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left( \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}} \right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} \]

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate in one year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} \]

\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we know that each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach this limit, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can handle by the number of rotations per year:

\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} \]

\[ \text{Years} = 6 \]

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
2. The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo for one wash, and this gives you 120 washes.

First, we need to find out how many total pumps are in the bottle. If 2 pumps give you 120 washes, then:

\[ 2 \text{ pumps/wash} \times 120 \text{ washes} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

So, the bottle has 240 pumps of shampoo.

Next, we need to find out how much each pump costs. The bottle costs $24.00, and it has 240 pumps. So, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since we need the answer in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents} \]

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

3. Now, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost.
   \[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

4. Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the shirt and the shorts, we subtract the total cost from $50 to find out how much money he has left.

3. Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants every day for a week. A week has 7 days. So, we need to find out how much butter is needed for 7 days:
   - If 1 pound of butter is needed each day, then for 7 days, he will need \( 1 \times 7 = 7 \) pounds of butter.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

\[ 95060 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65960 \text{ dollars} \]

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months. That means each month he gets:
\[ \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

His research takes 10 times longer than the first 5 months, so:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ months} \]

The first 5 months are already accounted for, so the additional months are:
\[ 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months} \]

For these additional months, each month costs 50% more than the initial $20,000. So, the cost per month for the additional months is:
\[ 20,000 + (20,000 \times 0.5) = 20,000 + 10,000 = 30,000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the additional 45 months:
\[ 30,000 \times 45 = 1,350,000 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find out how many posts are made in the entire month of March, we multiply the number of posts made in one day by the number of days in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts in March is 93000.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year.

First, we need to know how many times Gary does laundry in a year. He does laundry twice a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ times/year} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water he uses each time. Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so:
\[ 104 \text{ times/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/time} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to use that much water. Water costs $0.15 per gallon, so:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Scarlett spent on all the stuff for her aquarium.

First, she found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale. That's a good deal!

Next, she went to the pet store and bought:
- 2 bags of rocks, and each bag costs $2.50. So, 2 bags cost 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
- 3 pieces of coral, and each piece costs $2.00. So, 3 pieces cost 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
- 20 fish, and each fish costs $0.50. So, 20 fish cost 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
- She also bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Aquarium: $10.00
- Rocks: $5.00
- Coral: $6.00
- Fish: $10.00
- Fish food: $2.00

Total cost: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. In the second week, it doubled in height. So, 3 inches times 2 equals 6 inches.
3. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. So, 6 inches plus 4 inches equals 10 inches.

So, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much meat Prince sells in one day. He sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day.
   \[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all the meat from the bull. The bull weighs 750 kg.
   \[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many seats there are in total. The auditorium has 4 rows, and each row has 18 seats. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were taken by the administrators. The problem says one-fourth of the seats were taken by the administrators. So, we divide the total number of seats by 4:
\[ \frac{72}{4} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we subtract the seats taken by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats are left:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Then, we need to find out how many of these remaining seats were taken by the parents. The problem says one-third of the remaining seats were taken by the parents. So, we divide the remaining seats by 3:
\[ \frac{54}{3} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Finally, we subtract the seats taken by the parents from the remaining seats to find out how many seats were taken by the students:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats} \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ 36 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many street lights are at one intersection.
   - Each pole has 4 street lights.
   - There are 6 poles at each intersection.
   - So, the total number of street lights at one intersection is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

2. Next, we need to find out how many street lights are on the whole road.
   - There are 4 intersections.
   - So, the total number of street lights on the whole road is \(24 \times 4 = 96\).

3. Finally, we need to find out how many street lights are working.
   - We know that 20 street lights are not working.
   - So, the number of working street lights is \(96 - 20 = 76\).

The total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first DVD can be played 1000 times in total. It has already been played 356 times. So, we need to find out how many more times it can be played:
   - \( 1000 - 356 = 644 \)
   - The first DVD can be played 644 more times.

2. The second DVD can also be played 1000 times in total. It has already been played 135 times. So, we need to find out how many more times it can be played:
   - \( 1000 - 135 = 865 \)
   - The second DVD can be played 865 more times.

3. To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining plays of both DVDs:
   - \( 644 + 865 = 1509 \)

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509.

"Okay, let's figure out how much John's physical therapy cost.

1. First, we need to find out how many times John went to physical therapy. He went twice a week for 6 weeks.
   - So, 2 times a week * 6 weeks = 12 times.

2. Each time he went, he stayed for 2 hours.
   - So, 12 times * 2 hours = 24 hours in total.

3. The cost for each hour of therapy is $125.
   - So, 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Jim has a 20-pack of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours during an 8-hour school day. So, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, he chews:
   \[
   4 \text{ pieces} + 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 6 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:
   \[
   20 \text{ pieces} - 6 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
5. Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives away:
   \[
   \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:
   \[
   14 \text{ pieces} - 7 \text{ pieces} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. So, to find out how old she is right now, we need to subtract 12 years from 16 years.

16 - 12 = 4

So, Charmaine is 4 years old right now.

Now, we need to find out how old she will be 4 years from now. We add 4 years to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

2. Ashley's internet speed is 20 kilobytes (kb) per second. To find out how many kilobytes she can download in an hour, we multiply her speed by the number of seconds in an hour:
   \[
   20 \text{ kb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds} = 72000 \text{ kb}
   \]

3. Now, we need to convert kilobytes to megabytes. There are 1000 kilobytes in a megabyte, so:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many cars the tow truck pulled in the first three days. The problem says it pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, we can calculate that like this:

10 cars/day Ã— 3 days = 30 cars

Next, we need to find out how many cars the tow truck pulled in the remaining four days. The problem says it pulled 4 fewer cars each day on these days. So, it pulled:

10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

Now, we calculate the total number of cars pulled in the remaining four days:

6 cars/day Ã— 4 days = 24 cars

Finally, we add the number of cars pulled in the first three days to the number of cars pulled in the remaining four days to get the total for the week:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

So, the total number of cars the tow truck pulled that week is:

"To figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, we need to know how tall Adam has to be to ride the roller coaster. The height requirement is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the height in inches:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be. Adam is currently 40 inches tall, so we subtract his current height from the required height:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches every year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 more inches, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by the number of inches he grows each year:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"Okay, let's figure out how much James made from selling those used cars.

First, we need to find out how much money James made from selling the cars. He sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000. So, the total amount of money from selling the cars is:
\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid to get the cars. The company paid 30% of the price of each car to get it. So, for each car, the company paid:
\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
For 10 cars, the total cost to the company is:
\[ 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

Now, we can find out the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total sales:
\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:
\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

So, James made:
\[ 17,500 \]

1. First, we need to find out how many surfers can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet. We know that 25% of the 100 surfers can stay upright.
   - 25% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \) surfers.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 surfers are women. We know that 60% of the surfers who stay upright are women.
   - 60% of 25 is \( 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \) women.

3. Now, to find out how many men can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who can stay upright.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the price of a diamond Jewell. So, we need to multiply $2000 by \(\frac{4}{5}\):
   \[
   \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} = 2000 \times \frac{4}{5} = 2000 \times 0.8 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell. So, we subtract $400 from $1600:
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels:
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a problem in math class.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
   - Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.
   - We need to find out how long it will take Tom to catch up to Bob.

2. **Find the Relative Speed:**
   - Tom is driving faster than Bob. The difference in their speeds is:
     \[
     70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the Time to Catch Up:**
   - To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the relative speed:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}

3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, Tommy caught:
   \[
   11 + 3 = 14 \text{ fish}

"Manny signed up for Karate classes that cost $60 in total. His parents said if the cost per class goes over $10, they won't sign him up again. There are 10 classes in total.

First, let's figure out how much each class costs if Manny goes to all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class goes over $10. If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We want this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve this, we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x \) is positive):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Then, we divide both sides by -10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class goes over $10.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Jewel processes 50 customers each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many customers Jewel processes in a week by multiplying:

\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Now, Julie works twice as fast as Jewel. So, Julie processes:

\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

To find out how many customers Julie processes in a week, we multiply her daily number by 7:

\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To get the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week, we add their weekly totals:

\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:

\[ 1050 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Paisley's Distance:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.

2. **Reggie's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
   - So, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

3. **Lynn's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn.
   - If we let \( L \) be the number of miles Lynn ran, then:
   - \( 20 = L + 3 \)

4. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to solve the equation:
   - \( L + 3 = 20 \)
   - Subtract 3 from both sides:
   - \( L = 20 - 3 \)
   - \( L = 17 \)

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we need to find out how much one orange costs. If three oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples cost. If one apple costs $1.30, then 5 apples cost:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
So, 5 apples cost $6.50.

Next, we need to find out how much 5 oranges cost. If one orange costs $1.10, then 5 oranges cost:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]
So, 5 oranges cost $5.50.

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

     \[
     \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to shovel the earth:**
   - Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth.
   - To find the total time, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel each cubic foot:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds}

"Okay, let's figure out how much Bill's new truck will cost. We need to add up all the parts:

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
3. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade. So, we divide $7,500 by 3:
   \[
   7500 \div 3 = 2500
   \]
   So, the leather seats cost $2,500.
4. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats. So, we subtract $500 from $2,500:
   \[
   2500 - 500 = 2000

   So, the running boards cost $2,000.
5. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[
30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500

"Okay, let's figure out how much Tim will make in a year after his promotion.

1. **Calculate the raise:**
   Tim's current salary is $20,000 a month. A 5% raise means he gets an extra 5% of $20,000.
   \[
   \text{Raise} = 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000
   \]

2. **New monthly salary:**
   Adding the raise to his current salary:
   \[
   \text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000
   \]

3. **Calculate the bonus:**
   The bonus is half of his new monthly salary:

So, Tim will make \(\boxed{262500}\) dollars in a year."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much James spent on the suits:
- He bought 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- So, the total cost for the suits is \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- He bought 10 pairs of dress pants.
- Each pair of dress pants costs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
- The cost of one suit is $750, so the cost of one pair of dress pants is \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the dress pants is \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

Now, let's figure out the cost of the dress shirts:
- He bought 3 dress shirts for each suit.
- He bought 10 suits, so he bought \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- So, the total cost for the dress shirts is \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount James spent:
- Total cost of suits: $7500
- Total cost of dress pants: $1500
- Total cost of dress shirts: $1800
- Total cost of everything: \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

So, the total cost of everything is \(10800\) dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many articles the news website publishes in February. The news website publishes 20 articles every day. Since February has 28 days, we can calculate the total number of articles like this:

\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many articles the sister company publishes in February. The sister company publishes 10 articles every day. So, for 28 days, the total number of articles is:

\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to get the combined total number of articles published by both websites in February:

\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

"To figure out how much flour was in three bags before it was divided, we first need to know how much flour was in one bag. 

Each bag is split into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. So, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Now, since we have three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

\[ 16 \text{ kg/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided is:

48 kg"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Alisa biked. Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So for Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Stanley biked. Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet of soil in one hour. He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.

To find out how many hours it takes to dig 24 feet of soil:
\[ \text{Time for soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to know how long it takes Bill to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so he can dig 2 feet of clay in one hour. He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.

To find out how many hours it takes to dig 8 feet of clay:
\[ \text{Time for clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

2. Three weeks later, she had 70 times as many likes as she did after the first week. So, we need to multiply 2000 by 70:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. Recently, she got 20000 more likes. So, we add these 20000 likes to the 140000 likes she already had:
   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, let's see how much Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday:
- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- So, the total cost before the voucher is \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.
- Clara had a voucher that gave her $2 off.
- So, the final amount Clara paid is \( 400 - 2 = 398 \) dollars.

Next, let's see how much Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday:
- The price per pomegranate increased to $30.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 30 = 600 \) dollars.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
- 10% of 600 is \( 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \) dollars.
- So, the final amount Sheila paid is \( 600 - 60 = 540 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
- The difference is \( 540 - 398 = 142 \) dollars.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find out how much Ariadne made from green hats:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half of what she made from green hats.
   - So, to find out how much she made from green hats, we multiply the sales from red hats by 2.
   - \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \)
   - Ariadne made $800 from green hats.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - We add the sales from red hats and green hats.
   - \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \)
   - So, Ariadne made $1200 in the first month.

3. **Find out how much she made in the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what she made in the first month.
   - To find this, we multiply the total sales from the first month by \(\frac{3}{4}\).
   - \( 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \)
   - So, Ariadne made $900 in the second month.

4. **Calculate the total sales for both months:**
   - We add the sales from the first month and the second month.
   - \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \)
   - So, Ariadne made $2100 in total over the two months.

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

1. First, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves all the guests will eat. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests:
   \[
   3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves}
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many whole eggs are needed. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves:
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to know how much James paid for the plane:
- The plane cost $150,000.

Next, we need to figure out how much he pays each month to keep the plane in a hanger:
- He pays $5,000 a month for the hanger.

Then, we need to find out how much he spends on fuel each month:
- He spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger, so that's $5,000 * 2 = $10,000.

Now, let's add up his monthly costs for the hanger and fuel:
- Monthly hanger cost: $5,000
- Monthly fuel cost: $10,000
- Total monthly cost: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

To find out how much he spends on the hanger and fuel in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
- Annual cost for hanger and fuel: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual cost for the hanger and fuel to get the total cost for the first year:
- Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
- Annual cost for hanger and fuel: $180,000
- Total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts cost together.

- A pound of almonds costs $10, so 1/2 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- A pound of walnuts costs $15, so 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.

So, the total cost for 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts cost together.

- A pound of almonds costs $10, so 1/5 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- A pound of walnuts costs $15, so 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.

So, the total cost for 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we're doing it in math class!

We know two things:
1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

From the problem, we can write two equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (because the total number of animals is 20)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (because sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 70)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Now, we substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Next, we simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

Next, let's look at how the days were distributed:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Last 6 days**: We need to figure out these days.

Now, the problem tells us that the next three days after the 30 days were:

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.
- There are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.
- Total good days: \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

Now, we need to find out what \( S \) is. We do this by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how tall the bamboo is right now in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, if the bamboo is 20 feet tall, we can find out how many inches that is by multiplying 20 by 12:
   \[
   20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We do this by subtracting the current height from the desired height:
   \[
   600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the growth rate per day:
   \[
   360 \text{ inches} \div 30 \text{ inches/day} = 12 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. Then, 8 more dogs join the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys. Now he has 12 dogs and 12 toys.
3. When he goes back, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, 12 dogs doubled is 24 dogs. He needs 12 more toys to have enough for 24 dogs. Now he has 24 toys.
4. When he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone. So, he now has 21 dogs. He doesn't need toys for those 3 dogs anymore, so he needs 21 toys in total.

So, James needs 21 toys in total.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that the total amount of money in the joint savings account is $1200. Dylan invested 2/5 of this total amount. To find out how much Dylan invested, we do this:

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

So, Dylan invested $480.

Next, we need to find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment. We subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Now, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. To find out how much Frances invested, we do this:

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

So, Frances invested $480.

Finally, we need to find out how much money is left after both Dylan's and Frances's investments. This will be Skyler's investment:

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. First, we need to add these together to find out how many signatures they have in total right now:

\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \]

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal:

\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Lorie earns $10 per hour. Karen earns twice as much as Lorie, so:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Karen earns in one day. She works 3 hours each day, so:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she earns in two days. Since she earns $60 per day, in two days she earns:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can figure out how many hash browns one potato makes. 

First, we divide 36 hash browns by 6 potatoes:
\[ 36 \div 6 = 6 \]
So, 1 potato makes 6 hash browns.

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can find out how many hash browns we can make by multiplying the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns each potato makes:
\[ 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much 9 people weigh in total. Jack is one person, and he's riding with 8 other adults, so that's 9 people in total.
2. Each adult weighs about 80 kg. So, to find the total weight, we multiply the number of people by the weight of each person:
   \[
   9 \text{ people} \times 80 \text{ kg/person} = 720 \text{ kg}
   \]
3. The elevator can only hold 700 kg. To find out how much they exceed the limit, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
   \[
   720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

So, they will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

1. **Katarina's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 68 cookies.

2. **Max's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, Max must have:
   \[
   68 + 5 = 73 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookie Monster's Cookies:**
   Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if Max has 73 cookies, the Cookie Monster must have:
   \[
   73 - 12 = 61 \text{ cookies}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Shania is making her dress longer. She first makes it 50% longer than its original length. Then, she adds 20 cm of lace to the bottom. The final dress is 140 cm long.

1. Let's call the original length of the dress \( L \).
2. When Shania makes it 50% longer, the new length is \( L + 0.5L \), which is the same as \( 1.5L \).
3. Then, she adds 20 cm of lace, so the final length is \( 1.5L + 20 \).
4. We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   1.5L + 20 = 140
   \]
5. To find \( L \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   1.5L = 120
   \]
6. Next, divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[
   L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the whole lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - If he mows half the lawn, it will take him half the time.
   - Half of 60 minutes is 30 minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the whole lawn in 40 minutes.
   - If he mows half the lawn, it will take him half the time.
   - Half of 40 minutes is 20 minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - To find the total time, we add the time for each half.
   - 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school. They spend 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and then they spend another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

First, we add the time they spent to get to the library and the fire station:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have to get to school:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we would in middle school math class.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know two things:
1. One of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets.
2. The total of all their ages is 44.

Let's use some letters to make it easier:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( R \) be the age of one of the triplets.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ T = R + 7 \]

From the second piece of information, we know the total age of all the kids:
\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]

Next, we solve for \( R \):
\[ 5R = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R \) (the age of one of the triplets) is 6, we can find \( T \) (the age of one of the twins):
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Next, we need to know how much time John has before dinner:
- He has 3 hours before dinner.
- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is:
3 * 60 = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time John needs for homework from the total time he has before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to take a nap.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. 

To find out how much the lollipops cost in total:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

So, the lollipops cost $2.00. This means the candies must have cost the rest of the total amount:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

Now, we need to find out how much one candy costs:
\[ 4 \text{ candies} \times \text{cost per candy} = \$1.20 \]
\[ \text{cost per candy} = \frac{\$1.20}{4} = \$0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30.

Next, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. 

The cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Now, we add the costs together:
\[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. First, we need to find out how many more coins Neil saves compared to Rong.

2/5 of 20 coins is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Now, let's find out how many coins each of them saves in ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

To find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add Rong's and Neil's savings:

First, we need to find out how much the vaccines cost. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill \( T \). The heartworm check costs 60% of \( T \), which is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25.

   - There are 5 bananas in the crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - So, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the fruits:

   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - So, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - So, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - So, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up all the squares:
- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 18
- Green squares: 24
- White squares: 12

Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

   So, Betty has:
   \[
   50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. To find 20% of $2400.00, we do:
\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, her car payment is $480.00.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after putting money into her retirement and paying for her car. We subtract the amounts for her retirement and car payment from her total paycheck:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Martha's cat can run 15 feet in one second. The problem says the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. So, to find out how fast the turtle goes, we divide the cat's speed by 5:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can go in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find out how much they raise per hour:**
   - They raised $2100 in 3 hours.
   - So, to find out how much they raise each hour, we divide $2100 by 3:
     \[
     \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate how much more they need to raise:**
   - Their goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more hours they need to fundraise:**
   - They raise $700 per hour.
   - To find out how many more hours they need, we divide the remaining amount by the amount they raise per hour:
     \[
     \text{Additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of hours they need to fundraise:**
   - They have already fundraised for 3 hours.
   - Adding the additional hours needed:
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, the total number of hours they have to fundraise to reach their goal is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of that 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. So, we need to find out what 80% of 40% is.
3. To do this, we multiply 40% by 80%:
   \[
   40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%
   \]
   So, 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes.
4. Now, we need to find out what percent of the river's water is used for non-industrial purposes. We do this by subtracting the industrial water usage from the total water usage by the city:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

So, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
8%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many days are in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would be:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much Alex charges for 14 days. If she charges $12 per day, then for 14 days, she would charge:
   \[
   14 \times 12 = 168
   \]

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

168"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much chocolate ice cream the factory can make in one hour. The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so:

\[ \text{Chocolate ice cream per hour} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much vanilla ice cream the factory can make in one hour. The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so:

\[ \text{Vanilla ice cream per hour} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how much of each type of ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
\[ \text{Chocolate ice cream in 48 hours} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \]

For vanilla ice cream:
\[ \text{Vanilla ice cream in 48 hours} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours:
\[ \text{Total quarts} = 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:

3000"
"Okay, let's figure out Marcus's total bill step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each type of item costs:

- Croissants: Marcus bought 5 croissants at $3.00 each. So, 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: He bought 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each. So, 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: He bought 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each. So, 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: He bought 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each. So, 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up all these amounts to get the total before the discount:

$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $50.00:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus's total bill is $45.00.

45.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

The ice cream parlor has a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00.

First, let's see how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

But with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Start with the candy:**
   - Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy.

2. **How much candy do they eat each day?**
   - Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
   - Amy eats 3 pieces a day.

3. **How many days are in two weeks?**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are:
     \[
     2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **How much candy does Ginger eat in 14 days?**
   - Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
     \[
     4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ pieces}
     \]

5. **How much candy does Amy eat in 14 days?**
   - Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
     \[
     3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ pieces}
     \]

6. **How much candy does Ginger have left after 14 days?**
   - Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has:
     \[
     100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces left}
     \]

7. **How much candy does Amy have left after 14 days?**
   - Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has:
     \[
     100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces left}
     \]

8. **How much more candy does Amy have compared to Ginger?**
   - Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces, so Amy has:
     \[
     58 - 44 = 14 \text{ pieces more}
     \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"Mr. Boarden is remodeling his bathroom and needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. His bathroom is 36 square feet, but he only wants to cover two-thirds of it. 

First, we need to find out how many square feet two-thirds of the bathroom is:
\[ \text{Two-thirds of 36 square feet} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many tiles are needed for 24 square feet. Since he needs 24 tiles per square foot:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ tiles/square foot} \times 24 \text{ square feet} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his bathroom.

"Okay, let's figure out how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

First, we need to find out how much it cost James to pick the blueberries. He paid $20 just to go picking, and then he paid $1.5 for each pound of blueberries he picked. He picked 30 pounds, so we need to multiply 30 by $1.5.

\[ 30 \times 1.5 = 45 \]

So, the cost of the blueberries he picked is $45. Adding the $20 he paid to go picking:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

So, the total cost for James to pick the blueberries is $65.

Next, we need to find out how much it would have cost him to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound. Since he picked 30 pounds, we multiply 30 by $2.5:

\[ 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

So, it would have cost him $75 to buy the blueberries at the store.

Now, to find out how much he saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:

\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

First, we need to find out how much more each computer costs now. The original price was $700, and it went up by 10%. 

To find 10% of $700, we do:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 500 computers at the new price. We do:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid is:
\[ 385,000 \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how many calories are in John's omelet. We need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the eggs are \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

2. **Cheese:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
   - Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the cheese are \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

3. **Ham:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of ham (the same as the cheese).
   - Each ounce of ham has 40 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the ham are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, we add up all the calories:
- Calories from eggs: 450
- Calories from cheese: 240
- Calories from ham: 80

Total calories in the omelet: \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

So, the omelet has 770 calories.

First, we need to find out how much 6 pencils cost. Each pencil costs $0.50, so:
6 pencils * $0.50 = $3.00

Next, we need to find out how much 8 erasers cost. Each eraser costs $0.25, so:
8 erasers * $0.25 = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers to get the total cost:
$3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

You paid $10, so to find out how much change you get, we subtract the total cost from $10:
$10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00

So, the change you would get is $5.00.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, we need to find out how many people get interviews.**
   - We know that 100 people apply for the job.
   - 30% of these people get interviews.
   - To find 30% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.30.
   - \( 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \)
   - So, 30 people get interviews.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many of those who get interviews receive a job offer.**
   - We know that 20% of the people who get interviews receive a job offer.
   - To find 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.20.
   - \( 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \)
   - So, 6 people receive a job offer.

3. **Finally, we need to find out how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position.**
   - We know that a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position.
   - To find a third of 6, we divide 6 by 3.
   - \( 6 \div 3 = 2 \)
   - So, 2 people accept the position.

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is:

Helga is a really fast clog dancer. She can tap her right foot 300 times a minute and her left foot 250 times a minute when her arms are at her sides. When she raises her arms, she slows down to 200 taps per minute for both feet.

She dances for a total of 5 minutes, but she only raises her arms for 2 of those minutes. We need to find out how many times she taps both feet in total.

First, let's figure out how many taps she does when her arms are at her sides:
- She dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes.
- Right foot: 300 taps/minute Ã— 3 minutes = 900 taps
- Left foot: 250 taps/minute Ã— 3 minutes = 750 taps

Next, let's figure out how many taps she does when her arms are raised:
- She dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.
- Right foot: 200 taps/minute Ã— 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute Ã— 2 minutes = 400 taps

Now, let's add up all the taps:
- Total right foot taps: 900 + 400 = 1300 taps
- Total left foot taps: 750 + 400 = 1150 taps

Finally, let's add the total taps for both feet:
- Combined total: 1300 + 1150 = 2450 taps

So, the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is:

1. If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, his car will get damaged and it will cost him $450.
2. If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will have to pay a fine of $120 for doing it without permission.
3. He also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25. So, the total cost for the asphalt is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75

Next, we need to find out how many chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair:
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13

So, the total number of chairs sent for repair is:
20 + 13 = 33

Now, to find out how many chairs are left, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
193 - 33 = 160

1. **Total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - So, the total number of slices is \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
   - Each of these 3 people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 12 slices, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) slices per person.
   - So, the total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
   - Each of these 2 people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 12 slices, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \) slices per person.
   - So, the total slices eaten by the remaining two friends is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is \( 24 + 18 = 42 \) slices.

3. Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the cat's time and the dog's time, and then divide by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is 12 inches. So, 8 feet is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

First, we need to find out how many windows Hannah smashed in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.
- Hannah smashed a quarter of these windows, so we need to find 1/4 of 256.
- 1/4 of 256 is 256 / 4 = 64 windows.

Next, we need to find out how many windows Hannah smashed in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.
- Hannah smashed 3/4 of these windows, so we need to find 3/4 of 64.
- 3/4 of 64 is (3 * 64) / 4 = 192 / 4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashed is 112.

First, we need to find out how many spools of thread Candy has in total. We add up all the spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

So, the total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. We add up the light blue and dark blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

So, the total number of blue spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, convert the fraction to a percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

So, 2000 people had voted by midday. That means 3000 people were still waiting to vote.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. To find out how many that is, we do:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 more people voted by 16:00. This means the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know Dora is 15 years old. 

Next, we need to find out how old Dora's father is. The problem says that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate it like this:
\[ \text{Dora's father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Now, we need to find out how old Dora's mother is. The problem says that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate it like this:
\[ \text{Dora's mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Finally, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We add their ages together:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

87"
"Okay, so Greg found $20 and he wants to share it equally with his 3 younger siblings. That means the money will be split among 4 people in total. To find out how much each person gets, we divide the total amount of money by the number of people:

\[ \text{Money per person} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Number of people}} \]

So, we do:

\[ \text{Money per person} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Each of them gets $5.

"Okay, let's figure out the total weight of Cindy's books.

First, we know that Cindy has:
- 2 math and science books, each weighing 2 pounds.
- 1 French book weighing 4 pounds.
- 1 English book weighing 3 pounds.
- 1 history book that weighs twice as much as her English book.

Let's calculate the weight of each type of book:
- The math and science books together weigh \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- The French book weighs 4 pounds.
- The English book weighs 3 pounds.
- The history book weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
\[ 4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many votes candidate A got. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes, and there were 100 voters, we can calculate:
   - 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B got. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate:
   - 50% more than 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C got. We know the total number of votes is 100, and we already know how many votes candidates A and B got. So, we subtract the votes for A and B from the total:
   - Total votes = 100
   - Votes for A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes
   - Votes for C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Boris starts with 100 apples.
2. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has:
   \[ 100 - 23 = 77 \] apples.
3. Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving away 10 apples, Boris has:
   \[ 100 - 10 = 90 \] apples.
4. Beck, after receiving 10 apples, has:
   \[ 77 + 10 = 87 \] apples.
5. Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. We subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:
   \[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much water Peter uses for each type of ice cube.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - So, the total water used for giant cubes is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - So, the total water used for medium cubes is \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - So, the total water used for small cubes is \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces.

Next, we add up all the water used for the ice cubes:
- Total water used = \( 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water Peter had:
- Initial water = 32 ounces.
- Water used = 30 ounces.
- Water left = \( 32 - 30 = 2 \) ounces.

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Clara has 20 books. The problem says that Clara has two times as many books as Steven. So, if we divide Clara's books by 2, we can find out how many books Steven has:
\[ 20 \div 2 = 10 \]
So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, the problem tells us that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Since Steven has 10 books, we can add 6 to find out how many books Alice has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]
So, Alice has 16 books.

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We do this by subtracting the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5. The problem also tells us that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, if we take $2 away from the cost of a gallon jar, we can find out how much a half-gallon jar costs:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to find out how much Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, we multiply the number of gallon jars by the cost of each:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

So, she spent $50 on the gallon jars.

Now, let's calculate how much she spent on 16 half-gallon jars. Each half-gallon jar costs $3, so we multiply the number of half-gallon jars by the cost of each:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

So, she spent $48 on the half-gallon jars.

Finally, to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know there are 50 students in the class. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. 

Next, we're told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's add up the students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music:
\[ 10 + 5 + 10 = 25 \]

So, 25 students have these hobbies. That means the rest of the students, who like to play video games, are:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[ 25 \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Mark made from selling the cards. He got:
- One card worth $4000
- Another card worth $1000
- 30 cards, each worth $50

The total value of the 30 cards is:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Now, we add up all the money he made from selling the cards:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

First, we need to calculate the total cost for each park.

For the first amusement park:
- Each adult costs $26, and there are 2 adults, so that's \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- Each child costs $12, and there are 2 children, so that's \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The total cost for the first park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

For the second amusement park:
- Each adult costs $14, and there are 2 adults, so that's \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- Each child costs $10, and there are 2 children, so that's \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- The total cost for the second park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

1. First, we need to find out how much the vendor used to spend on tomatoes each day. He sold 500 tomatoes a day, and each tomato cost him $0.50.
   \[
   500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.50/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day}
   \]

2. Now, let's see how much he spends with the new vendor. The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.
   \[
   500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.40/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day}
   \]

3. To find out how much he saves each day, we subtract the new cost from the old cost.
   \[
   \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day}
   \]

4. Finally, to find out how much he saves in a week, we multiply the daily savings by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).
   \[
   \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$350/\text{week}

First, we need to know how many weekdays and weekends there are in two 4-week months.

1. **Weekdays and Weekends:**
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.
   - In two 4-week months, there are \(2 \times 20 = 40\) weekdays and \(2 \times 8 = 16\) weekend days.

2. **Chairs Rented on Weekdays:**
   - Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
   - Total chairs rented on weekdays: \(60 \times 40 = 2400\).

3. **Chairs Rented on Weekends:**
   - Candy rents 100 chairs each weekend day.
   - Total chairs rented on weekends: \(100 \times 16 = 1600\).

4. **Total Chairs Rented:**

   - So, 8 dozen glasses is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.

2. **Plates:**
   - Jeff sent 4 dozen plates.
   - 1 dozen is 12 plates.
   - So, 4 dozen plates is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses and plates were broken and subtract those from the total.

3. **Broken Glasses:**
   - 10 glasses were broken.
   - So, the number of glasses left is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. Here's what happens:

1. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 is \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 is \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

3. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

4. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 27 small buttons.
   - From trading remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.

6. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons.
   - 20 large buttons are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Small Buttons (Final Count):**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Small buttons from trading remaining large stickers: 60
   - Small buttons from converting large buttons: 60
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \)

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We know that the council has 33 people. The problem says that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. 

Let's use a simple way to figure this out:

1. Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is \( A \).
2. Then, the number of votes in favor of the regulation is \( 2A \) (because it's twice as many).

Now, we know that the total number of votes is 33, so we can write this as:
\[ A + 2A = 33 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3A = 33 \]

To find \( A \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the regulation is 11. 

Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we multiply 11 by 2:
\[ 2A = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many shirts Krissa needs to order for her preschool students. We'll break it down step by step.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - So, 2 times 11 is 22 students.

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - So, 22 minus 4 is 18 students.

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - So, 18 divided by 2 is 9 students.

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - So, 9 plus 6 is 15 students.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

- The first house needs half as many cases as the second house.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house.

Let's use a variable to make it easier. Let's say the first house needs \( x \) cases of shingles.

1. The first house needs \( x \) cases.
2. The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (because it's double the first house).
3. The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (because it's double the first house).

Now, we add up all the cases for the three houses:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. The third house needs double the first house, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers, and each cucumber costs $2. So, Leila spent:
3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

Jack bought 5 tomatoes, and each tomato costs $1. So, Jack spent:
5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce, and it costs $3. So, Chase spent:
1 lettuce * $3/lettuce = $3

Now, let's add up what they all spent:
$6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14

So, together, they spent $14 to make a salad for the potluck.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know George has 200 bananas. The problem says he has 45% more pears than bananas. To find out how many more pears that is, we need to calculate 45% of 200.

45% of 200 is:
\[ 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, the number of pears he has is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

So, George has 490 fruits in total.

490"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Marissa had $80. She bought a ball for $20. So, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the total money she had:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Now, Marissa has $60 left. She uses this money to buy candy bars for her brother Jimmy. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ 60 \div 5 = 12 \]

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, to find out how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we can do the following steps:

1. First, figure out how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs for 4 liters of juice:
   - If 1 liter needs 5 kilograms, then 4 liters will need \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) kilograms of oranges.

2. Next, calculate the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges:
   - If 1 kilogram costs $3, then 20 kilograms will cost \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) dollars.

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Tanya earned over the two days.

**Monday:**
- Tanya taught 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour she teaches.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 for the day.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, add the extra $5 for teaching more than 3 classes:
\[ 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tanya earned $80 on Monday.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya taught 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour she teaches.
- Since she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she doesn't get the extra $5 for the day.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the hours:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tanya earned $30 on Wednesday.

**Total Earnings:**
Now, let's add her earnings from both days:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tanya earned a total of $110 for the two days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many vanilla scents were sold in total.
   - The company has 4 different vanilla scents.
   - They sold 5 of each vanilla scent.
   - So, the total number of vanilla scents sold is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \).

2. Next, we need to find out how many fruity scents were sold in total.
   - The company has 8 different fruity scents.
   - They sold 2 of each fruity scent.
   - So, the total number of fruity scents sold is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \).

3. Now, we need to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.
   - We subtract the total number of fruity scents sold from the total number of vanilla scents sold.
   - So, \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. So, we multiply 20 by 3:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Next, we need to find out how much more money he needs to make to reach his goal of $135. We subtract the $60 he already made from $135:

\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 more from selling his 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide $75 by 25:

\[ 75 \div 25 = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many hours Tatiana has in total over the weekend:
- On Saturday, she has 7 hours.
- On Sunday, she has 5 hours.
- So, in total, she has 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, we subtract that from the total time:
- 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours left for other activities.

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. Let's find out how much time that is:
- 1/3 of 9 hours = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

So, after playing video games, the time left for soccer is:
- 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
- (Time spent on soccer / Total time) * 100
- (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

50%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Anthony starts with 50 pencils.
2. He gives half of his pencils to Brandon. Half of 50 is 25, so he gives 25 pencils to Brandon.
3. Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
4. He then gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils that is, we calculate 3/5 of 25. 

   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
   \]

5. So, Anthony gives 15 pencils to Charlie.
6. Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Travel Time to the Museum:**
   - Jack drives 150 miles to the museum.
   - He drives at 75 miles per hour.
   - To find out how long it takes to get there, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Travel Time Back Home:**
   - The trip back is the same distance and speed, so it also takes 2 hours.

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - The total time spent driving is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Time Spent at the Museum:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

5. **Total Time Gone from Home:**
   - Add the travel time and the time spent at the museum:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many wheels Henry needs for the cars. Each car needs 4 wheels, and he has 57 cars to assemble. So, we multiply:

57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

Next, we need to find out how many wheels Henry needs for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, and he has 73 motorcycles to assemble. So, we multiply:

73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to get the total number of wheels needed:

228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

So, the number of wheels left is 276.

276"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out what 20% of $1000 is. To do that, we multiply $1000 by 20% (which is the same as 0.20):
   \[
   1000 \times 0.20 = 200
   \]
   So, the discount is $200.

2. Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much we have to pay:
   \[
   1000 - 200 = 800

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Total number of movies**: Mike has 600 movies.

2. **Movies in series**:
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - These series movies cost only $6 each (since they are a third of the normal price).
   - Total cost for series movies: \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars

3. **Remaining movies**:
   - Total remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \)
   - Cost of each older movie: $5
   - Total cost for older movies: \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars

4. **Newer movies**:
   - Number of newer movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)
   - Cost of each newer movie: $10
   - Total cost for newer movies: \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars

5. **Total cost**:
   - Total cost for series movies: $1200
   - Total cost for older movies: $800
   - Total cost for newer movies: $2400
   - Total cost to replace all movies: \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars

So, the total cost to replace all the movies is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much Winston spent on the fruit he picked. 

First, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit:
- Peaches cost $2.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds. So, the cost for peaches is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.
- Plums cost $1.00 per pound, and Winston picked 8 pounds. So, the cost for plums is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) dollars.
- Apricots cost $3.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds. So, the cost for apricots is \(6 \times 3 = 18\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs for all the fruit:
- Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
- Total cost = 12 + 8 + 18 = 38 dollars

So, Winston spent 38 dollars on fruit.

"Okay, let's figure out how far the Llesis family traveled to their vacation spot. We need to break it down into two parts: the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - They drove for 4.5 hours (since they spent 1.5 hours hiking out of the total 6 hours).
   - They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - To find the distance, we use the formula: Distance = Speed Ã— Time.
   - So, the driving distance is \( 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \( 50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour} \).
   - So, their hiking speed is \( 25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \).
   - To find the hiking distance, we use the same formula: Distance = Speed Ã— Time.
   - So, the hiking distance is \( 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Total Distance:**
   - To find the total distance, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Total distance = Driving distance + Hiking distance = \( 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \).

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Emma's Scores:**
   - Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, so she gets \( 10E \) points.
   - Emma collects \( B \) berries, so she gets \( 5B \) points.
   - Emma finishes the level with \( T \) seconds left, so she gets \( 30T \) points.
   - Emma's total score is \( 10E + 5B + 30T \).

2. **Ava's Scores:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies. This gives her \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \) points.
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects \( B + 3 \) berries. This gives her \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \) points.
   - Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left. This gives her \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \) points.
   - Ava's total score is \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \).

3. **Simplify Ava's Total Score:**
   - Combine like terms: \( 10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120 \)
   - Simplify: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

4. **Find the Difference in Scores:**
   - Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
   - Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)
   - Difference: \( (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) \)
   - Simplify: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 10E - 5B - 30T + 25 \)
   - Final difference: \( 25 \)

1. Subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:
   64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

2. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
   34 dollars Ã· 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride 3 times a day.
- They do this for 5 days.
- So, the total number of rides on the usual days is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) rides.

Next, we need to figure out how many times they ride on the special days:
- On these days, they ride twice as much as they do on the usual days.
- Twice 3 rides is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides a day.
- They do this for 2 days.
- So, the total number of rides on the special days is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) rides.

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the special days to get the total number of rides in a week:
- Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
- Total rides = \(15 + 12 = 27\) rides.

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're in middle school.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob had 7 fish in total.
   - 3 of them were orange.
   - 4 of them were white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
   - Let's say he bought \( x \) white fish and \( y \) orange fish.
   - So, \( x + y = 17 \).

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After buying the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
   - The total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
   - This means \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \).

5. **Solve the Equations:**
   - First, simplify the condition equation:
     \[
     3 + y = 2(4 + x)
     \]
     \[
     3 + y = 8 + 2x
     \]
     \[
     y = 8 + 2x - 3
     \]
     \[
     y = 5 + 2x
     \]

   - Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation \( x + y = 17 \):
     \[
     x + (5 + 2x) = 17
     \]
     \[
     x + 5 + 2x = 17
     \]
     \[
     3x + 5 = 17
     \]
     \[
     3x = 12
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
   - Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
   - Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
   - Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
   - Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how far Andy drives each day. He drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home. So, each day he drives:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} + 5 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he drives in a week. He drives to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, in a week, he drives:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to figure out how much gas he uses. His car uses 1 gallon of gas for every 10 miles. So, for 50 miles, he uses:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much money he spends on gas. The price of gas is $3 per gallon. So, for 5 gallons, he spends:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Carrie has 140 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - So, the total value of the quarters is \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

2. **Twenties:**
   - Carrie has 10 twenties.
   - Each twenty is worth $20.
   - So, the total value of the twenties is \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

3. **Spending the Twenties:**
   - Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties.
   - To find out how much she spent, we calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 \).
   - First, find \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 200: \( 200 \div 5 = 40 \).
   - Then, multiply by 3: \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \) dollars.

4. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties: \( 35 + 120 = 155 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how many eggplants Ricardo gets from his eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is 4 eggplants/plant * 8 plants = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to get the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

2. Next, we need to find out how many analog TVs were sold. The problem says that one-eighth of the sales were analog TVs. So, we take the total number of TVs, which is 40, and divide it by 8:
   \[
   \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{40}{8} = 5
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many OLED TVs were sold. We know the total number of TVs sold is 40, and we already found out that 10 were smart TVs and 5 were analog TVs. So, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs:

1. **Find the night temperature:**
   - During the day, it's 45 degrees.
   - At night, it's 33 degrees colder.
   - So, the night temperature is 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees.

2. **Determine how much the temperature needs to rise:**
   - The pipes will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees.
   - The current night temperature is 12 degrees.
   - To prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to rise to 32 degrees.
   - So, the temperature needs to rise by 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees.

3. **Calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn:**
   - Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees.
   - To raise the temperature by 20 degrees, Carson needs to burn 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many groups there are. We have 90 people, and each group has 9 people. So, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. The problem says that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we need to find \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups had members bring back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. So, we need to find out how many seashells 9 members in one group brought back:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Since there are 6 groups, we multiply the number of seashells one group brought back by 6:

\[ 18 \times 6 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:

108"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The train starts with 172 people.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on. So, we need to subtract 47 and add 13:
   - 172 - 47 = 125
   - 125 + 13 = 138
3. At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, we subtract 38 from 138:
   - 138 - 38 = 100

So, after the second stop, there are 100 people on the train.

100"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many bottle caps Damien finds in one day. He finds 10 bottle caps each day.

2. Next, we need to find out how many bottle caps he finds in a whole month. Since there are 30 days in the month, we multiply the number of bottle caps he finds each day by the number of days in the month:
   \[
   10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps}
   \]

3. Now, we need to figure out how much money 300 bottle caps are worth. Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
   \[
   300 \text{ bottle caps} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/bottle cap} = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

75"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jamie made last Tuesday.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Jamie works 8 hours at $20 per hour.
   - So, for 8 hours, she earns: 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so she worked 11 - 8 = 3 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime pay is 150% of her regular pay, which means she gets 1.5 times her regular rate.
   - Her regular rate is $20, so her overtime rate is: 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour.
   - For 3 hours of overtime, she earns: 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. **Total Pay:**
   - To find the total pay, we add the regular pay and the overtime pay.
   - Total pay = $160 + $90 = $250

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work last Tuesday.

"Okay, let's count the lions in the enclosure. There are 12 female lions, and half as many male lions, which means there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. There are also 14 lion cubs. 

To find the total number of lions, we add them all together:
12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32 lions

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure.

32"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40.
   - To find 25% of $40, we multiply 40 by 0.25:
   \[ 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]
   So, the discount is $10.

2. Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price.
   - The sale price is:
   \[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]
   So, the jeans cost $30 after the discount.

3. Finally, we need to find out how much change Mike will get if he pays with a $50 bill.
   - The change is:
   \[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20 left over.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Initial number of employees**: The company starts with 200 employees.
2. **New employees each month**: The company hires 20 new employees every month.
3. **Number of months**: We need to calculate for 3 months.

First, let's find out how many new employees are hired in 3 months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, let's add these new employees to the initial number of employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Now, each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, let's calculate the total monthly salary for 260 employees:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much the company pays in total over 3 months:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Billy's Starting Pay:**
   - Billy started at $10 per hour.

2. **Billy's First Raise:**
   - After 2 months, Billy got a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - So, his new pay is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **Billy's Second Raise:**
   - On his first anniversary, Billy got another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - So, his new pay is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

4. **Sally's Starting Pay:**
   - Sally started at $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting pay.
   - So, Sally's pay is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

5. **Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - Billy earns $11.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, he earns $11.50 Ã— 20 = $230.
   - Sally earns $10.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, she earns $10.50 Ã— 20 = $210.

6. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings.
   - $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much 3 loaves of bread cost. Each loaf costs $2, so:
\[ 3 \text{ loaves} \times 2 \text{ dollars per loaf} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much 2 bagels cost. Each bagel costs $1, so:
\[ 2 \text{ bagels} \times 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the 3 loaves of bread cost compared to the 2 bagels. We do this by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} - 2 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score. 

Pierson's score is 278 points. Half of 278 is:
278 / 2 = 139

Nikita scored 11 more than 139, so:
139 + 11 = 150

Now, to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
278 + 150 = 428

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many students there are in total. The school has 40 classes, and each class has 25 students. So, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many teachers there are. Each class has 3 teachers, and there are 40 classes. So, we multiply the number of classes by the number of teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Now, let's figure out how many trees the students will plant. Each student plants 1 tree, so:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's figure out how many trees the teachers will plant. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

First, let's add up all the stuffed animals she has right now:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Bubbles wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's call the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of this total. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks. So, we need to calculate how many hours that is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week. There are 7 days in 1 week. So, we need to calculate how many hours that is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours Kris has played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, we need to find out how many more hours she needs to play:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play **9 hours** to earn the achievement.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in a middle school math class.

### Problem:
Two cars are driving on a highway. The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour when the second car passes it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. If both cars continue on the highway at the same speed, how many miles will separate them after 2 hours?

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Calculate the distance the first car travels in 2 hours:**
   - The first car is going 60 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance it travels is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance the second car travels in 2 hours:**
   - The second car is going 70 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance it travels is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the distances traveled:**
   - The second car travels 140 miles.
   - The first car travels 120 miles.
   - The difference in distance is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much the diamond and the gold cost together.
   - The diamond costs $600.
   - The gold costs $300.
   - So, the total cost of the materials is $600 + $300 = $900.

2. Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium that James pays for the ring to be made.
   - To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30.
   - 0.30 * $900 = $270.

3. Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find out how much James paid in total.
   - Total cost of materials: $900
   - Premium: $270
   - Total amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"Okay, let's figure out the school's overall pass rate step by step.

1. **Third Grade:**
   - 340 out of 500 third-graders passed.
   - Pass rate for third grade: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.

2. **Fourth Grade:**
   - 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed.
   - Pass rate for fourth grade: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.

3. **Fifth Grade:**
   - The fifth grade's pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate.
   - Fourth grade's pass rate is 40%, so the fifth grade's pass rate is \( 2 \times 40\% = 80\% \).
   - 80% of 400 fifth-graders passed: \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \) fifth-graders passed.

4. **Total Number of Students Who Passed:**
   - Third grade: 340
   - Fourth grade: 40
   - Fifth grade: 320
   - Total passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)

5. **Total Number of Students:**
   - Third grade: 500
   - Fourth grade: 100
   - Fifth grade: 400
   - Total students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

6. **Overall Pass Rate:**
   - Overall pass rate: \( \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%.

1. First, we need to find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. He has 2 bags, and each bag has 72 chips.
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. Next, we need to know how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch:
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how long it can be, we divide the total area by the height:

2. Next, we need to find out how much tea the 16 students drank. Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts. So, we multiply:
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. Now, we add the tea that both groups of students drank to find the total amount of tea consumed:
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}

4. We know there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, to find out how much tea there was at the beginning, we add the tea that was consumed to the tea that is left:
   \[
   38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
   \]

5. Finally, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so we divide:

1. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so:
   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so:
   \[
   20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ students}

"Okay, so Felix is making money by helping kids get their stuff out of trees. He charges 25 cents for each branch he has to climb. Over the week, he made $105. We need to figure out how many branches he climbed on average each day.

First, let's find out how many branches he climbed in total. We do this by dividing the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

3. The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. So, we subtract the number of marshmallows used and lost from the total number of marshmallows:
   \[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

4. Now, we have 14 marshmallows left. Since there are 2 kids (John and DeSean), we need to divide the remaining marshmallows equally:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can only play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, let's add up all the quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Tanya makes a salt scrub that fits into a 10-ounce jar. She uses different ingredients: salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. Here's what we know:

1. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's use a variable to make it easier. Let's say the amount of citrus zest is \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Next, the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

Now, let's add up all the ingredients to make sure they fit into the 10-ounce jar:
\[ z \text{ (zest)} + z \text{ (fragrance)} + 2z \text{ (salt)} + 2z \text{ (sugar)} + 4z \text{ (oil)} = 10 \text{ ounces} \]

Combine all the \( z \) terms:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]

To find \( z \), divide both sides by 10:
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we know the amount of oil is \( 4z \) ounces. Since \( z = 1 \):
\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. So, he gives away:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars. We subtract the cars he sold and the cars he gave away from the total number of cars he had initially:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money the students raised in total. The charity raised $175,000 in total, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we know that 20 students raised this $125,000 together. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

6250"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, she walked for:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. Now, we add the time from both days to find the total time in hours:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]
4. To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. When Hunter first got to school, he saw 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars came in. So, we add those 20 cars to the 50 cars already there:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
   Now there are 70 cars in the parking lot.
3. During the lunch break, half of the cars left. To find out how many cars left, we divide 70 by 2:
   \[
   70 \div 2 = 35
   \]
   So, 35 cars left the parking lot.
4. To find out how many cars are left in the parking lot during the lunch break, we subtract the 35 cars that left from the 70 cars that were there:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
35"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Cycles per day**: John does 30 cycles of work each day.
2. **Tasks per cycle**: Each cycle has 5 tasks.
3. **Earnings per task**: Each task pays $1.20.

First, let's find out how many tasks John does in one day:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how much John earns in one day:
\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$180 \text{ per day} \]

Now, let's find out how much John earns in a full 7-day week:
\[ \$180 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260 \text{ per week} \]

So, John makes:
\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored:
   \[
   14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
   \]
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored:
   \[
   10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
   \]
4. To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add the points from both games:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
   \]

So, the total points Sasha scored during both games is:
\[
18

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages, and each package has 11 tins. So, we multiply:

8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages, and each package has 6 tins. So, we multiply:

6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:

88 tins of cat food - 36 tins of dog food = 52 tins.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. 

Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. So, we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Now, let's simplify this equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( P \). First, subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards.

Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards, which is:

\[ 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards, which is:

\[ 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"Okay, let's figure out how many eggs Cindy had in total.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, she had:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ blue eggs}
   \]
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. So, she had:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9 \text{ pink eggs}
   \]
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, she had:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ yellow eggs}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much it costs to ship the book. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 for each pound. So, we multiply 4 pounds by $0.35:

\[ 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]

Next, the shipping company also charges $0.08 for each mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away. So, we multiply 20 miles by $0.08:

\[ 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total shipping cost:

\[ 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost to ship the book is $3.00.

Next, we need to figure out how much money Milly will get back from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of that. To find 75% of $32, we multiply $32 by 0.75:

\[ 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

So, Milly will get $24 back from Amazon.

Now, let's figure out how much money Milly will lose. She initially paid $32 for the book, but she will only get $24 back. She also has to pay $3 to ship the book. So, we subtract the refund from the original cost and then add the shipping cost:

\[ 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \]

Therefore, Milly will lose:

\[ 11 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Mulan has $40. Her dad gives her $100 more, so:
$40 + $100 = $140

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans. Each pair costs $30, so:
2 Ã— $30 = $60

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total amount she spends is:
$60 + $20 = $80

Now, we subtract the total amount she spent from the money she had:
$140 - $80 = $60

So, Mulan has $60 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month. Here's how much he makes each week:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up what he made in the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from the monthly total:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

So, Boris makes 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"Okay, let's figure out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - So, each week she spends \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes recording videos.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes recording videos.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours each week writing songs.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) minutes writing songs.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing makeup six days a week.
   - So, each week she spends \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes doing makeup.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \( 90 \times 4 = 360 \) minutes doing makeup.

Now, let's add up all the time she spends on TikTok in a month:
- Time spent recording videos: 288 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a month:
\[ 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 \] minutes.

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost Angela to get everything installed.

First, let's look at what the standard package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Now, let's see what Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

Next, we need to find out how many extra items Angela needs installed:
- Extra mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Extra chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Extra pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

So, Angela needs 2 extra mirrors, 1 extra chandelier, and 10 extra pictures. That's a total of:
2 + 1 + 10 = 13 extra items

Each extra item costs $15.00, so the cost for the extra items is:
13 Ã— 15 = 195 dollars

The base installation fee is $129.00, so the total cost is:
129 + 195 = 324 dollars

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. 

Next, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]
So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much 40% of Anthony's savings is, we calculate:
\[ 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]
So, 40% of $30.00 is $12.00.

Finally, we add this $12.00 to Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has saved:
\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, Roy has saved:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - So, \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - So, \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - So, \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - So, \( 480 \) inches Ã· 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Mason is riding his bike at a speed of 8 miles per hour. He rides for 4 hours, takes a break, and then rides for another 6 hours. To find out how many miles he has traveled in total, we need to add the distances he traveled before and after his break.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the two distances together to get the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. This means that together, they cover the whole distance in 18 hours.

Now, if we want to find out how long it takes for 4 turtles to cross the same distance, we need to consider their speed. The problem says that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

Let's break it down:

1. **Speed of Kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross, we can think of it as one kangaroo taking 18 hours to cover 1/3 of the distance. So, one kangaroo would take 18 hours to cover the whole distance if it were alone.

2. **Speed of Turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if a kangaroo takes 18 hours to cover the distance, a turtle would take twice as long to cover the same distance. That means one turtle would take 36 hours to cover the distance.

3. **Four Turtles Together:**
   - If one turtle takes 36 hours, four turtles working together would cover the distance faster. Since they are all moving at the same speed, we can divide the time by 4.
   - So, 36 hours divided by 4 turtles is 36 / 4 = 9 hours for one turtle to cover 1/4 of the distance. But since they are all moving together, the total time for all four turtles to cover the whole distance is 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

But wait, we made a mistake! We need to consider that the turtles are moving together, not separately. So, the correct calculation is:

- If one turtle takes 36 hours, four turtles together would take 36 / 4 = 9 hours to cover the whole distance.

So, the correct answer is:

27

But let's double-check:

- If one turtle takes 36 hours, four turtles together would take 36 / 4 = 9 hours to cover the whole distance.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora. So, Rory made:
   \[
   20 + 20 = 40 \text{ dishes}
   \]
3. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory. So, Jada made:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The laptop Erika wants costs $600.
2. If she trades in her old laptop, the price goes down by $200. So, the new price is:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400
   \]
3. Erika has $150 from her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's add up the money Erika has:
\[
150 + 80 = 230
\]

Now, we know the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in is $400, and she still needs $50 more. So, the money she has in her purse plus the $230 she already has should equal $350 (because $400 - $50 = $350).

So, we set up the equation:
\[
x + 230 = 350
\]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides:
\[
x = 350 - 230
\]
\[
x = 120
\]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple gives 5 slices and he has 3 large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we need to find out how many slices he gets from the small apples. Each small apple gives 3 slices and he has 5 small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract that from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

So, the number of apple slices left is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day.
2. So, the total milk from 3 cows is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.
3. The farmer wants to have 25 liters of milk a day.
4. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current amount from the desired amount: \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.
5. Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk, to get 10 more liters, the farmer needs \(10 \div 5 = 2\) more cows.

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

First, we need to find out how much of each glue stick is left. We know that each glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue that is left:
\[

2. Next, we need to know how much money Gabriel already has:
   - He has $5,000 from working on weekends.
   - His brother gave him $200.
   - So, the total amount of money he has is $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

3. Now, we need to find out how much more money Gabriel needs:
   - The total cost is $10,800.
   - He has $5,200.

Next, he buys six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he buys three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Craig spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount he started with:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Craig has 19 dollars left.

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Miss Susan's class has 20 students in total. We know that:

- 8 students are good at English only.

To find out how many students are good at both math and English, we need to subtract the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students.

So, we do:
20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7 students who are good at both math and English.

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:
5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12 students.

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

First, we need to know how long the whole concert is. The concert is 2 hours long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the 10-minute intermission. So, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's see how much time each group needs. Each group needs:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total available time by the time each group needs:

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest.

1. **Principal (P):** The amount of money Brenda starts with is $300.
2. **Interest Rate (r):** The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. So, three-quarters of $300 is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]
3. **Time (t):** The time is 3 years.

To find the total interest earned over 3 years, we use the simple interest formula:
\[
\text{Interest (I)} = \text{Principal (P)} \times \text{Rate (r)} \times \text{Time (t)}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
I = 300 \times 225 \times 3
\]
\[
I = 300 \times 675

\[
I = 202500

Now, to find the total amount of money Brenda will have after 3 years, we add the interest to the principal:
\[
\text{Total Amount (A)} = \text{Principal (P)} + \text{Interest (I)}

\[
A = 300 + 202500

\[
A = 202800

This means 20 white shirts have collars, and the other 20 don't have collars.

Next, we need to find out how many floral shirts have buttons and how many don't. The store has 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:

50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are compared to white shirts without collars. We already know there are 30 floral shirts without buttons and 20 white shirts without collars. So, we subtract:

30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.

First, we need to find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y. Since he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X, and he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ goats from Farm Y} \]

Next, we subtract the number of goats sold from the original number of goats in each farm:
- Goats left in Farm X: \( 55 - 10 = 45 \)
- Goats left in Farm Y: \( 45 - 20 = 25 \)

Now, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left:

Now, we need to apply the discount. You get $2 off for each basket of red food, and you're buying 3 baskets, so:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Subtract the total discount from the cost of the red food:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]

2. Next, we need to know how long it takes to clean one room. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, to clean 45 rooms, we multiply 45 by 20:
   \[
   45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}

3. In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built so far and then double that number. So, the total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Doubling this gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add up all the homes built over the three years:
12 (first year) + 36 (second year) + 96 (third year) = 144 homes.

I am three years younger than my brother, so if I am \( x \) years old, my brother is \( x + 3 \) years old.

I am also 2 years older than my sister, so my sister is \( x - 2 \) years old.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) years old.

When you add all our ages together, it equals 87. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, let's simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + x + 3x + 3 - 2 + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Next, subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Now, divide both sides by 6:

10 * 6 = 60

So, at the end of the first day, the total number of infected people is the original 10 plus the 60 new ones:

10 + 60 = 70

On the second day, all 70 infected people each infect 6 more people. So, we multiply 70 by 6 to find the new infections:

Now, we add these 420 new infections to the 70 already infected:

70 + 420 = 490

On the third day, all 490 infected people each infect 6 more people. So, we multiply 490 by 6:

   - So from 80 slices, she made \( 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Paige raised \(\boxed{40}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can figure out how many silver coins she has by subtracting 30 from 70. 

So, 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the gold coins and the silver coins together:

70 gold coins + 40 silver coins = 110 coins.

So, Gretchen has 110 coins in total.

110"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, we need to find out how many burritos all the students got. There are 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos.
   - So, 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

2. Next, we need to add the burritos that Mr. George ate. He ate 20 burritos.
   - So, 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos

3. Now, we need to find out how many burritos were left over. Mr. George ordered 600 burritos in total.
   - So, 600 burritos (ordered) - 520 burritos (used) = 80 burritos

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

80"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, if there are 12 red cars, then:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ green cars}
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. So, if there are 10 green cars, then:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ blue cars}
   \]
4. **Total Cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[
12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}
\]

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
75 - 52 = 23
\]

So, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
23

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. Let's use these clues to find out how many books Fawn has.

1. Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
2. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \) books.

Now, we can write an equation for the total number of books:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Let's simplify this equation:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( F \):
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much Madeline pays each month. She pays 60% of the total $400.
   - 60% of 400 is \( 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \) dollars.

2. Now, we know the total cost is $400, and Madeline pays $240. So, Keenan pays the rest.
   - The rest is \( 400 - 240 = 160 \) dollars.

3. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to find out how much Keenan spends each week.
   - \( 160 \div 4 = 40 \) dollars per week.

So, Keenan spends 40 dollars per week.

"Okay, let's figure out how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten so far.

1. **First Day:**
   - Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   - To find out how many pieces that is, we do:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - Tobias ate 10 pieces.
   - So, by the end of the second day, he has eaten:
     \[
     24 + 10 = 34 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Third Day:**
   - After the second day, there are:
     \[
     60 - 34 = 26 \text{ pieces left}
     \]
   - Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.
   - To find out how many pieces that is, we do:
     \[
     \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Total Pieces Eaten:**
   - By the end of the third day, Tobias has eaten:
     \[
     34 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can divide $21.00 by 7 to find the cost of one bottle:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much one bottle of water costs. If 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we can divide $8.00 by 4 to find the cost of one bottle:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda:
\[ \text{Cost for 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]

And the cost for 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Cost for 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

First, we need to find out how much 16 bolts cost. Each bolt costs $0.03. So, we multiply the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:

\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

So, 16 bolts cost $0.48.

Next, we need to find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts. David starts with $12.48. We subtract the cost of the bolts from the amount of money he has:

\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts.

12.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find out how much she earns per hour, we divide the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked:

\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, Ella earns $11 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much she would earn if she works for 12 hours. We do this by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work:

\[ \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Therefore, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours.

   - Amy answers 80% of them correctly.
   - So, she gets \(10 \times 0.80 = 8\) questions right.
   - Each question is worth 1 point, so she earns \(8 \times 1 = 8\) points.

2. **True/False Questions:**
   - There are 20 true/false questions.
   - Amy answers 90% of them correctly.
   - So, she gets \(20 \times 0.90 = 18\) questions right.
   - Each question is worth 1 point, so she earns \(18 \times 1 = 18\) points.

3. **Long-Answer Questions:**
   - There are 5 long-answer questions.
   - Amy answers 60% of them correctly.
   - So, she gets \(5 \times 0.60 = 3\) questions right.

"To figure out how much Isaias spent on the chickens he took to the market, we need to do a few steps:

1. First, find out how many chickens he plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and wants to sell 3/5 of them. So, we calculate:
   \[ 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]
   Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

2. Next, we need to find out how much money he will make from selling these 180 chickens. Each chicken sells for $50, so:
   \[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]
   He will make $9000 from selling the chickens.

3. Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he spent on the chickens, we subtract the profit from the total money he will make:
   \[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias spent $7000 on the chickens he took to the market.

To find out how many glasses the boys sold together, we subtract the number of glasses Julie sold from the total:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, each boy sold 9 glasses.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy it for $2 per meter. So, we need to find out how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope.

To do this, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Sarah wants to use this money to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.50 per meter, and she wants to buy 20 meters of it. So, we need to find out how much the new rope will cost.

To do this, we multiply the length of the new rope by the price per meter:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope. We subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out how old she is now, we can subtract 10 from 18:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is 8 years old right now.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. If her current age is 8, then three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Kelly has left in her budget after buying her groceries.

First, we need to find out how much each item costs:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon for $10 in total. So, each pack of bacon costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, each packet of chicken costs:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, each pack of apples costs:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kellyâ€™s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Kelly has 5 dollars left in her budget."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus she does a 15-minute encore. The total time for the final concert is 65 minutes.

1. First, we need to find out how long the main part of the final concert is without the encore. We do this by subtracting the 15 minutes of the encore from the total concert time:
   \[
   65 - 15 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. The main part of the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. So, if we let \( x \) be the length of her usual concerts, then:
   \[
   2x = 50
   \]

3. To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{50}{2} = 25

Now, let's add them all up:
- Tuesday: 125 chimichangas
- Wednesday: 125 chimichangas
- Friday: 250 chimichangas

Total chimichangas = 125 + 125 + 250 = 500

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know the singer has 50 microphones. But 20% of these microphones won't fit on the stage. So, we need to find out how many microphones that is.

To find 20% of 50, we can do:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit on the stage. That means the number of microphones that can fit is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to arrange these 40 microphones in pairs. Each pair has 2 microphones, so we divide 40 by 2:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many plants are left after we take away the indoor plants:
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75

1. Ellen eats a salad, a yogurt, and two carrots every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt costs half as much as the salad, so the yogurt costs \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.
4. The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) dollars.
5. Ellen pays $11 in total for her food every day.
6. So, the cost of the two carrots is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) dollars.

   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 for all her work, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Earnings from Lemonade Sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carlâ€™s weight is 16 kg more than Martinâ€™s weight. So, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight:
   \[
   55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   Carlâ€™s weight is 71 kg.
3. Christianâ€™s weight is 8 kg more than Carlâ€™s weight. So, we add 8 kg to Carl's weight:
   \[
   71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   Christianâ€™s weight is 79 kg.
4. Harry is 5 kg less than Christianâ€™s weight. So, we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight:
   \[
   79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   Harryâ€™s weight is 74 kg.

So, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it out 10 times, and each time it's for 3 hours. So, we multiply:
   \[
   10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much money John makes from renting his car. He gets paid $25 for each hour. So, we multiply the total hours by the hourly rate:
   \[
   30 \text{ hours} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to find out how much profit John makes. Profit is the money he makes minus his car payment. His car payment is $500. So, we subtract:
   \[
   750 \text{ dollars} - 500 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, John's profit is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. So, before she bought more, she had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana. 

First, we need to find out how much more Anis rowed. We do this by calculating 1/5 of 50 miles:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Now, we add those 10 miles to the 50 miles Dijana rowed to find out how far Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to get the total distance:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance they rowed on that day is:
110 miles"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Susan made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we need to subtract those:

100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies

Now, Susan wants to divide the 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew gets, we divide 96 by 6:

96 cookies Ã· 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

So, each of Susanâ€™s nephews will get 16 cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Yesterday's Reading:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Today's Reading:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.
     - Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel didn't read any pages today, so he read 0 pages.

3. **Total Pages Read:**
   - Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages
   - Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages

4. **Difference in Pages Read:**
   - To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read.
   - \(28 - 13 = 15\)

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The pot has enough soup to fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl. That means they will use 2 adult bowls.
3. Since 1 adult bowl is the same as 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are the same as 4 child bowls.
4. So, Calvin and his wife will use 4 child bowls worth of soup for dinner.
5. The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the leftover soup is:
   - 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls
6. Calvin has two children, and each child will have one bowl at a meal. So, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
   - 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 times

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much William spent on the notebooks. Each notebook costs $1.50, and he bought 5 notebooks.
   \[
   5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
   \]
   So, he spent $7.50 on notebooks.

2. Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the ballpen. The ballpen costs $0.50, and he bought 1 ballpen.
   \[
   1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
   \]
   So, he spent $0.50 on the ballpen.

3. Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount he spent.
   \[
   7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much material Jo needs for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, she needs \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, we need to find out how much material Jo needs for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, she needs \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo needs 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up all the time he spends on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. And we know Duncan is 60 years old now.

First, let's find out how old Duncan was eight years ago:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

So, Duncan was 52 years old eight years ago.

Next, we know that Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's call Adam's age four years ago \( A - 4 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is 30 years old now.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we need to find out what twice 200 acres is and then add 100 acres to that.

First, we calculate twice 200 acres:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add 100 acres to 400 acres:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, we add the sizes of both farms to find the total:

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. In total, he threw 58 pieces of bologna. We know that there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's find out how many pieces of bologna Benny threw at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces of bologna} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Now, we know that the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. So, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces of bologna} - 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces of bologna}}{3 \text{ pieces of bologna per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:

Next, we need to find out how many tune-ups he needs. The car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per tune-up:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

1. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs $11.
2. **Cost of the balloons**: They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The balloons are sold at $0.5 for 2 balloons. So, for 12 balloons:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, and each tub costs $7.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To figure out how much money the class made from selling lollipops, we need to do a few steps:

1. First, find out how many lollipops all the students sold together. Since there are 30 students and each sold 10 lollipops:
   \[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

2. Next, calculate how much money they made from selling these lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8:
   \[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Then, figure out how much it cost to buy the lollipops. Each lollipop cost $0.5:
   \[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Finally, to find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, he has:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ rabbits}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find out how much water is in the tank:**
   - The pool has 10,000 gallons of water.
   - They fill the tank with half of the water from the pool.
   - So, the tank gets \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) gallons of water.

2. **Calculate how much water is used in 6 days:**
   - The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

3. **Snacks he has already bought:**
   - 2 tubs of popcorn: Each tub costs $8.
     - Total cost: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
   - 4 boxes of candy: Each box costs $2.
     - Total cost: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars

4. **Total money spent so far:**
   - Movies: \(50 + 56 = 106\) dollars
   - Snacks: \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars
   - Total: \(106 + 24 = 130\) dollars

5. **Money left:**
   - Initial budget: $150
   - Money spent: $130
   - Money left: \(150 - 130 = 20\) dollars

6. **Cost for the last night:**
   - It's a Friday, so the movie ticket costs $10.
   - He wants a tub of popcorn, which costs $8.
   - He wants a box of candy, which costs $2.
   - Total cost for the night: \(10 + 8 + 2 = 20\) dollars

7. **Can he afford the last night?**
   - Yes, he has exactly $20 left, which is enough for the movie, popcorn, and candy.

   600 \div 3 = 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories, we do:
   \[
   450 \div 3 = 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin}
   \]

Next, we need to find out the total calories for all the mini pastries Andrew baked.

3. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls. So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins. So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer:
\[
40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories}
\]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
85,000"
"Okay, let's figure out the average number of Junebugs Rita removes each day.

First, we need to add up all the Junebugs she removed from Monday to Friday:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 times 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 times 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add them all together:

39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

First, add 39 and 78:
39 + 78 = 117

Next, add 117 and 78:
117 + 78 = 195

Then, add 195 and 48:
195 + 48 = 243

Finally, add 243 and 57:
243 + 57 = 300

So, Rita removed a total of 300 Junebugs from Monday to Friday.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):

300 Ã· 5 = 60

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60.

\[
\boxed{60}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far the bus went. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far the car went. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

So, we add these together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she has now:
62 - 48 = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

14"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're working through a math problem in middle school.

We know three things:
1. The total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages.

Let's use some letters to make it easier:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( L \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be Jean's age.

From the problem, we can write these equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, we can use the second equation to replace \( L \) in the other equations:
\[ L = J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( L \) in the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Next, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) in the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now we know Jean's age is 20. Let's find Paul's age:
\[ L = J + 10 \]
\[ L = 20 + 10 \]
\[ L = 30 \]

Finally, let's find Peter's age:
\[ P = L + J \]
\[ P = 30 + 20 \]
\[ P = 50 \]

So, Peter is 50 years old.

\[
\boxed{50}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Maria has 1 water balloon for herself.
   - She gives each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons.
   - So, each friend gets 2 balloons, and there are 4 friends: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
   - Total balloons at the start: \(1 + 8 = 9\).

2. **Balloons from Mom:**
   - Maria's mom gives each person (Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons.
   - There are 5 people in total: \(1 + 4 = 5\).
   - Each person gets 3 more balloons: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

3. **Total Balloons:**
   - Total balloons at the start: 9
   - Total additional balloons from mom: 15
   - Total balloons after mom's addition: \(9 + 15 = 24\).

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
24"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff we have in total. We know that 10 people each donated 5 boxes, so:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

We also have 10 boxes of stuff already, so:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many tables we need to fit all 60 boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes, so:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

We already have 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables we need:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

So, we need 15 new tables.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Zoey's Total Distance:**
   - Zoey has 40 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 10 feet.
   - So, the total distance Zoey spits is \( 40 \times 10 = 400 \) feet.

2. **Sydney's Total Distance:**
   - Sydney has 35 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 12 feet.
   - So, the total distance Sydney spits is \( 35 \times 12 = 420 \) feet.

3. **Combined Total Distance:**
   - To find the combined total distance, we add Zoey's and Sydney's distances together.
   - Combined total distance = \( 400 + 420 = 820 \) feet.

4. **Average Total Distance:**
   - To find the average, we divide the combined total distance by the number of people (which is 2).
   - Average total distance = \( \frac{820}{2} = 410 \) feet.

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine can make in a month. We know that:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets every hour.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets every hour.
- Both machines run 24 hours a day for 30 days.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- Widgets per hour: 60
- Hours per day: 24
- Days: 30

Total widgets = 60 widgets/hour Ã— 24 hours/day Ã— 30 days
Total widgets = 60 Ã— 24 Ã— 30
Total widgets = 43,200

**WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Widgets per hour: 45
- Hours per day: 24
- Days: 30

Total widgets = 45 widgets/hour Ã— 24 hours/day Ã— 30 days
Total widgets = 45 Ã— 24 Ã— 30
Total widgets = 32,400

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue for each machine.

Each widget sells for $6.

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- Total widgets: 43,200
- Price per widget: $6

Total revenue = 43,200 widgets Ã— $6/widget
Total revenue = $259,200

**WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Total widgets: 32,400
- Price per widget: $6

Total revenue = 32,400 widgets Ã— $6/widget
Total revenue = $194,400

### Step 3: Find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

Difference in revenue = Total revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Total revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400
Difference in revenue = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. That's 17 hours in total. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For every hour after that, it's 70 pesos more.

First, let's figure out how many extra hours Cameron stays:
17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours

Now, let's calculate the cost for those extra hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost him 1600 pesos. To find out how much he saves, we subtract the cost of his actual stay from the 24-hour stay cost:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos.

250"
"Okay, let's figure out how much hay Nate needs for his livestock.

First, we need to find out how much hay each type of animal needs:
- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs. So, we first find out what twice the amount a goat needs is: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Then, we subtract 3 pounds: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total hay needed for the goats:
- There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay.
- Total hay for goats = \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total hay needed for the sheep:
- There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay.
- Total hay for sheep = \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total amount of hay:
- Total hay = 75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much money John made this week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John spends 50 dollars on gas. So, we subtract that from his total earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, John wants to put 100 dollars in the bank. So, we subtract that from the remaining money:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John buys 5 pencils, and each pencil costs 10 dollars. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

We subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, John wants to buy 25 dollar pens. To find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, John can buy 4 pens.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many letters Craig spelled. Craig spelled 20 words, and each word had 15 letters. So, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

So, Craig spelled 300 letters in total.

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother spelled. The problem says that Craig's brother spelled 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the number of letters Craig spelled:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

So, Craig's brother spelled 350 letters in total.

Now, to find the total number of letters both Craig and his brother spelled, we add the number of letters Craig spelled to the number of letters Craig's brother spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

- There are 7 rows for each school.
- There are 5 different schools.

First, we find out how many kids are in one school by multiplying the number of kids in a row by the number of rows:
\[ 8 \text{ kids/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ kids per school} \]

Next, we find out how many kids are in all 5 schools by multiplying the number of kids per school by the number of schools:
\[ 56 \text{ kids per school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ kids} \]

So, the total number of kids in the drill is 280.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has in total. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can get 100 bottles of apple juice. So, we multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles each coupon can get:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, we multiply the number of students by the number of bottles each student gets:

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has left:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15.
   - So, the total cost of the CDs before any discount is:
     \[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

2. James gets a 40% discount on the CDs.
   - To find the discount amount, we calculate 40% of $150:
     \[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

3. The total cost after the discount is:
   - Subtract the discount from the original total cost:
     \[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

4. James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40.
   - So, he gets $40 back from selling these 5 CDs.

5. To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid:
   - \[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops. We need to add up the money she gets from each type of crop.

First, let's look at the yams:
- Jen has 6 yams.
- Each yam sells for $1.50.
- So, the total from yams is 6 yams * $1.50/yam = $9.00.

Next, the sweet potatoes:
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato sells for $2.00.
- So, the total from sweet potatoes is 10 sweet potatoes * $2.00/sweet potato = $20.00.

Finally, the carrots:
- Jen has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot sells for $1.25.
- So, the total from carrots is 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.00.

Now, we add up all the totals:
- Total earnings = $9.00 (yams) + $20.00 (sweet potatoes) + $5.00 (carrots) = $34.00.

So, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, find out how far James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Next, figure out how long it takes him to swim the first part:**
   - James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Now, calculate how long he rests:**
   - He rests for half as long as he swam.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Determine the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Total distance is 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum is 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Find out his new swimming speed for the remaining distance:**
   - He swims at half his initial speed.
   - New speed is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Add up all the times to get the total time:**
   - Initial swimming time: 6 hours
   - Rest time: 3 hours

To find the commission for one copy:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much commission Cayley gets from selling the Wall Street Journal. Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15, and Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.

To find the commission for one copy:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. We also know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.

Let's use some simple math to find out how many points each person scored.

1. Let's say Azibo scored \( A \) points.
2. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
3. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

Now, we know the total points scored by all three is 45. So we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( A \):
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. That's a total of 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert those hours into minutes because we know how many reports Vince can staple in 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval. So, the total number of reports he can staple is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total Sleep Time:**
   - Kim usually goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours is the same as 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time Spent Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - To find out how long she was sleepwalking, we subtract the start time from the end time.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - She usually wakes up at 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - This means she lost 5 minutes of sleep.

4. **Total Time Lost:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time lost = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total Sleep Time on the Bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Total time lost: 28 minutes.
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

To find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, we need to subtract those 6 spoons from the 16 he originally had:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has left. We add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:
\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

34"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The hospital has 1000 beds in total.
2. Right now, 1/5 of the beds are occupied. So, we need to find out how many beds that is:
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
   \]
3. Each day, 50 new patients are admitted. Over 2 weeks (which is 14 days), the number of new patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{New patients} = 50 \times 14 = 700
   \]
4. After 2 weeks, the total number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the new patients:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900
   \]
5. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total number of beds:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100
   \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Robyn sends 16 emails a day.
2. Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. So, the number of non-work emails is:
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9
   \]
4. Two-thirds of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. So, the number of emails to family is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
5. This means the remaining emails are:
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]
6. One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1
   \]

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. So, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:

Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years old

Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can find Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

45"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. But Kelly thinks Courtney made a mistake and said there were 20% more people than there really were.

To find out how many people really attended, we need to figure out what 100% (the real number) is when 120% (Courtney's number) is 48.

First, let's set up the equation:
\[ 120\% \text{ of the real number} = 48 \]

We can write 120% as 1.20 (since 100% is 1.00, and 20% is 0.20).

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 1.20 \times \text{real number} = 48 \]

To find the real number, we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ \text{real number} = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ \text{real number} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
40"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Jason carried 2 balls.
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried half as many balls as Jason. That means Jeffrey carried 1 ball.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 4 balls.

Now, let's add up all the balls:
- Jordan: 4 balls
- Jason: 2 balls
- Jeffrey: 1 ball

Total number of balls = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

So, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **First Day:**
   - The pirates dug 10 holes.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They dug 13 more holes.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes because the pirates kept falling in.
   - So, the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

4. **Total Holes by the End of the Third Day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 6 holes
   - Total: \(10 + 13 + 6 = 29\) holes

5. **Total Holes by the End of the Fourth Day:**
   - The problem says that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
   - So, by the end of the fourth day, there were \(4 \times 10 = 40\) holes.

6. **Holes Dug on the Fourth Day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40 holes
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29 holes
   - Holes dug on the fourth day: \(40 - 29 = 11\) holes

So, the pirates dug \(\boxed{11}\) holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. So, together they got:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \text{ corn chips} \]

Next, we know that Collins got 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey. So, Collins got:
\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \text{ corn chips} \]

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins each got:
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \text{ corn chips} \]

So, the total number of corn chips is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. 

First, we need to find out what 50% of $400 is:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{50}{100} \times 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, 50% of $400 is $200.

Now, we add this to the original cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we're doing it in math class!

We have three friends: Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe. They caught a total of 339 Pokemon. We need to find out how many Pokemon Stan caught.

1. **Total Pokemon Caught:**
   \[
   \text{Alex} + \text{Stan} + \text{Adelwolfe} = 339
   \]

2. **Alex's Pokemon:**
   Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
   \[
   \text{Alex} = \text{Stan} + 5
   \]

3. **Stan's Pokemon:**
   Stan caught 13 less than 4 times the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.
   \[
   \text{Stan} = 4 \times \text{Adelwolfe} - 13
   \]

Let's use these equations to find out how many Pokemon each person caught.

First, let's call the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught \( A \).

So, Stan's Pokemon can be written as:
\[
\text{Stan} = 4A - 13
\]

And Alex's Pokemon can be written as:
\[
\text{Alex} = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8
\]

Now, we know the total number of Pokemon caught:
\[
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
\]
\[
9A - 21 = 339
\]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon. Let's find out how many Stan caught:
\[
\text{Stan} = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each episode of the show is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes in one episode. So, if one episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[ 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"Okay, let's figure out how far the bird traveled from her summer home to her winter home.

1. **First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:**
   - Distance = Time Ã— Speed
   - Distance = 10 hours Ã— 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

2. **Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:**
   - Distance = Time Ã— Speed
   - Distance = 2 hours Ã— 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

3. **Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:**
   - Distance = Time Ã— Speed
   - Distance = 5 hours Ã— 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Now, let's add up the distances the bird flew south and subtract the distance it flew north to find the total distance between the two homes.

- Total distance south: 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
- Distance north: 36 miles

Net distance south:
- 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"Okay, let's figure out how many brownies Greta had left over from her birthday.

1. Greta made 1 dozen brownies for herself. That's 12 brownies.
2. Her office gave her 1/2 a dozen brownies. That's 6 brownies.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party. That's 48 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. That's 18 brownies.

So, we need to subtract the brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

First, we need to know how long it takes to string each type of racquet:

1. **Synthetic Gut:**
   - Andy needs to string 3 racquets.
   - It takes him 15 minutes for each racquet.
   - So, for 3 racquets: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes.

2. **Polyester String:**
   - Andy needs to string 5 racquets.
   - It takes him 22 minutes for each racquet.
   - So, for 5 racquets: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes.

3. **Hybrid Set:**
   - Andy needs to string 4 racquets.
   - It takes him 18 minutes for each racquet.
   - So, for 4 racquets: \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
\[ 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \] minutes.

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

John is buying phones for himself, his wife, and his two kids. That's a total of 4 phones. Each phone costs $600, but the phones after the first two are half price.

1. The first phone costs $600.
2. The second phone also costs $600.
3. The third phone is half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.
4. The fourth phone is also half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600
- Third phone: $300
- Fourth phone: $300

Total cost: $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Now, to find the total number of players on both teams, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

"To figure out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to find out how long the fence will be all the way around. This is called the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Robert's garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. So, we plug in the numbers:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

   \]
3. After giving away 4 boxes, she has:
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}

4. She kept 1/4 of the 8 boxes. So, she kept:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes}
   \]
5. The number of boxes she sold is:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes}
   \]
6. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is:

First, we need to find out how much all the books cost together. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the cookbook costs $8. So, we add these up:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39.

Next, we need to see how much more money Tyler needs. He has already saved $14. So, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the books.

Tyler earns $5 for each hour he works. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

First, let's find out how many boxes of each item Sunny sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's add up the total number of boxes sold over the two days.

**Total gingerbread:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sunny made from selling each type of item.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- 25 boxes * $6/box = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

1. **Emil's Age:**
   - Emil is 19 years old now.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Emil's Dad's Age:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - So, Emil's dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old when Emil is 24.
   - Since this is 5 years from now, Emil's dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

3. **Emil's Brother's Age:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - So, Emil's brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old when Emil is 24.
   - Since this is 5 years from now, Emil's brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

4. **Sum of Their Ages:**
   - Emil's dad is 43 years old.

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players leave:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]
So, there are 24 students left.

Now, out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find 25% of 24, we do:
\[ 24 \times 0.25 = 6 \]
So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Pat will need to spend to fill up her flower bed.

1. **First, we need to know how much space each plant and the space between them will take up:**
   - Each plant is 1 foot wide.
   - Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet of space between each plant.
   - So, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111-foot flower bed:**
   - We divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the space between it will take up.
   - 111 feet Ã· 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4
   - Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

3. **Now, we need to figure out how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already has 17 plants.
   - She needs 44 plants in total.
   - So, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

4. **Finally, we calculate the total cost of the plants:**

  \[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, and Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. So, the cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
  \[ 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00 \]

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost for one basket:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Katherine has 5 baskets to fill, so we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

So, Katherine will spend \$70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
  \[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
  \[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the amount of soil left is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, they can plant 3 roses.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money Jessica saves each month for fancy shoes. She makes $2,000 a month and sets aside 25% of that. 

To find 25% of $2,000, we do:
\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica saves $500 each month for fancy shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Jessica saves $6,000 in a year.

Now, we need to figure out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000, so:
\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp in one minute. So, to find out how many minutes it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:

\[ 90 \div 6 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute sessions she needs to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30:

\[ 90 \div 30 = 3 \]

Since each session takes 10 minutes, we multiply 3 by 10:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, the air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours:**
   - On low, it cools the room by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 3 hours, it cools the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Next, the air conditioner runs on high for 4 hours:**
   - On high, it cools the room by 3 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 4 hours, it cools the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Then, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours:**
   - When the air conditioner is off, the room warms up by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

4. **Now, let's find the total change in temperature:**
   - The room cooled down by 6 degrees on low.
   - The room cooled down by 12 degrees on high.
   - The room warmed up by 4 degrees when the air conditioner was off.
   - So, the total change in temperature is \(6 + 12 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Dad's Age When He Saw the Comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet a Second Time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times as old as his dad was when he saw the comet.
   - So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Time Between Comet Sightings:**
   - The comet comes back every 75 years.

4. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet comes back every 75 years, then he must have seen it for the first time 75 years earlier.
   - So, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the answer is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many checks Buford writes in a year.

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check every month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so:
   - 1 check/month Ã— 12 months = 12 checks

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford also writes 1 check every month for the gas bill. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so:
   - 1 check/month Ã— 12 months = 12 checks

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks every month for the church. There are 12 months in a year, so:
   - 2 checks/month Ã— 12 months = 24 checks

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check every quarter for the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so:
   - 1 check/quarter Ã— 4 quarters = 4 checks

Now, let's add up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12 checks
- Gas bill checks: 12 checks
- Church checks: 24 checks
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4 checks

Total checks per year:
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. The first plane makes a bunch of trips. We don't know how many yet, so let's call that number \( F \).

2. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its trips. So, if \( F \) is the total number of trips, then the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

3. The remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany. So, the number of trips to France and the number of trips to Germany are each \( \frac{1}{8}F \) (because \( \frac{1}{4}F \) is split equally between the two).

4. The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these 44 trips are only half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane:
   \[
   F = 2 \times 44 = 88
   \]

5. Now, we know the first plane makes 88 trips in total. To find out how many trips it makes to France, we use the fraction we found earlier:
   \[
   \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - So, Chikote howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined.
   - So, Igneous howls for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Total Howl Time:**
   - Now, we add up the howl times of all three wolves.
   - Total howl time = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - So, 120 seconds = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

1. Adam's mom gave him $6.
2. His dad gave him twice as much as his mom, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. So, the total amount of money Adam got from his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The trousers cost $30.
5. To find out how much Adam had to pay from his own savings, we subtract the money he got from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

So, Adam had to contribute 12 dollars from his savings.

"Okay, let's figure out Wilfred's age step by step.

1. We know the total age of all four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's find the average age of the group. The average age is the total age divided by the number of children:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice this average age:
\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we know:
- Akbar: 3 years old
- Alessandro: 4 years old
- Helene: 10 years old

Let's add up the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:
\[ 3 + 4 + 10 = 17 \]

The total age of all four children is 20, so Wilfred's age is:
\[ 20 - 17 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

Next, the bride gave half of these cookies to the church. So, we need to find half of 1500:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in math class.

We have a family of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon needs to be divided so that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

1. Let's say each kid's slice is \( x \) (a small piece).
2. Each adult's slice will then be \( 2x \) (twice as big as a kid's slice).

Now, let's figure out how many slices we have in total:
- The 4 kids will have \( 4 \times x = 4x \) in total.
- The 2 adults will have \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) in total.

So, the total amount of watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

1. **Total number of students**: The school has 3000 students.

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - So, the number of students over 16 is \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \).

3. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.
   - So, the number of male students over 16 is \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \).

4. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The rest of the students over 16 are female.
   - So, the number of female students over 16 is \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \).

5. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The other half of the students are under 16 years old.

2. **Total for the First Day:**
   - Add Wanda's and Ms. B's amounts:
     \[
     \text{Total first day} = 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she did on the first day. So:
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4,500 = 3,000 \text{ gallons}

### Step 1: Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours
- The power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours.
- If we let \( x \) be the charge at the start of these 3 hours, then after 3 hours, the charge left is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
- We know that after these 3 hours, the charge left is 28%.
- So, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

Let's calculate \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[
(0.93)^3 = 0.93 \times 0.93 \times 0.93 \approx 0.804
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x \times 0.804 = 0.28
\]
\[
x = \frac{0.28}{0.804} \approx 0.348
\]

So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was about 34.8%.

### Step 2: Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours
- The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours.
- If we let \( y \) be the charge at the start of these 5 hours, then after 5 hours, the charge left is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
- We know that after these 5 hours, the charge left is 34.8%.
- So, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

Let's calculate \( (0.91)^5 \):
\[
(0.91)^5 = 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \approx 0.590
\]

Now, we can solve for \( y \):
\[
y \times 0.590 = 0.348
\]
\[
y = \frac{0.348}{0.590} \approx 0.589
\]

So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was about 58.9%.

### Final Answer
The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

58.9%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find out how much Janet needs for the down payment:**
   - The car costs $10,000.
   - Janet wants to save 20% of that for the down payment.
   - So, we need to find 20% of $10,000.
   - \( 20\% \) of $10,000 is \( 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \).

2. **Calculate how much Janet earns in one hour:**
   - Janet makes $10 an hour from her wages.
   - She also makes $15 an hour from tips.
   - So, in one hour, she earns \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) dollars.

3. **Find out how much Janet earns in one week:**
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   - So, in one week, she earns \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \) dollars.

4. **Determine how many weeks Janet needs to save $2000:**
   - Janet needs to save $2000.
   - She saves $1000 each week.
   - So, the number of weeks she needs is \( \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \).

Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. Here's what he's already bought:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each
- 4 pears at $0.50 each
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each
- 5 apples at $0.75 each

First, let's calculate how much he spent on each type of fruit:

- Peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:

$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy, we divide the money he has left by the cost of one plum:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Anne has a box with 15 packs of sweets. Each pack has 60 pieces. She keeps 2 packs for herself and gives the rest to her 10 friends.

1. Calculate the number of packs Anne gives away:
   \[
   15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of pieces in the 13 packs:
   \[
   13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. Divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend gets:
   \[
   \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend}
   \]

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"Okay, let's figure out the price of carrots after three years if the price goes up by 5% each year.

1. First, we need to find out what 5% of the original price is. The original price is $120.
   - 5% of $120 is \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \).

2. Each year, the price increases by $6. So, we need to calculate the price for each year:
   - After the first year: \( 120 + 6 = 126 \)
   - After the second year: \( 126 + 6.30 = 132.30 \) (because 5% of 126 is \( 126 \times 0.05 = 6.30 \))
   - After the third year: \( 132.30 + 6.615 = 138.915 \) (because 5% of 132.30 is \( 132.30 \times 0.05 = 6.615 \))

3. Now, we round 138.915 to the nearest whole number:
   - 138.915 rounds to 139.

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put in each album. She uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums. So, we divide 72 by 8:
   \[
   72 \div 8 = 9
   \]
   So, each album has 9 pictures.

2. Now, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies. Since each album has 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:
   \[
   3 \times 9 = 27
   \]

3. Next, we know that 2 of the albums are portraits. So, the total number of portraits is:
   \[
   2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

4. To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and the number of portraits:
   \[
   27 + 18 = 45
   \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is 45.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. So, if he reads 18 pages, we need to find out how many sets of 3 pages are in 18 pages.

18 pages Ã· 3 pages per set = 6 sets

Since each set takes 10 minutes to read, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set:

6 sets Ã— 10 minutes per set = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early. So, we subtract 24 from 100:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. Then, 15 guests checked out late. We subtract 15 from 76:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, we add 30 to 61:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner. We add 7 to 91:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. So, he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas on Friday.

Now, let's add up all the bananas he picked:
- Wednesday: 4 bananas
- Thursday: 6 bananas
- Friday: 12 bananas

Total bananas = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find the number of easy questions:**
   - The quiz has 60 questions in total.
   - 40% of the questions are easy.
   - To find 40% of 60, we multiply 60 by 0.40:
     \[
     60 \times 0.40 = 24
     \]
   - So, there are 24 easy questions.

2. **Find the number of average and difficult questions:**
   - The rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions.
   - The number of remaining questions is:
     \[
     60 - 24 = 36
     \]
   - Since these 36 questions are divided equally:
     \[
     36 \div 2 = 18
     \]
   - So, there are 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

3. **Calculate the number of questions Aries will get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - To find 75% of 24, we multiply 24 by 0.75:
     \[
     24 \times 0.75 = 18
     \]
   - So, Aries gets 18 easy questions correct.

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct.
   - To find half of 18, we divide 18 by 2:
     \[
     18 \div 2 = 9
     \]
   - So, Aries gets 9 average questions correct.

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct.
   - To find half of 18, we divide 18 by 2:
     \[
     18 \div 2 = 9
     \]
   - So, Aries gets 9 difficult questions correct.

4. **Add up the total number of questions Aries will get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Easy questions correct + Average questions correct + Difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

So, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold \( x \) large stuffed animals. This means she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one. So, a large stuffed animal costs \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Now, let's set up the equation for the total money she made. The total money from selling small stuffed animals is \( 4 \times 2x \), and the total money from selling large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times x \). The total money she made is $120.

So, the equation is:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \):
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches the family eats each day:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches.

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

- She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each. So, the money from cupcakes is:
  \[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money from cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the money she gave to her sisters. She gave $10 to each of her two sisters, so:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Suzanne has \(\boxed{300}\) dollars left from her earnings."

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \(24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds.

2. **Next, calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds in a day, then 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds in a day.

3. **Finally, find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds in one day, then in 30 days they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to see how much each sandwich costs in the packages we know about.

1. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3. So, each sandwich costs:
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. So, each sandwich costs:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, each sandwich in the third package should also cost $1.5.

Now, we need to find out how much 8 sandwiches will cost:
\[
8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Sally had 25 red balloons. A gust of wind made 40% of them burst. To find out how many burst, we do:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
So, 10 red balloons burst. That means she has:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]
red balloons left.

Next, Sally had 12 yellow balloons. She accidentally let go of half of them. To find out how many she let go, we do:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
So, she let go of 6 yellow balloons. That means she has:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]
yellow balloons left.

Sally also had 7 green balloons, and none of them burst or were let go, so she still has 7 green balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree and added 75% of them to her bunch. To find out how many she added, we do:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, she added 6 blue balloons to her bunch.

Now, let's add up all the balloons she has left:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out the chances that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. There are a few different ways this can happen:

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
   - So, the chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework because of a substitute is 50%.

2. **Normal Teacher Gives an Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher comes (which is a 50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
   - To find the combined chance, we multiply the two probabilities: 50% * 40% = 20%.

3. **Normal Teacher Gives a Personal Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension (which is a 60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his homework.
   - To find the combined chance, we multiply the probabilities: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, we add up all the chances that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

To find the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we subtract the total chance he won't have to turn it in from 100%:
100% - 76% = 24%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people. We need to subtract the seats for the graduates and the faculty:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

So, there are 4750 seats left for friends and family.

Next, we need to divide these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate gets:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Melissa earned. She gets paid $15 each day for 3 days. So, we multiply $15 by 3 days:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to figure out how much Melissa spent on parking. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days. So, we multiply $3 by 3 days:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total parking cost from the total money she earned to find out how much she has left:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses. We divide the total money she has left by the total number of hours she worked:

1. **Find out how many soda bottles Richard will use:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He puts a bottle every 3 feet.
   - So, the number of bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \).

2. **Calculate the time to move between the bottles:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - He has to move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).
   - So, the total time to move between the bottles is \( 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds} \).

3. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he doesn't need extra time to get to it.
   - The time to drop the candy in the first bottle is 0 seconds.

4. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop the candy in the first bottle

   - He gets $50,000 in loans each year.
   - So, the total loans he gets are: \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the income Jim lost while in school:**
   - Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 a year.
   - He didn't work for 4 years while in college.

   - So, his new income is: \( 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \) dollars per year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total amount:**
   - Jim needs to earn $300,000.
   - He earns $75,000 per year.
   - So, the time it will take is: \( \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \) years.

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know the size of the bed. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.

Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

For the length:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

For the width:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we need to find out how much fabric is needed for one piece. We do this by multiplying the length by the width:
8 feet (length) Ã— 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet Ã— 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

160"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters.
   - First, find one-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Then, add 17 to 85: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - First, find twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Then, add 5 to 204: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Add the letters delivered on each day: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

So, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday.

736"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the chicken salad will cost. There are 10 people who want chicken salad, and it costs $6.50 per person. So, we multiply 10 by $6.50:

10 * $6.50 = $65.00

Next, we need to find out how much the pasta salad will cost. There are 6 people who want pasta salad, and it costs $6.00 per person. So, we multiply 6 by $6.00:

6 * $6.00 = $36.00

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together to get the total cost:

$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice what he lost in the first race.
   - Twice what he lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - So, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times what he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race.
   - So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount he lost:
- First race: $5
- Third race: $16.5
- Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\) dollars

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average loss: \(21.5 \div 3 = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss is $7.17.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many cities there are in total in South America. We know there are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. So, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country:
   \[
   26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many people live in all these cities. We know that each city has 1000 people. So, we multiply the number of cities by the number of people in each city:
   \[
   130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people}
   \]

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how tall Xavier is now. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 4 feet is 48 inches. So, Xavier's new height is:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Next, we need to know how tall Cole is now. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's new height is:
   \[
   50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's new heights. We subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height:
   \[
   52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch}
   \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavierâ€™s height now is 1 inch.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

We have three people sharing $1920. Let's call the amount the first person gets \( x \).

The second person gets $80 more than the first person, so the second person gets \( x + 80 \).

The third person gets twice what the second person gets, so the third person gets \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we add up all the amounts to get the total of $1920:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, let's simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \). We do this by subtracting 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person gets \( \boxed{420} \) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find out how many days the painters worked:**
   - They worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - So, 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. **Determine how many hours they worked each day:**
   - They worked 3/8 of a day each day.
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - So, 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours each day.

3. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - They worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - So, 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

4. **Find out how many hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - So, 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter.

So, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls in three sets. We need to find out how many he got in the first set.

1. Let's say Rory retrieved \( x \) balls in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he got \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he got \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of balls:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To make it easier, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying everything by 2:

\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, let's find out how many he got in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"Okay, let's figure out the price of Ben's car in 2010. 

First, we need to know how much the car loses in value each year. The car loses 21% of its value every year. 

To find out how much the car is worth after one year, we multiply the original price by 79% (which is 100% - 21%).

So, after one year:
\[ 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

Next, we do the same thing for the second year:
\[ 15800 \times 0.79 = 12482 \]

And for the third year:
\[ 12482 \times 0.79 = 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is about $9860.78.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 50 books in total.
2. Half of these books are in English. So, we need to find half of 50:
   \[

   \]
   So, there are 25 English books.
3. Next, 10% of the books are in German. To find 10% of 50:
   \[
   50 \times 0.10 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 German books.
4. Now, we need to find out how many books are in Spanish. We do this by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
   \[
   50 - 25 - 5 = 20
   \]

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

Next, we need to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive. The total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. We subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

\[ 1955 - 1300 = 655 \, \text{kilometers} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

   \]

2. Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon, so:
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons}

   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (which is 100 people) get on the train. So, we subtract 50 and then add 100:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off the train. So, we subtract 80 from 190:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
110

"Okay, let's figure out how much Alison spent on her athletic gear.

1. **Tank top**: She bought a tank top for $10.
2. **Running shorts**: The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top. So, $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis shoes**: The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. So, $48 / 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic socks**: The socks cost $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off. So, $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on her athletic gear.

"To figure out how much it will cost to put new tiles on the kitchen floor, we need to do a few simple steps.

First, we need to know how many tiles we need. Since each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, it covers 1 square foot. The kitchen floor is 200 square feet, so we need 200 tiles.

Next, we need to find out how much all the tiles will cost. Each tile costs $12. So, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, it will cost $2400 to renovate the kitchen floor.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much more James has to pay each month because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it's 60% more after the accident.
2. To find 60% of $120, we multiply 120 by 0.60:
   \[
   120 \times 0.60 = 72
   \]
3. So, the extra cost each month is $72.
4. Now, we add this extra cost to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
   \[
   120 + 72 = 192
   \]
5. To find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   192 \times 12 = 2304

1. **Weekly Laundry:**
   - Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.

2. **Twin Sheets:**
   - Greg needs to wash 4 twin sets each week.
   - Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he will need to do:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets}
     \]

3. **King Sheets:**
   - Greg needs to wash 1 king set each week.
   - Since the machine can wash 1 king set at a time, he will need to do:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load for king sheets}
     \]

4. **Total Weekly Loads:**
   - Adding the loads for twin sheets and king sheets:
     \[
     2 \text{ loads for twin sheets} + 1 \text{ load for king sheets} = 3 \text{ loads per week}

   - Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies on Sunday:**
   - They watch half as many movies on Sunday as they do on Saturday.
   - Half of 4 is 2, so they watch 2 movies on Sunday.

3. **Total movies in one weekend:**
   - On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
   - So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

4. **Total movies in 4 weeks:**

2. Next, we need to find out how much food the cats eat in one day. Since they are fed twice a day, we multiply the amount of food per feeding by 2:
   \[
   180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day}
   \]

3. Now, we have 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount of food the cats eat per day:

Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The whole meal took 98 minutes to make. We need to find out how long Betsy's part took.

1. Let's say Donovan's part took \( D \) minutes.
2. Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.
3. The total time for both parts is 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   D + (D + 18) = 98
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2D + 18 = 98
   \]
5. Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):
   \[
   2D = 80
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):
   \[
   D = 40
   \]
7. Now, we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, so:

\[ 80 \times 0.20 = 16 \]

So, 16 emails don't need a response. That means the rest do need a response:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

pizzas left.

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club. So, they ordered:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
pizzas. They ate 80% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we do:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. That means they have:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

1. **Number of Big Coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he's sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons}
   \]

2. **Cost of Mailing Small Coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, for 700 small coupons:
   \[
   700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}

Sidney then ordered 3 more sandwiches, so now Sidney has:
3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches

Each sandwich has 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 6 sandwiches is:
6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

So, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

24"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Total Number of Trucks Dispatched:**
   Mr. Hezekiah sent out 20 trucks to deliver fertiliser.

2. **Trucks with Mechanical Failures:**
   A quarter of the trucks had problems. To find out how many that is, we divide 20 by 4:
   \[
   20 \div 4 = 5
   \]
   So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures.

3. **Trucks That Delivered:**
   To find out how many trucks actually made it to the farmers, we subtract the number of trucks with problems from the total number of trucks:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]
   So, 15 trucks delivered the fertiliser.

4. **Total Fertiliser Delivered:**
   Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find out how much fertiliser was delivered, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the amount of fertiliser each truck carried:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 tons of fertiliser were delivered to the farmers.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **How much butter does Dennis need?**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

2. **What is the promotion at the grocery store?**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every pound of butter you buy at full price, the next pound is half price.

3. **How much does butter cost?**
   - Butter costs $4.00 per pound.

4. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - For the first pound, he pays $4.00.
   - For the second pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - For the third pound, he pays $4.00.
   - For the fourth pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - For the fifth pound, he pays $4.00.
   - For the sixth pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

5. **Add up the costs:**
   - First pound: $4.00
   - Second pound: $2.00
   - Third pound: $4.00
   - Fourth pound: $2.00
   - Fifth pound: $4.00
   - Sixth pound: $2.00

   Total cost = $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

So, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter.

\[
\boxed{18.00}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many people Kayla invited in total:
- She invited 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of people she invited is:
25 + 7 + 13 = 45

But 4 people said they couldn't come, so the number of people who will actually come is:
45 - 4 = 41

The theater has a base fee of $125 for the first 20 people. For each additional person, it costs $6 more.

Since 41 people are coming, we need to find out how many more people there are beyond the first 20:
41 - 20 = 21

So, for these 21 extra people, the cost is:
21 * 6 = 126

Now, we add the base fee to the extra cost:
125 + 126 = 251

So, the total cost for the party is:
251"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Maggie had $60 and spent a quarter of it. A quarter is the same as 1/4. So, we need to find out what 1/4 of $60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Maggie spent $15, so she has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also had $60 and spent one-third of it. One-third is the same as 1/3. So, we need to find out what 1/3 of $60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Riza spent $20, so she has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, we add the money Maggie and Riza have left:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, together, they have $85 left.

85"
"Okay, let's figure out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day.

1. **Total bananas for the week:**
   - Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.

2. **First monkey's daily consumption:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - So, in a week, the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.

3. **Second monkey's daily consumption:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - So, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - In a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.

4. **Total consumption of the first and second monkeys for the week:**
   - The first and second monkeys together eat \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas in a week.

5. **Total consumption of the third monkey for the week:**
   - The total number of bananas is 315.
   - The third monkey eats the remaining bananas: \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas in a week.

6. **Daily consumption of the third monkey:**
   - The third monkey eats \(147 \div 7 = 21\) bananas each day.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which means he did 250 pieces. Then, he finished another whole 500-piece puzzle. So, we need to add the pieces from both puzzles together:

250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces

So, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

750"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Cost of the Roses:**
   - A dozen roses (12 roses) cost $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 roses plus 3 more roses.
   - The 12 roses cost $15.
   - Each extra rose costs $2, so 3 extra roses cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - So, the total cost for 15 roses is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

2. **Money Jenny Has:**
   - Jenny has 5 five-dollar bills.
   - The total amount of money she has is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

3. **Change Jenny Receives:**
   - The change is the total amount of money she has minus the cost of the roses.
   - The change is \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Converting Change to Quarters:**
   - 1 dollar is equal to 4 quarters.
   - So, 4 dollars is equal to \(4 \times 4 = 16\) quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Terry makes by adding up the sales from the milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.

First, we calculate the money from the milkshakes:
- Terry sells 6 milkshakes.
- Each milkshake costs $5.50.
- So, the total from milkshakes is 6 times $5.50, which is $33.00.

Next, we calculate the money from the burger platters:
- Terry sells 9 burger platters.
- Each burger platter costs $11.
- So, the total from burger platters is 9 times $11, which is $99.00.

Finally, we calculate the money from the sodas:
- Terry sells 20 sodas.
- Each soda costs $1.50.
- So, the total from sodas is 20 times $1.50, which is $30.00.

Now, we add up all the totals:
- Total from milkshakes: $33.00
- Total from burger platters: $99.00
- Total from sodas: $30.00

Adding these together:
$33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

So, Terry makes a total of $162.00.

"Okay, let's figure out how long Paul has to wait for his train. We'll break it down step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - The first train arrives in 10 minutes.
   - It stays at the station for 20 minutes.
   - So, the first train leaves 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - So, the second train leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 145 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, we need to find out how many toothpicks she has saved so far. We can do this by multiplying the number of toothpicks she saves each week by the number of weeks she has been saving:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Now, Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks for her sculpture. We need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks she needs to save 80 more toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - To find 75% of $2000, we multiply: \( 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \).
   - So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

2. **Find out how much Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid.
   - To find 120% of $1500, we multiply: \( 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \).
   - So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for $1800.

3. **Calculate the discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers' friend paid $1800.
   - The discount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid: \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \).

4. **Find the percentage discount:**
   - To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and then multiply by 100:
   - \( \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \).

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

10%"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many seconds are in 4 hours. We know that:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds

So, to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours:
- 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 seconds
- 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- 240 * 60 = 14,400 seconds

Next, we know that one spring creates 1 jellyfish every second. So, in 14,400 seconds, one spring would create 14,400 jellyfish.

Now, if we have 5 springs, each creating jellyfish at the same rate, we need to multiply the number of jellyfish one spring creates by 5:
- 14,400 jellyfish * 5 = 72,000 jellyfish

So, 5 springs would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Binkie's score is 90. The problem says that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. So, we need to do two things:

1. First, we find out what twice Binkie's score is:
   \[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

2. Then, we add 15 to that number to get Frankie's score:
   \[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Distance to the store**: The store is 4 miles away from James's home.
2. **Halfway to the store**: Half of 4 miles is 2 miles.
3. **Walking back home**: James walks 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home. So, he walks 2 + 2 = 4 miles to get back home.
4. **Walking to the store again**: After returning home, James walks the full 4 miles to the store.

Now, let's add up all the miles James walked:
- 4 miles (to the halfway point and back home)
- 4 miles (from home to the store)

Total distance walked: 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time it took James is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny got. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, we multiply:

10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas

Next, let's see how much it would cost if she bought each banana separately. Each banana costs $0.80, so:

40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Now, let's find out how much it cost her to buy the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so:

10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence to split. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. We need to find out how much fence Sam gets.

1. Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of fence.
2. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of fence.
3. The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   S + (S + 60) = 100
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2S + 60 = 100
   \]
5. Subtract 60 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
   \[
   2S = 40
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 20
   \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

First, we need to find out how much the crocodile grows each year. If the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can divide 8 inches by 4 years to find the growth per year:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, we want to know how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years. Since it grows 2 inches each year, we can multiply 2 inches by 13 years:
\[ 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Marcel made from selling bikes in one month. Here's what we know:

- Marcel sells three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking.
- The price of an MTB is $500.
- The price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, so it's $250.
- The price of a Trekking bike is $450.
- Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes.
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes.
- The rest were MTB bikes.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold:

1. **Trekking bikes**:
   - Half of 300 bikes is \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.

2. **BMX bikes**:
   - 15% of 300 bikes is \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.

3. **MTB bikes**:
   - The rest of the bikes are MTB bikes.
   - Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes = MTB bikes.
   - \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate how much Marcel earned from each type of bike:

1. **Earnings from MTB bikes**:
   - \( 105 \) MTB bikes \(\times\) $500 each = \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars.

2. **Earnings from BMX bikes**:
   - \( 45 \) BMX bikes \(\times\) $250 each = \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars.

3. **Earnings from Trekking bikes**:
   - \( 150 \) Trekking bikes \(\times\) $450 each = \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all the earnings to find the total:

- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB + Earnings from BMX + Earnings from Trekking
- Total earnings = \( 52,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = 131,250 \) dollars.

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many bales the farmer makes in one hour. The farmer makes 5 bales each hour.
2. Next, we need to know how many bales the truck picks up in one hour. The truck picks up 3 bales each hour.
3. Now, let's find out how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours. We multiply the number of bales made per hour by the number of hours:
   \[
   5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}
   \]
4. Then, let's find out how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours. We multiply the number of bales picked up per hour by the number of hours:
   \[
   3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}
   \]
5. Finally, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
   \[
   30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales}
   \]

So, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many classes John has in a week. He has 6 periods a day, plus 2 extra classes, so that's 8 classes a day. He goes to school 5 days a week, so:

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ classes/week} \]

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time he spends in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ classes/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, John spends an extra 1/16 of his weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday. So, we need to find out what 1/16 of 1600 minutes is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

He spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, so:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra learning time to the regular class time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends learning each week, we divide the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find the starting height:**
   - Each floor is 24 feet high.
   - Nathan drops the ball from the third floor, so the starting height is \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) feet.

2. **First bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height.
   - So, after the first bounce, the height is \( 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \) feet.

3. **Second bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height after the first bounce.
   - So, after the second bounce, the height is \( 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \) feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, if the triceratops weighed \( x \) kilograms, the T-Rex ate \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms, and there was \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms left.

2. Then, the velociraptors came and ate half of what was left. So, they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means there was \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms left after the velociraptors.

3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms. So, \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

4. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to paint the room. First, we need to find out how much area we need to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's add up the total area of all four walls:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many gallons of paint we need. One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. So, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much it will cost. Each gallon of paint costs $12. So, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, it will cost $144 to paint the room.

   - So, now there are 11 sodas left.
   - 3 of these are still shaken, and 8 are unshaken.

3. **After Ellen's Brother Takes Some Sodas:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Now, there are 8 sodas left.
   - 2 of these are shaken, and 6 are unshaken.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - We need to find the chance that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda.
   - There are 2 shaken sodas out of 8 total sodas.
   - The probability is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:
     \[
     \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - To convert the fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%
     \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we have two trains. One train is going 60 miles per hour, and the other train is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. They are going in opposite directions.

Now, we need to find out how far each train travels in 3 hours.

For the first train:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 3 hours
- Distance = Speed Ã— Time = 60 miles/hour Ã— 3 hours = 180 miles

For the second train:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 3 hours
- Distance = Speed Ã— Time = 30 miles/hour Ã— 3 hours = 90 miles

Since the trains are going in opposite directions, we add the distances they travel to find out how far apart they are:
- Total distance apart = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many days there are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, we add these together:

31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

Next, Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days that is, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

So, Billy takes 10 days off. That means he works the rest of the days:

50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Now, Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day. So, each day he helps:

2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Finally, to find out how many people he helps in total, we multiply the number of people he helps each day by the number of days he works:

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

So, Billy helps 240 people.

240"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many people the buses can carry. There are 12 buses, and each bus can carry 35 people. So, we multiply:

12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, we need to find out how many people the cars can carry. There are 20 cars, and each car can carry 3 people. So, we multiply:

20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the number of people the buses can carry to the number of people the cars can carry to get the total number of people:

420 people + 60 people = 480 people

So, the total number of people who were inside the church is 480.

480"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we subtract 4 from 24:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20
   \]
   So, Martha is 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to 20:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30
   \]
   So, Jeff is 30 years old.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To figure out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to do a bit of math.

First, let's find out how long it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The biggest slide is 300 feet long.
- People slide down at 60 feet per minute.
- To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 300 feet Ã· 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.
- People slide down at 80 feet per minute.
- To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 240 feet Ã· 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
- Time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes
- Time for the second biggest slide: 3 minutes
- Difference in time: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Lunch Time:**
   - Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch break each day.

2. **Break Time:**
   - Bobby takes 2 breaks, and each break is 15 minutes.
   - So, the total break time per day is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.

3. **Total Time per Day:**
   - Total time for lunch and breaks each day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.
   - 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour.

4. **Total Time for 5 Days:**
   - If Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks, then over 5 days, he spends 5 * 1 hour = 5 hours.

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Amber ran 8 miles. 

Next, we need to find out how far Micah ran. The problem says Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. So, we multiply 8 miles by 3.5:
\[ 8 \times 3.5 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles that Amber and Micah ran together:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance run by all three is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:
\[ 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Sheila first charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we need to subtract that from the $85.00.
   - $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00.
   - The discount on the frying pan is 20% of $20.00, which is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.
   - So, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.
   - The discount on the towels is 10% of $30.00, which is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.
   - So, the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance after the return.
   - $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish in the tank are large. This means if we have \( T \) jellyfish in total, then the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

Next, we're told that a third of these large jellyfish change color from green to blue when the UV light is on. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( \frac{T}{5} \), which is \( \frac{T}{15} \).

We also know that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

1. **Figure out how much money Lauren needs each year in retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary.
   - Her current salary is $100,000.
   - So, 40% of $100,000 is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \).

2. **Calculate the total amount Lauren needs for 20 years of retirement:**
   - She needs $40,000 each year.
   - For 20 years, she needs \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \).

3. **Determine how much Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her salary.
   - Her salary is $100,000.
   - So, 20% of $100,000 is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \).

4. **Find out how many years it will take to save $800,000:**
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - To save $800,000, she needs \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon.
2. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   100 \div 4 = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long.

3. Now, each of these 25 cm parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5 \text{ cm}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

We know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and there are 240 boys. We need to find out how many students are in the school in total.

First, let's set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times \text{Total Students} = 240 \]

To find the total number of students, we divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ \text{Total Students} = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ \text{Total Students} = 600 \]

So, there are 600 students in total in the school.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. Since the total number of students is 600 and there are 240 boys, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of Girls} = 600 - 240 \]

Let's do the subtraction:
\[ \text{Number of Girls} = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360.

To find the total height:
- For the 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
- For the 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches

Now, add these together to get the total height:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches

Next, we need to find the average height. To do this, we divide the total height by the number of women:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches

1. First, we need to know how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

2. Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day. So, each day she will hike:
   \[
   125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. If she hikes 250 miles each day for 30 days, the total miles she will hike is:
   \[
   250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in total. So, the additional miles she needs to hike are:
   \[
   9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the additional miles by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

So, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles each day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.

So, the store will make $27 from the red balls.

Next, let's calculate the money from the blue balls. There are 11 blue balls, and each one costs $5. So, we multiply 11 by 5:
\[ 11 \times 5 = 55 \]
So, the store will make $55 from the blue balls.

Finally, let's figure out the money from the green balls. There are 25 green balls, and each one costs $3. So, we multiply 25 by 3:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]
So, the store will make $75 from the green balls.

Now, we add up all the money from the red, blue, and green balls:

Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, let's add up how much Pierre and Paul are taking:
\[
\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

So, Jacques will have the rest of the apples. We subtract the total taken by Pierre and Paul from the total amount of apples:
\[
\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}

   - So, each worker makes \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
   - Since there are 2 workers, they make \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys together.

2. **Next, let's find out how many toys the next two workers make:**
   - Each of these workers makes 4 toys every hour.
   - They also work for 10 hours.
   - So, each worker makes \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
   - Since there are 2 workers, they make \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys together.

1. Let's say Seth had \( S \) stickers at the beginning.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he got from Seth. So, he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The rest of the stickers Luis had, he gave to Kris. So, Kris got \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:

1. First, we need to know how far Alfie needs to fly. The question says that the circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that distance is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. Now, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we multiply 120 by 5:
   \[
   120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply 600 by 1.25:
   \[
   600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Liam is 16 years old now.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. The problem says that two years ago, Liamâ€™s age was twice Vinceâ€™s age. So, if Vince was \( V \) years old two years ago, then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. To find \( V \), we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.
6. To find Vinceâ€™s current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9
   \]

Therefore, Vince is 9 years old now.

1. **Total Eggs Painted:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs Painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

3. **Find Out How Many Eggs Sarah Painted:**
   - Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs.
   - Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \) eggs.
   - So, \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
   - Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2S = 18 \).
   - Divide by 2: \( S = 9 \).

4. **Eggs Painted by Camden:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let's say Arnold painted \( A \) eggs.
   - So, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted \( 2A \) eggs.

6. **Total Eggs Painted by All Four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
   - So, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).
   - Subtract 30 from both sides: \( 2A = 26 \).
   - Divide by 2: \( A = 13 \).

7. **How Many More Eggs Did Camden Paint Than Arnold?**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make:**
   - Nik has 200 crayons.
   - Each group has 8 crayons.
   - So, we divide 200 by 8: 
     \[
     200 \div 8 = 25
     \]
   - Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons.

2. **Determine how many boxes are needed:**
   - Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, Nik needs 25 boxes.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   - Nik has 200 crayons.
   - So, the total weight of the crayons is:
     \[
     200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   - Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   - Nik has 25 boxes.
   - So, the total weight of the boxes is:
     \[
     25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
     \]

5. **Find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   - Add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes:
     \[
     200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
     \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   - There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   - So, we divide 400 ounces by 16:
     \[
     400 \div 16 = 25
     \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to find out how much of the tree John can actually use. The tree is 80 feet tall, but he can only use 80% of it. So, we calculate 80% of 80 feet:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, John cuts the usable part of the tree into 4-foot logs. To find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet, we divide 64 by 4:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each 4-foot log, John cuts 5 planks. So, we need to find out how many planks he gets from 16 logs:
\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, John sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much money he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:
\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, John makes:
\[ 96 \]

3. Together, Valerie and her brother earn:
   \[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:
   \[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]
5. Now, let's add up all their earnings to find the total amount of money they have together:
   \[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Time on the Beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles in 40 minutes, which means she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes.

2. **Speed on the Sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks twice as fast on the sidewalk.
   - If she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach, she walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

3. **Time on the Sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Since her speed on the sidewalk is 1 mile in 10 minutes, she spends 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

4. **Total Time:**
   - Time on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes
   - Total time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

So, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Jane has been saving $4 every week for the past 8 weeks. So, we need to find out how much she has saved so far. We do this by multiplying the amount she saves each week by the number of weeks she has been saving:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Jane wants to save a total of $60. We need to find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the amount she saves each week:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Next, we have 2 different trees, and each of these trees has 4 blue birds. So, we can calculate the total number of blue birds in these 2 trees:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds. So, the number of blue birds in this tree is:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add up all the blue birds from each group of trees:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has right now. The problem says that if Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 24 marbles.

So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that right now, he has:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]
So, Bob has 36 marbles.

Now, the problem asks what happens if Bob loses 10 marbles. If Bob loses 10 marbles from the 36 he has, he will have:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other mug is at an unknown temperature. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is warm enough for him to drink, which means it's at least 40 degrees.

To find out the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we need to use a simple formula for mixing temperatures. The formula is:

\[ \text{Final Temperature} = \frac{(\text{Volume of Water 1} \times \text{Temperature of Water 1}) + (\text{Volume of Water 2} \times \text{Temperature of Water 2})}{\text{Total Volume of Water}} \]

Let's plug in the numbers we know:
- Volume of Water 1 (from the 33-degree mug) = 4 ounces
- Temperature of Water 1 = 33 degrees
- Volume of Water 2 (from the unknown temperature mug) = 1 ounce
- Temperature of Water 2 = \( T \) (we need to find this)
- Total Volume of Water = 4 + 1 = 5 ounces
- Final Temperature = 40 degrees (at least)

Now, let's set up the equation:

\[ 40 = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 40 = \frac{132 + T}{5} \]

To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:

\[ 40 \times 5 = 132 + T \]

\[ 200 = 132 + T \]

Now, solve for \( T \):

\[ T = 200 - 132 \]

\[ T = 68 \]

So, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:

\[ \boxed{68} \]"

2. **Animals Added Each Day:**
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

3. **Number of Days:**
   - Three weeks is 21 days.

4. **Total Cows Added:**
   - 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Total Chickens Added:**
   - 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

6. **Total Cows After Three Weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

7. **Total Chickens After Three Weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

8. **Total Number of Animals:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.

First, we need to find out how much 4 packs of bagels cost without any discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is buying 4 packs. So, we do:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]
So, 4 packs cost $40.00.

Next, we need to apply the 10% discount. To find 10% of $40.00, we do:
\[ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]
So, the discount is $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]
So, after the discount, the total cost is $36.00.

Each pack has 9 bagels, and Russell is buying 4 packs. So, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]
So, there are 36 bagels in total.

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's break that down:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a simple ratio:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:

\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times x \]
\[ 54 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

5 eggs/day Ã— 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs for 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs that is:
240 eggs Ã· 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 8 minutes long.

3. Now, we add the lengths of both songs to get the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much Linus sells each mobile device for. He buys each one for $20 and sells it for twice that amount. So, the selling price is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many devices he bought in total. He bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. So, the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying these devices. Each device costs $20, and he bought 6 devices, so:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to find out how much money he made from selling all the devices. Each device is sold for $40, and he sold 6 devices, so:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Linus made is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know that Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so we subtract 2 from 7:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
   So, Ned is 5 feet tall.
3. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so we add 1 to 5:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
   So, Carl is 6 feet tall.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, we divide Carl's height by 2:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Carl's cane is 3 feet long.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Hortex makes 4200 bottles of carrot juice every day.
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs.
   - We need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

2. **Calculate the Total Bottles Needed:**
   - If one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, then 5 bottles (100% / 20%) are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy needs.
   - For 2300 people, we need:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine the Additional Bottles Needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - To find out how many more bottles are needed:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

So, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

7300"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Total number of babies:**
   - Carla has 8 babies (octuplets).

2. **Babies dressed in purple:**
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the babies are dressed in purple.
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) babies are dressed in purple.

3. **Babies dressed in blue:**
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the babies are dressed in blue.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) babies are dressed in blue.

4. **Babies wearing bows:**
   - All 2 blue babies wear bows.
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 6 purple babies wear bows.
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple babies wear bows.

5. **Total number of babies wearing bows:**
   - 2 blue babies + 2 purple babies = 4 babies wearing bows.

6. **Probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple.
   - The probability is \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

7. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \).

So, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

The IRS got a total of 5168 tax reports last week. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports. We need to find out how many reports they got on Wednesday.

First, let's add the reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1907 (Monday and Tuesday) + 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 4043

Now, we subtract this total from the total number of reports they got last week:
5168 (total reports) - 4043 (reports from Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri) = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"Abraham had 80 square meters of land. First, he sold half of it, which is 40 square meters, for $50. So, he had 40 square meters left.

Then, he sold 1/4 of the original 80 square meters, which is 20 square meters, for $30. Now, he has 20 square meters left.

Finally, he sold the last 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he got 20 * $3 = $60 from this sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he made:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $60

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140

1. **Total Eggs Hidden:**
   - Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. 
   - 1 dozen is 12 eggs, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

2. **Eggs Found by Each Person:**
   - Lamar found 5 eggs.
   - Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
   - Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
   - Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

3. **Total Eggs Found:**
   - Add up all the eggs found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

4. **Eggs Still Hidden:**

"Okay, let's figure out how much money John makes in a week from collecting garbage.

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the third complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. To find 60% of 400:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]

So, the third complex has:
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's add up all the apartments John collects garbage from:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 3120 \text{ collections/week} \]

John gets paid $0.40 for each collection. So, his total earnings per week are:

"Okay, let's figure out how many fruits an avocado tree can produce over 10 years.

1. **5-year-old tree**: It produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: It produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: It produces 7 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: It produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: It doesn't produce any fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: It produces 20 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we would in a middle school math class.

First, let's say the length of the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters. 

The problem tells us that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. So, the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.

It also says that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. So, the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Now, let's simplify this equation:

\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( B \). First, subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long. 

Now, we need to find the length of the red rope, which is \( 4B \):

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa got \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
3. Both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount of money to their little sister. Let's call this amount \(x\).
4. After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. This means:
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
5. Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
   \]
6. So, we have:
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
7. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   15 - 12 = x \implies x = 3

"Okay, let's figure out the total area of Tom's house step by step.

1. **Bedrooms:**
   - Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet.
   - The area of one bedroom is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) square feet.
   - Tom has 4 bedrooms, so the total area for the bedrooms is \(4 \times 240 = 960\) square feet.

2. **Living Room:**
   - The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
   - The area of one bedroom is 240 square feet, so the area of the living room is \(5 \times 240 = 1200\) square feet.

3. **Rest of the House:**
   - The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

4. **Total Area:**

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she counts double the number from Monday, so:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

On Wednesday, she counts double the number from Tuesday, so:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

On Thursday, she counts double the number from Wednesday, so:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

On Friday, she counts double the number from Thursday, so:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Now, let's add up all the puffs of clouds she counted from Monday to Friday:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

First, add 3 and 6:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Next, add 9 and 12:
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Then, add 21 and 24:
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]

1. **Find out how many pods are in the special size box:**
   - A regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - So, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - There are 120 pods in the special size box.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - Each pod costs $0.10.
   - For $1, you can buy \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.**
   - To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20.
   \[
   1000 \div 20 = 50
   \]
   So, Thomas gets 50 $20 bills.

2. **He loses 10 of these $20 bills.**
   - If he loses 10 bills, we subtract 10 from 50.
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40
   \]
   So, he has 40 $20 bills left.

3. **He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.**
   - Half of 40 is 20.
   \[
   40 \div 2 = 20
   \]
   So, he uses 20 $20 bills to pay for the bill, and he has 20 $20 bills left.

4. **Thomas then triples his money.**
   - First, we find out how much money he has left in $20 bills.
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   - Then, we triple this amount.
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]
   So, he now has $1200.

5. **He converts all his money to $5 bills.**
   - To find out how many $5 bills he gets, we divide $1200 by $5.
   \[
   1200 \div 5 = 240

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)

   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Calculate how much chalk is used on Monday:**
   - The teacher uses 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - 45% of 5 inches is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - So, the teacher uses 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday.

3. **Find out how much chalk is left after Monday:**
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

4. **Determine how much chalk is used each day after Monday:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - This means 80% of the chalk is left each day.

5. **Calculate the remaining chalk for each day:**
   - **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
     - Remaining chalk: \( 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.

3. The dentist also caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, if he drills 4 teeth, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.
4. Now, we add the teeth drilled and the teeth capped to find the total number of teeth fixed: 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.
5. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiply by 100:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're working through a math problem in middle school.

We need to find out how old Colin is right now. We have two clues:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the first clue:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

This means Wendy's age is 5 times what Colin's age will be in 7 years.

From the second clue:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

This means in 25 years, Colin's age will be one-third of Wendy's current age.

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, we can expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To get rid of the fraction, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]

Now, distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we need to get all the \( C \) terms on one side. Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Then, subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Finally, divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that 100 books cost $500. So, we need to find out how much one book costs:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Now, we can find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000:
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books}
   \]

3. Since Bob is buying books for 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school gets:
   \[
   \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books}
   \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

1800"
"Okay, let's figure out how many apples Newton brought home step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree.
3. Throwing the apple into the tree made 5 more apples fall out.
4. Newton picked up these 5 apples, plus the one he had left on the ground, so he had 6 apples.
5. He put 5 of these apples in his pocket and threw the last one at the tree.
6. Throwing this apple made 6 more apples fall out.
7. Newton picked up all 6 of these apples and went home.

Now, let's count the apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first time he picked them up.
- 5 apples from the second time he picked them up.
- 6 apples from the third time he picked them up.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:
1 + 5 + 6 = 12

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags Ali ordered. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to find out how much these 17 bags cost. We do this by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Ali's order costs:
306"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many cheese pizza slices all of Kate's friends will eat together. Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza. So, we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole cheese pizzas that is. Each cheese pizza has 12 slices. So, we divide:

\[ 36 \text{ slices} \div 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, let's do the same for the pepperoni pizza. Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. So, we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. So, we divide:

\[ 24 \text{ slices} \div 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas together to find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, Kate needs to buy 6 pizzas.

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 days, so:
3 miles/day Ã— 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. That's 2 days, so:
5 miles/day Ã— 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the miles from all the days together:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **How many snowballs does Jay make in an hour?**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **How many snowballs melt in an hour?**
   - Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.
   - There are 4 sets of 15 minutes in one hour.
   - So, in one hour, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt.

3. **How many snowballs does Jay have left after one hour?**
   - Jay makes 20 snowballs but 8 melt.
   - So, the net number of snowballs he has after one hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\).

4. **How long will it take to have 60 snowballs?**
   - If Jay makes 12 snowballs per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes to make 60 snowballs.
   - We divide 60 by 12: \(60 \div 12 = 5\).

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **John's Current Age:**
   - John is 28 years old now.

2. **Time Frame:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.

3. **John's Age 20 Years Ago:**
   - If John is 28 now, 20 years ago he was \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) years old.

4. **Relationship Between John's and Jim's Ages 20 Years Ago:**
   - The problem says that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was half of that age.
   - So, Jim was \( 8 \div 2 = 4 \) years old 20 years ago.

5. **Jim's Current Age:**
   - If Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago, then now he is \( 4 + 20 = 24 \) years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate 3 slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 3 slices.

So, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.

They all ate 6 slices of the apple.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they gained 50 - 38 = 12 bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - They didn't order any more bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they lost 28 bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack of bandages, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
   - They ordered two bulk packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they gained 100 - 25 = 75 bandages.

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total change over the three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, to find out how many bandages they started with, we subtract the total change from the final number of bandages:
78 - 59 = 19

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

First, the color costs $40. That's easy to remember.

Next, we need to figure out the cost of the haircut. May's hair was 10 inches long and it was cut to 8 inches. So, the hair was cut by:
\[ 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. So, for 2 inches, the cost is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jason made in two weeks. We need to add up the money he got for each job he did.

1. For doing his laundry, he got $3.00. He did this once.
2. For cleaning his room, he got $1.50. He did this once.
3. For taking the trash out, he got $0.75 each time. He did this twice.
4. For emptying the dishwasher, he got $0.50 each time. He did this six times.

Now, let's add it all up:

- Laundry: $3.00
- Cleaning room: $1.50
- Trash: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- Dishes: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

2. She also bought twice as many packs of black pens as red pens. So, the number of packs of black pens is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs}
   \]
   Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens. So, the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John bought 10 bottles for $600, so we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he did scotch. So, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. To find the cost of one bottle of cognac, we add 50% of the cost of a bottle of scotch to the cost of a bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much John spends on all the bottles of cognac. We multiply the number of bottles of cognac by the cost per bottle:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find out how much John spends in total:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John spends a total of:

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more on the second day than he did on the first day. So, he planted \(40 + (40 \times \frac{1}{4}) = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Adding up all the trees, he planted \(30\) White Oak trees and \(40 + 50 = 90\) Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees he planted is \(30 + 90 = 120\).

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

The problem says: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacherâ€™s lounge is 40.""

First, let's break it down:
- ""Four times the number of coffee mugs"" means we multiply the number of coffee mugs by 4.
- ""Eight more than"" means we add 8 to that result.
- The total is 40.

So, if we let \( x \) be the number of coffee mugs, we can write the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
   \[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
   \[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacherâ€™s lounge is 8.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know there are 66 fish in the tank. One-third of these fish have red stripes. So, we need to find out how many fish that is:

\[ \text{Fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after we take out the ones with red stripes:

\[ \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we're told that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we need to find out how many fish that is:

\[ \text{Fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total:

\[ \text{Total fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \text{ shells} \]

So, Team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after Team Alphas have found theirs. We subtract the number of shells found by Team Alphas from the total number of shells:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \text{ shells} \]

Now, Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find out how many shells they found, we calculate 60% of 420:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells} \]

So, Team The Finders found 252 shells.

Now, we know how much the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Let's add those up:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

So, the first three dogs together walk 8 miles. To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles the first three dogs walk from the total miles all four dogs need to walk:

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the low setting is \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the medium setting is \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Next, we need to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses. We multiply the total amount for one dose by 8:
56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali teaches one class.
   - His class can hold 120 students.
   - So, the total number of students Ali's school can hold is 120.

2. **John's School:**
   - John has two classes.
   - Each of John's classes can hold 1/8 of the number of students in Ali's class.
   - First, we need to find out how many students each of John's classes can hold:
     \[
     \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students per class}
     \]
   - Since John has two classes, the total number of students his school can hold is:
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
     \]

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - To find the total number of students both schools can hold together, we add the capacities of both schools:
     \[
     120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
     \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

150"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Calculate the total amount Stephen owes, including the interest:**
   - Stephen borrowed $300.
   - He promised to pay an extra 2% interest.
   - To find 2% of $300, we do: 
     \[
     300 \times 0.02 = 6
     \]
   - So, the total amount he owes is:
     \[
     300 + 6 = 306
     \]

2. **Calculate how much Stephen pays over the first 11 months:**
   - Stephen pays $25 each month for 11 months.
   - To find the total amount paid in 11 months, we do:
     \[
     25 \times 11 = 275
     \]

3. **Calculate how much Stephen still owes after 11 months:**
   - The total amount he owes is $306.
   - He has already paid $275.
   - To find the remaining amount, we do:
     \[
     306 - 275 = 31
     \]

So, Stephen will pay \(\boxed{31}\) in the twelfth month."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Jordan has 2 kids who need diapers.
2. Each kid needs 5 diaper changes a day.
3. So, for 2 kids, that's 5 changes per kid times 2 kids, which equals 10 diaper changes a day.
4. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
5. Half of 10 is 5, so Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers.
6. That means Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a box shape, so we need to find the volume by multiplying the length, width, and height.
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for the jelly beans:**
   The jelly beans don't fill the jar completely; they only fill about 80% of the space.
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans:**
   Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches. To find out how many jelly beans fit in the effective volume, we divide the effective volume by the volume of one jelly bean.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim thinks that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, we need to find 30% of 2880.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Find out how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The actual number of red jelly beans is 900. To see how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his estimate from the actual number.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

So, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Starting Point:**
   - The bus starts with 20 people.

2. **First Stop:**
   - 40 more people get on the bus.
   - Total people on the bus now: \(20 + 40 = 60\).

3. **Second Stop:**
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on at the second stop: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \).
   - Total people on the bus now: \(60 + 30 = 90\).

4. **Third Stop:**
   - The number of people on the bus doubles.
   - Total people on the bus now: \(90 \times 2 = 180\).

5. **Bus Capacity:**
   - The bus can hold 200 people.
   - Number of empty seats left: \(200 - 180 = 20\).

"Okay, let's figure out how much Pauline spent on her visits to the museum.

First, we need to find out how much she spent before the price went up. She visits the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2. So, for one year, she spends:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$2/\text{visit} = \$6/\text{year} \]

She does this for 5 years, so the total cost for the first 5 years is:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times \$6/\text{year} = \$30 \]

Next, the price of a visit goes up by 150%. To find the new price, we need to calculate 150% of $2 and add it to the original price:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$2 = 1.5 \times \$2 = \$3 \]

So, the new price of one visit is:

\[ \$2 + \$3 = \$5 \]

Now, Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years at the new price. So, for one year, she spends:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$5/\text{visit} = \$15/\text{year} \]

For 3 years, the total cost is:

\[ 3 \text{ years} \times \$15/\text{year} = \$45 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 years and the next 3 years to get the total amount Pauline spent:

\[ \$30 + \$45 = \$75 \]

So, Pauline spent a total of:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many students are going to try the escape room. There are 10 students from each grade, and there are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th).

So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students we can make. We divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group gets 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, we need to find out how long it will take for all 5 groups to go through the escape room. We multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the wooden tables cost. John made 4 wooden tables, and each table costs $20. So, we multiply the number of tables by the cost of each table:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

Next, we need to find out how much the roof frames cost. John made 2 roof frames, and each frame costs $10. So, we multiply the number of frames by the cost of each frame:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the frames to get the total amount Ali has to pay:
$80 + $20 = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. We need to find out how long the longer piece is.

First, let's call the length of the shorter piece \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the longer piece will be \( 4x \) feet.

Now, the total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times this length:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

32"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will use to make 80 meatballs. We know that he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So, we can find out how many pounds he needs by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much of his secret seasoning he will use. Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

Next, Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply 175 inches by 2:

\[ 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

"To figure out how much a 36-minute call costs, we need to split it into two parts because the price changes after 16 minutes.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes:
- The price is $0.25 per minute.
- So, for 16 minutes, it's 16 times $0.25, which is $4.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the remaining 20 minutes:
- After 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.20 per minute.
- So, for 20 minutes, it's 20 times $0.20, which is $4.00.

Now, we add the costs of both parts together:
- $4.00 (first 16 minutes) + $4.00 (next 20 minutes) = $8.00.

So, a 36-minute call would cost $8.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to understand what the problem is telling us:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
2. There are 5 people in her class, and each person gets 2 treats.

Let's use some simple math to solve this.

### Step 1: Set up the equations
Let's say \( c \) is the number of cupcakes Carly makes. Then, the number of brownies she makes is \( 3c - 2 \).

### Step 2: Total number of treats
Since there are 5 people and each gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

### Step 3: Write the equation for the total treats
The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

### Step 4: Solve the equation
Combine like terms:
\[ c + 3c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the manicure and pedicure cost together before the discount. The manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. So, we add these together:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, the salon offers a 20% discount if you get both. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants nail art on each of her fingers. She has 10 fingers, and the nail art costs $3 per nail. So, we calculate the total cost for the nail art:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay:
\[ 90 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Susan has 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. So, for these 3 magazines:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. She also has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, for this magazine:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. So, for this magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[
36 + 6 + 24 = 66

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. The problem says Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to the number of paintings Samantha has, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has.
   \[
   27 + 12 = 39
   \]
   So, Shelley has 39 paintings.
3. The problem also says that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has, we can find out how many paintings Kim has.
   \[
   39 - 8 = 31

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy costs $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price goes up by 80%. To find out how much it goes up, we calculate 80% of $40:
   \[
   0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   So, the price in December is:
   \[
   40 + 32 = 72

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price then goes down by 50%. To find out how much it goes down, we calculate 50% of $72:
   \[
   0.50 \times 72 = 36

   So, the price in January is:
   \[
   72 - 36 = 36

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Charlie makes today.

First, we need to know how much he makes from the regular lessons:
- He charges $80 for each regular lesson.
- He has 4 regular lessons today.
- So, for the regular lessons, he makes \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars.

Next, we need to figure out how much he makes from the veteran lessons:
- He gives a 25% discount to veterans.
- So, the discount is \( 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \) dollars.
- The reduced rate for veterans is \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) dollars per lesson.
- He has 2 veteran lessons today.
- So, for the veteran lessons, he makes \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the money from both types of lessons:
- Total money made = Money from regular lessons + Money from veteran lessons
- Total money made = \( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars.

So, Charlie will make 440 dollars today.

Regina wrote 9 novels last year. This is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. We need to find out how many novels she wrote this year.

First, let's think about what 3 quarters means. If 9 novels are 3 quarters, then 1 quarter would be:

\[ \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

So, 1 quarter is 3 novels. Since there are 4 quarters in a whole, we can find the total number of novels by multiplying 3 (the number of novels in one quarter) by 4:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

1. **Find out how many hours Michael travels in 3 days:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, in 3 days, Michael travels for \(3 \times 24 = 72\) hours.

2. **Calculate the total distance Michael travels:**
   - Michael's speed is 50 km per hour.
   - So, in 72 hours, he travels \(50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 72 \, \text{hr} = 3600 \, \text{km}\).

3. **Find out what percentage of the total distance this is:**
   - The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.

   - Pasta costs $1.00 per box.
   - Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
   - Gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

2. Now, let's add up the total cost for one week:
   - Pasta: $1.00
   - Cheddar cheese: $3.00
   - Gruyere cheese: $6.00
   - Total for one week: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

3. Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Total Time to Clean All Classrooms:**
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom.
   - So, the total time to clean all classrooms is \( 80 \times 15 = 1200 \) minutes.

2. **Total Working Time in 5 Days:**
   - The custodian works 8 hours each day.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 hours is \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes per day.
   - Over 5 days, the total working time is \( 5 \times 480 = 2400 \) minutes.

3. **Average Time Spent Cleaning Per Day:**
   - The total time to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes.
   - The custodian has 5 days to do this.
   - So, the average time spent cleaning per day is \( 1200 \div 5 = 240 \) minutes.

4. **Percentage of the Day Spent Cleaning:**
   - The custodian works 480 minutes each day.
   - The average time spent cleaning per day is 240 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure out how many bookcases Elly needs for her 110 books.

First, let's see how many books each shelf can hold:
- The middle shelves: Each can hold 10 books, and there are 2 of them.
  So, \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books for the middle shelves.
- The bottom shelf: It can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
  So, \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books for the bottom shelf.
- The top shelf: It can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
  So, \(20 - 5 = 15\) books for the top shelf.

Now, let's add up all the books each bookcase can hold:
- Middle shelves: 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
- Total per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:
- Number of bookcases: \(110 \div 55 = 2\)

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen is 12 eggs, five dozens would be:
5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Next, she paid $2.40 for each dozen. So, the total cost for five dozens is:
5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Now, Rose is selling the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:
60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, her total earnings will be:
20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

To find her profit, we subtract the total cost from her total earnings:
$20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00.

"Okay, let's figure out how many white hats Skyler has.

1. First, we know that Skyler has 100 hats in total.
2. Half of the hats are red. So, the number of red hats is:
   \[
   \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]
3. Now, we need to find out how many hats are left after the red ones:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50
   \]
4. Out of these remaining 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]
5. Finally, the rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:
   \[
   50 - 30 = 20
   \]

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Archie pays for the bag of beef jerky when it's on sale. The regular price is $18.00, but it's $3.00 off. So, we subtract $3.00 from $18.00:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

So, Archie pays $15.00 for the bag.

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of jerky costs. There are 30 sticks in the bag, and the bag costs $15.00. We divide the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

This means each stick costs $0.50. But the question asks for the cost in cents. Since $0.50 is the same as 50 cents, the cost per stick is:

"To figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on her second test, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Questions:**
   - First test: 70 questions
   - Second test: 40 questions
   - Total questions: 70 + 40 = 110 questions

2. **Passing Requirement:**
   - Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions correct.
   - 70% of 110 questions = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions

3. **Questions Correct on the First Test:**
   - Audrey got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
   - 60% of 70 questions = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions

4. **Questions Needed Correct on the Second Test:**
   - Total questions needed correct: 77
   - Questions already correct: 42
   - Questions needed correct on the second test: 77 - 42 = 35

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit in them. She makes some strawberry cubes and some blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. She makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

Let's call the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. \( S + B = 116 \)

First, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's combine like terms:
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) using the first equation:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is:
\[ 96 \]"

Ara has been playing basketball for 4 years. Each year, she plays 40 games. So, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

In each game, Ara scores 21 points. To find the total number of points she has scored over the 4 years, we multiply the total number of games by the points per game:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **First, we need to know how many customers Jason needs to sell 15 cars.**
   - For every 2 customers, 1 car is sold.
   - So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) customers.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many phone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers.**
   - For every 25 phone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - So, to get 30 customers, Jason needs \( 30 \times 25 = 750 \) phone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Flashlights:**
   - Each person has a flashlight, and there are 4 people.
   - Each room has 2 flashlights, and there are 8 rooms.
   - So, the total number of flashlights is:
     - Flashlights for people: 4
     - Flashlights for rooms: 2 * 8 = 16
     - Total flashlights: 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the 8 rooms have 5 medium candles each.
   - So, the total number of candles is:
     - Small candles: 4 * 4 = 16
     - Medium candles: 5 * 4 = 20
     - Total candles: 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36 = 56

So, the total number of candles and flashlights that Brianna's family is using is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Mitchell has two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. So, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. We do this by multiplying the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag:

\[ 2 \times 55 = 110 \]

So, Mitchell has 110 chips in total.

Next, we need to divide these chips equally among the five family members. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ 110 \div 5 = 22 \]

So, each person gets 22 chips.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. John takes 5 minutes to solve the first side of the Rubik's cube.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. Once John solves the fifth side, the sixth side is automatically solved, so it doesn't add any extra time.

Now, let's add up all the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, it takes John 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

Then, it says there are twice as many footballs as helmets. So, if there are 20 helmets, then there are:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ footballs} \]

Now, we add up all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ robots} + 20 \text{ helmets} + 40 \text{ footballs} = 70 \text{ items} \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many hours Tim works in a week. He works 6 hours each day for 5 days.
   \[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

2. Next, we need to convert those hours into minutes because each call takes 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   \[ 30 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute calls he can handle in 1800 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how long it takes for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.
   - The old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting.
   - So, for 6 paintings: \( 7 \text{ minutes} \times 6 = 42 \text{ minutes} \).

2. Next, we need to find out how long it takes for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.
   - The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting.
   - So, for 6 paintings: \( 12 \text{ minutes} \times 6 = 72 \text{ minutes} \).

3. Now, we need to find out how much longer the new varnish takes compared to the old varnish.
   - The difference in time is: \( 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"Okay, let's figure out how much water Crista needs for her plants every day.

First, we need to break it down:

- Crista has 4 plants that need half a cup of water each. So, for these plants:
  \[
  4 \text{ plants} \times 0.5 \text{ cups/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
  \]

- She has 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each. So, for these plants:
  \[
  8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups}
  \]

- The rest of her plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. First, we need to find out how many plants are left:
  \[
  20 \text{ total plants} - 4 \text{ plants} - 8 \text{ plants} = 8 \text{ plants}
  \]
  So, for these plants:
  \[
  8 \text{ plants} \times 0.25 \text{ cups/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
  \]

Now, we add up all the water needed:
\[
2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}
\]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Phineas Frog needs to travel 200 yards to get back home. Half of this distance is on land, and the other half is in water.

1. **Distance on Land**: 
   - Half of 200 yards is 100 yards.
   - Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute.
   - Time to travel 100 yards on land: 
     \[
     \text{Time on Land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Distance in Water**:
   - The other half of 200 yards is also 100 yards.
   - Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute.
   - Time to travel 100 yards in water:
     \[
     \text{Time in Water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time**:
   - To find the total time, we add the time on land and the time in water:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's figure out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

First, we need to find out how much she spends each week. She drops off:
- 5 blouses at $5.00 each
- 2 pants at $8.00 each
- 1 skirt at $6.00 each

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type of clothing:
- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pants * $8.00 = $16.00
- Skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00

Next, we add these costs together to get the total for one week:
- Total for one week: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Now, we need to find out how much she spends in 5 weeks. We multiply the weekly cost by 5:

1. **John's original speaking speed**: John normally speaks at 150 words per minute (WPM).

2. **John's new speaking speed**: After training, he can speak 2.5 times faster. So, we multiply his original speed by 2.5:
   \[
   150 \text{ WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM}
   \]

3. **Total number of words in 10 pages**: Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages. So, we multiply the number of words per page by the number of pages:
   \[
   450 \text{ words/page} \times 10 \text{ pages} = 4500 \text{ words}
   \]

4. **Time to speak 4500 words**: Now, we need to find out how long it takes John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We divide the total number of words by his new speaking speed:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times as many kernels pop as in the first 30 seconds. So, \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times as many kernels pop as in the first 30 seconds. So, \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half as many kernels pop as in the previous 30 seconds. So, \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:

1. **Lemons for the Pool Party:**
   - Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice for 1 gallon of lemonade.
   - He wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - So, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).
   - Since 6 lemons make 1 cup of lemon juice, he will need \(4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

2. **Lemons for Allen's Extra Gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon will need 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - So, he will need \(2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}\).

3. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen's extra gallon: 12 lemons

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much food the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of food a day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- So, 5 kilograms times 3 German Shepherds equals 15 kilograms of food a day for the German Shepherds.

Next, we need to find out how much food the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of food a day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, 3 kilograms times 2 Bulldogs equals 6 kilograms of food a day for the Bulldogs.

Now, we add the daily food for both types of dogs to get the total daily food consumption:
- 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms of food a day for all the dogs.

Finally, we need to find out how much food they need for a whole week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, 21 kilograms a day times 7 days equals 147 kilograms of food for the week.

So, the kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

Next, we need to find out how many legs all the 4-legged animals have together. Since each 4-legged animal has 4 legs, and there are 15 of them:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First Part of the Journey:**
   - Elvis drives west for 5 hours.
   - He drives at 18 miles per hour.
   - To find out how far he goes, we use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - So, the distance he travels west is:
     \[
     18 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Second Part of the Journey:**
   - Elvis turns around and drives east for 8 hours.
   - He still drives at 18 miles per hour.
   - Using the same formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - So, the distance he travels east is:
     \[
     18 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Net Distance from Home:**
   - Elvis first went 90 miles west.
   - Then he went 144 miles east.
   - To find out how far he is from home, we subtract the distance he went west from the distance he went east:
     \[
     144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles}

"Okay, let's figure out how much the boat is worth after three years of depreciation.

1. **First Year:**
   - The boat starts at $9000.
   - It loses 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $9000 is \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \).
   - So, after the first year, the boat is worth \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $6300.
   - It loses another 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $6300 is \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \).
   - So, after the second year, the boat is worth \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $4410.
   - It loses 20% of its value.
   - 20% of $4410 is \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \).
   - So, after the third year, the boat is worth \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \).

The boat is worth $3528 after three years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 54 red candies.
2. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies. So, we do:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108

   That means there are 108 orange candies.
3. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies. So, we do:

   That means there are 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up all the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
54 + 108 + 27 = 189

"Okay, let's figure out how much Helen spent on her trip to Germany.

First, we need to find out how much she paid for the hotel. She stayed for 3 nights, and each night cost $80. So, we multiply the number of nights by the cost per night:
\[ 3 \text{ nights} \times \$80 \text{ per night} = \$240 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she paid for the bus rides. She took the bus 7 times, and each bus ride cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. First, we calculate 10% of $80:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.10 \times \$80 = \$8 \]
So, each bus ride costs $8. Now, we multiply the number of bus rides by the cost per ride:
\[ 7 \text{ rides} \times \$8 \text{ per ride} = \$56 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, Helen paid a total of $296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the tickets cost. The parents each need an adult ticket, and each adult ticket costs $12. So, for two adult tickets:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Next, the child needs a child ticket, which costs $8. So, for one child ticket:
\[ 8 \]

Now, they also buy 2 popcorns, and each popcorn costs $3. So, for two popcorns:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

To find the total cost, we add up all these amounts:
\[ 24 + 8 + 6 = 38 \]

So, the family pays a total of $38.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find the total weight of everything in the car. The car itself weighs 1200 pounds.
2. The luggage in the car weighs 250 pounds.
3. John has two young children, and each child weighs 75 pounds. So, the total weight of the children is 75 pounds + 75 pounds = 150 pounds.

Now, let's add all these weights together:
- Car: 1200 pounds
- Luggage: 250 pounds
- Children: 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much force John needs to push the car. The problem says that the force needed is 1% of the total weight.

To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01 (which is the same as 1%):
Force = 1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push with a force of 16 pounds.

Mia is 40 years old, and she is 16 years younger than Emma. So, to find Emma's age, we add 16 to Mia's age:

40 + 16 = 56

So, Emma is 56 years old.

Now, to find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and then divide by 2:

40 + 56 = 96

96 Ã· 2 = 48

So, the average of their ages is 48.

48"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up all the seashells that Tom, Nancy, and Benny found:
- Tom found 214 seashells.
- Nancy found 432 seashells.
- Benny found 86 seashells.

So, we add these together:
214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells in total.

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total:
- They found 67 cracked seashells.

So, we subtract the cracked seashells from the total:
732 - 67 = 665 good seashells.

Therefore, the number of good seashells they found together is 665.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much feed one pig eats in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, and they eat twice a day. So, one pig eats:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. Now, Dexter has five pigs. So, the total amount of feed all the pigs eat in one day is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. Next, we need to find out how much feed the pigs eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the amount of feed the pigs ate from the total amount of feed:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, after a week, Dexter has 20 pounds of feed left.

"Okay, let's figure out how much John needs to spend on hot dogs for his birthday party.

1. First, we need to find out how many hot dogs John needs in total. He invited 20 people, and each person will eat 2 hot dogs.
   - So, 20 people * 2 hot dogs/person = 40 hot dogs.

2. John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, we need to find out how many more hot dogs he needs to buy.
   - 40 hot dogs needed - 4 hot dogs he already has = 36 hot dogs.

3. Hot dogs come in packs of 6, and each pack costs $2. We need to figure out how many packs John needs to buy.
   - 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs.

4. Now, we need to find out how much 6 packs of hot dogs will cost.
   - 6 packs * $2 per pack = $12.

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

- She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each. So, the money from cupcakes is:
  \[
  20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40
  \]

- She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each. So, the money from cookies is:
  \[
  40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40
  \]

Now, let's add the money from cupcakes and cookies to find the total money she makes:
\[
\$40 + \$40 = \$80
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Frances spends on the trays.

- She buys 5 trays at $4 each. So, the cost of the trays is:
  \[
  5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20
  \]

Finally, we subtract the cost of the trays from the total money she makes to find out how much money she has left:

So, Frances has \(\boxed{60}\) dollars left."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First Street:**
   - The ice cream truck starts with 5 children following it.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - So, 5 children + 5 more children = 10 children.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children.
   - So, 10 children + (10 children Ã— 2) = 10 children + 20 children = 30 children.

4. **Children Leaving:**
   - The original 5 children give up and leave.
   - So, 30 children - 5 children = 25 children.

So, the final number of children following the truck is:

- On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
- On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
- On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

First, we need to add up all the meals she gave out over the weekend:
64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Now, we subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals she started with:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

   - So, the total age of the sisters is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) years.

2. One of the brothers is 12 years old.
   - The problem says that this brother is half the age of the older brother.
   - So, the older brother must be \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.

3. Now, we add the ages of the brothers:
   - The total age of the brothers is \(12 + 24 = 36\) years.

4. Finally, we add the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers:
   - The total age of all the siblings is \(48 + 36 = 84\) years.

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84.

"Okay, let's figure out how much time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks.

First, let's look at the meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
- So, she meditates for \(15 + 15 = 30\) minutes each day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so she meditates for \(30 \times 7 = 210\) minutes each week.
- In 4 weeks, she meditates for \(210 \times 4 = 840\) minutes.

Next, let's look at the yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- So, she practices yoga for \(60 \times 5 = 300\) minutes each week.
- In 4 weeks, she practices yoga for \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga:

"To figure out how big the quilt is, we need to add up the sizes of all the t-shirts Octavia is using. 

First, let's look at the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts.
- So, the total area from the small t-shirts is 3 square feet/t-shirt * 11 t-shirts = 33 square feet.

Next, the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia is using 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, the total area from the medium t-shirts is 4 square feet/t-shirt * 8 t-shirts = 32 square feet.

Finally, the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia is using 6 large t-shirts.
- So, the total area from the large t-shirts is 6 square feet/t-shirt * 6 t-shirts = 36 square feet.

Now, we add up all the areas:
- Total area = 33 square feet (from small t-shirts) + 32 square feet (from medium t-shirts) + 36 square feet (from large t-shirts) = 101 square feet.

So, the quilt is 101 square feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many seeds are in a small sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower like this:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seeds are in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we do:
\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, we add these 18 seeds to the 36 seeds in the small sunflower to get the total number of seeds in the large sunflower:
\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:
\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

   - So, Anne's height is \( 36 \times 2 = 72 \) inches.

2. **Find Jackie's current height:**
   - Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne.
   - So, Jackie's current height is \( 72 - 2 = 70 \) inches.

3. **Find Jackie's height before the summer:**
   - Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - So, Jackie's height before the summer was \( 70 - 3 = 67 \) inches.

Therefore, Jackie's height before the summer was 67 inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many chocolate bars the company makes in one day. The company makes 5000 bars each day.
2. Next, we need to find out how many days are in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 14 days.
3. Now, we can calculate how many chocolate bars the company makes in two weeks. We multiply the number of bars made in one day by the number of days in two weeks:
   \[
   5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars}
   \]
4. The company sells each bar for $2. To find out how much money they make, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar:
   \[
   70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jake spends at the store.

First, let's look at the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and there's a deal where you get one at 50% off. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price: $8.
- For the second T-shirt, Jake gets 50% off, so he pays half of $8, which is $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's look at the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. 

- To find the discount, we calculate 40% of $40:
\[ 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]
- So, the discount is $16, and Jake pays the remaining amount:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ 36 \]"

   - Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * 8 = $12
   - Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * 10 = $20

   Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

2. **Cost to make 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

3. **Revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Tim sells each jar for $50, so for 10 jars = 10 * $50 = $500

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Justin has in his jar. We need to add up the value of all the different types of coins.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Justin has 32 quarters.
   - So, 32 quarters Ã— 25 cents = 800 cents.
   - 800 cents is the same as 8 dollars.

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Justin has 95 dimes.
   - So, 95 dimes Ã— 10 cents = 950 cents.
   - 950 cents is the same as 9.50 dollars.

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Justin has 120 nickels.
   - So, 120 nickels Ã— 5 cents = 600 cents.
   - 600 cents is the same as 6 dollars.

   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **Randy eats 3 cookies for an early snack, one of each type:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

3. **Randy eats 2 more oatmeal cookies for lunch:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

4. **Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:**

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell half of them for $5 each and the other half for $7 each.

First, we need to find out how many toy soldiers are in each half:
- Half of 12 is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \).

So, he will sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

Next, we calculate how much he will earn from each half:
- For the 6 toy soldiers sold at $5 each:
  \[
  6 \times 5 = 30
  \]
- For the 6 toy soldiers sold at $7 each:
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many holes the dog dug while Nate was on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate was gone for 14 days. So, we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Now, when Nate gets back, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes each night. So, each day, the net number of holes filled is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Norman High School has 4000 students on average. Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. 

First, we need to find out how many students Butler High School has. We do this by multiplying 4000 by 3/4:

\[ 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School has 3000 students on average.

Next, we need to find out how many more students Norman High School has compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School:

\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School.

The Adams family has made a total of 7995 cookies. Out of these, they have 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. We need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies they have made.

First, let's add up the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 (rainbow) + 3075 (oatmeal) = 5670 cookies

Now, we subtract this total from the overall number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
7995 (total) - 5670 (rainbow and oatmeal) = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

But Igor made some mistakes:
- He only got half as many test tubes as asked, so he got \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- He got two more Petri dishes than asked, so he got \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- He got the right number of beakers, which is 7, but he lost some on the way.

We know that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. Let's set up an equation to find out how many beakers he lost.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. So, the number of beakers he actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can write the equation for the total number of items:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 29 from 31:
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg needs 2 screws.
3. So, for one table, you need \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. James is putting together 4 tables, so he needs \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).
5. James has 40 screws in total.

Now, let's find out how many screws he will have left over:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, James will have 8 screws left over.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much each girl raised:

- Alexandra raised $430.
- Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra. So, Kim raised \(430 + 320 = 750\) dollars.
- Sarah raised $300.
- Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah. So, Maryam raised \(300 + 400 = 700\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money they raised:

\[
430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180
\]

So, the total amount of money they all raised is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Aaron and Vanessa's Distances:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Aaron's Time:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.

3. **Aaron's Speed:**
   - To find Aaron's speed, we divide the distance he ran by the time it took.
   - Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Vanessa's Speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - So, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

5. **Vanessa's Time:**
   - To find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we multiply the distance by her speed.
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much line the caretaker needs for the dock. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply:

\[ 3 \text{ feet of line} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to see how much line the caretaker already has. He has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much money one reservation makes. Each reservation orders:
- 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- 1 bottle of wine that costs $5.

So, one reservation makes:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money the restaurant makes in one night. The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total money made in a week is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the restaurant makes:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Find the total cost of the watermelons:**
   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the profit:**
   - The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   - To find 25% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.25.
   - \( 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \)
   - So, the profit is $20.

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - The total selling price is the total cost plus the profit.
   - \( 80 + 20 = 100 \)
   - So, the total selling price is $100.

4. **Find the selling price per watermelon:**
   - To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.
   - \( 100 \div 50 = 2 \)
   - So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Dora's Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - So, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **James's Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - So, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **John's Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is 18 years old now.
   - So, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Youngest Son's Age:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is 37 years old now.
   - So, the youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years:**
   - The youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

So, in 3 years, John's youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Ana's Peeling Time:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour, there are 60 minutes.
   - So, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

2. **Jane's Peeling Time:**
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour, there are 60 minutes.
   - So, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Difference in Oranges Peeled:**
   - To find out how many more oranges Ana peels than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels.
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the radiator costs $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find out how much he saves, we calculate 80% of $400:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, he saves $320. Now, we subtract that from the original price to find out how much he pays for the radiator:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, the mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, we calculate the total cost for the mechanic:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have a total of 70 legs. We need to find out how many of these animals are chickens.

1. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.

2. **Write the equations based on the information:**
   - The total number of animals: \( c + k = 20 \)
   - The total number of legs: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

3. **Simplify the second equation:**
   - Divide the second equation by 2 to make it easier: \( c + 2k = 35 \)

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - We have:
     \[
     c + k = 20
     \]
     \[
     c + 2k = 35
     \]
   - Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):
     \[
     (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
     \]
     \[
     k = 15
     \]

5. **Find the number of chickens:**
   - Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
     \[
     c + 15 = 20
     \]
     \[
     c = 5
     \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
