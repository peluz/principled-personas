"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for her breakfast and baking, and then calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.

1. **Total eggs laid per day**: 16 eggs.
2. **Eggs used for breakfast**: 3 eggs.
3. **Eggs used for baking**: 4 eggs.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs used:
\[ 3 \text{ (breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (baking)} = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we find the number of eggs remaining for sale:
\[ 16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (used eggs)} = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Each egg is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs is:
\[ 9 \text{ (remaining eggs)} \times 2 \text{ (price per egg)} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of bolts required for a robe, considering both the blue and white fibers.

"To determine the profit Josh made, we need to follow a series of arithmetic steps, focusing on the percentage increase and the total costs involved.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Repair costs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after the repairs:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - 150% of the original value ($80,000) is calculated as:
     \[
     1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is:
     \[
     80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
     \[
     200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
     \]

Thus, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does in each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of sessions he has each week.

The calculation is as follows:
- Number of sprints per session: 3
- Distance per sprint: 60 meters
- Number of sessions per week: 3

Total distance per week = (Number of sprints per session) × (Distance per sprint) × (Number of sessions per week)
Total distance per week = 3 × 60 × 3 = 540 meters

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
  \[
  20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is:
  \[
  15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
  \]

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal:
  \[
  60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
  \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.
- The cost for one pair is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

Kylar is buying 16 glasses, which is equivalent to 8 pairs:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]

"Given the problem, we start by defining the number of sheep in each city based on the information provided:

- Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep in Seattle.
- Let \( C \) represent the number of sheep in Charleston.
- Let \( T \) represent the number of sheep in Toulouse.

From the problem, we know:
1. Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the initial partial download, the Windows restart, and the full re-download. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is:
     \[
     0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB}
     \]
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Add the time for the Windows restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the full 200 GB file again:**
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 200 GB is:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Sum the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 80 GB + Time for Windows restart + Time to download 200 GB
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes
   - Total time = 160 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the segments of John's journey and calculate the distances for each segment.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next 0.5 hours, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   - Total distance back home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance traveled back home = 135 miles.
   - Final distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay, then sum these amounts.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings Calculation:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we can set up an algebraic equation to represent the net profit over time.

Let \( n \) be the number of years.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue from Lemons**: \( 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \) dollars
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3
4. **Net Annual Profit**: \( 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \) dollars

The total profit after \( n \) years can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = 7.5n - 90 \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the total profit is non-negative:
\[ 7.5n - 90 \geq 0 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 7.5n \geq 90 \]
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the relationship between distance, time, and speed.

Given:
- Total distance \( D = 12 \) miles
- Desired average speed \( v_{\text{avg}} = 4 \) miles per hour

The formula for average speed is:
\[ v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{D}{T} \]
where \( T \) is the total time taken to complete the distance.

Rearranging to solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{D}{v_{\text{avg}}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken:
- 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles
- 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles

So, the total time already spent is:
\[ T_{\text{spent}} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

The remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ T_{\text{remaining}} = T - T_{\text{spent}} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ D_{\text{remaining}} = D - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed \( v_{\text{remaining}} \) she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ v_{\text{remaining}} = \frac{D_{\text{remaining}}}{T_{\text{remaining}}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

   - Since 1 liter is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is:
     \[
     10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Determine the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture:**
   - The total volume of the mixture is:
     \[
     9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
     \[
     6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

"To determine the original price of the book before the discount, we can use the relationship between the discounted price and the original price. Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price.

Let \( P \) represent the original price of the book. The equation based on the given information is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Performing the division:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Thus, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to analyze the given information:

- Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
- His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip.

First, we calculate the position of the second stop:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (45 miles):
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We are given that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the other pair is twice that amount, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and their total age.

Let \( D \) represent Darrell's age and \( A \) represent Allen's age. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We are also given that the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, solve for \( A \) by multiplying both sides by 11:
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Now, divide both sides by 18:
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[ \boxed{109} \]"
"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the mean of the guesses provided by Gunter's friends. Let's break down the steps:

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can break down the problem into a series of arithmetic steps:

1. **Daily Care Time per Dog**: Each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day.
2. **Total Daily Care Time for All Dogs**: Since John has 10 dogs, the total daily care time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]
3. **Weekly Care Time**: There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Thus, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"To solve the problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information and solve for the unknowns.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Given the problem, we can set up the relationships using algebraic expressions. Let \( R \) represent the number of jewels Raymond has, \( A \) represent the number of jewels Aaron has, and \( S \) represent the number of jewels Siobhan has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Raymond has 40 jewels: \( R = 40 \).
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels: \( A = \frac{R}{2} + 5 \).
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron: \( S = A - 2 \).

First, we substitute \( R = 40 \) into the equation for \( A \):
\[
A = \frac{40}{2} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we substitute \( A = 25 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[
S = 25 - 2 = 23

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each 20-minute interval and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

First, we calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

Next, we add this 25% increase to the points scored in the first 20 minutes to find the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both intervals to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can break down the problem into a few simple arithmetic steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of yogurts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per yogurt:**
   - The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - The cost per yogurt is:
     \[
     \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**
   - The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
     \[
     60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, then divide the distance by the time.

1. **Total Distance:**
   John runs 60 miles a week.

2. **Total Time:**
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.
   - Therefore, the total time he spends running each week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Average Speed:**
   The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distances Dana can cover while running and walking, given the time spent on each activity and her speeds.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the dragon's flame reach:**
   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.

3. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips can be consumed given the daily calorie target and the calories already consumed.

First, let's break down the information provided:
- Each serving of chips contains 250 calories.
- A 300g bag of chips has 5 servings.
- The daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
\[ \text{Total calories} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Determine the remaining calories you can consume without exceeding the daily target.
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of grams of chips that correspond to 200 calories. We know that the 300g bag contains 1250 calories, so we can find the number of grams per calorie:
\[ \text{Grams per calorie} = \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Step 4: Determine the number of grams of chips that can be consumed for 200 calories.
\[ \text{Grams of chips} = 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To solve the problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

1. Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

2. Add 140 to both sides to isolate \( x \):

"Given the problem, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the total amount spent on ties. Let's denote the number of blue ties as \( b \) and the number of red ties as \( r \).

1. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
   \[
   r = 2b
   \]

2. The cost of each blue tie is $40, and John spent $200 on blue ties:
   \[
   40b = 200
   \]

3. Solving for \( b \):
   \[
   b = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

4. Using the relationship \( r = 2b \):
   \[
   r = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

5. The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie:
   \[
   \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

6. The total amount spent on red ties:
   \[
   \text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

7. The total amount spent on all ties:
   \[

"To determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back, we need to use the relationship between distance, rate, and time, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels during his initial trip:
- Tom's ship travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour.
- He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
- Therefore, the distance traveled is:
  \[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back:
- Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.
- The distance to travel back is the same, 30 miles.
- Therefore, the time to travel back is:
  \[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

"To determine the average square footage of a level in a 4-leveled sandcastle where each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16, we can use the properties of geometric sequences.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

This forms a geometric sequence where the first term \( a_4 = 16 \) and the common ratio \( r = 2 \) (since each level is half the size of the one below it, we move up the sequence by multiplying by 2).

The terms of the sequence are:
- 4th level: \( a_4 = 16 \)
- 3rd level: \( a_3 = 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
- 2nd level: \( a_2 = 32 \times 2 = 64 \)
- 1st level: \( a_1 = 64 \times 2 = 128 \)

The total square footage of all levels is:
\[ S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{S}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is:

"Given the problem, we can use algebraic relationships to solve it step by step.

1. Let \( S \) represent the amount of laundry Sarah does.
2. Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does.
3. Let \( R \) represent the amount of laundry Raymond does.

From the problem, we know:
- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry: \( S = 400 \)
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David: \( S = 4D \)
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah: \( R = \frac{1}{2}S \)

First, we solve for \( D \) using the equation \( S = 4D \):
\[ 400 = 4D \]
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} \]
\[ D = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( R \) using the equation \( R = \frac{1}{2}S \):
\[ R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 \]
\[ R = 200 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = R - D \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 100 \]

   - Each child dinosaur consumes half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10 \, \text{lbs}}{2} = 5 \, \text{lbs} \).
   - There are 5 child dinosaurs.
   - Total potato salad for children = \( 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \).

3. **Calculate the total potato salad needed:**
   - Total potato salad = Total for adults + Total for children
   - Total potato salad = \( 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \).

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve the problem, we can use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the number of pets each person has.

Let \( C \) represent the number of pets Cindy has. According to the problem, Cindy has 4 pets:
\[ C = 4 \]

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, the number of pets Marcia has, \( M \), can be expressed as:
\[ M = C + 2 \]
Substituting the value of \( C \):
\[ M = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, the number of pets Jan has, \( J \), can be expressed as:
\[ J = 3M \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ J = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

To find the total number of pets the three have, we sum the number of pets each person has:
\[ \text{Total pets} = C + M + J \]
Substituting the values of \( C \), \( M \), and \( J \):
\[ \text{Total pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J \) represent Jackson's age.
2. Let \( A \) represent Amy's age.
3. Let \( C \) represent Corey's age.
4. Let \( M \) represent James's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
- James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
- James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

First, we can use the information about James and Corey to find Corey's age:
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, we can use Amy's age to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time and then calculate his improved time after a 10% speed increase.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - A 10% improvement in speed means Gerald can now run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - Gerald's improved time is \( 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \) seconds.

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships given in the problem and then solve for the unknowns.

Let:
- \( d \) represent the number of dogs.
- \( c \) represent the number of cats.
- \( r \) represent the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of dogs \( d \) is 60.
2. The number of cats \( c \) is twice the number of dogs, so \( c = 2d \).
3. The number of rabbits \( r \) is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so \( r = d + c - 12 \).

First, substitute the value of \( d \) into the equation for \( c \):
\[
c = 2d = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, substitute the values of \( d \) and \( c \) into the equation for \( r \):
\[
r = d + c - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, which is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = d + c + r = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce, given that the volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked and each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes.

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes:**
   - The final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces.
   - Since the volume is halved when cooked, the initial volume of tomatoes must be:
     \[
     32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cans used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - The number of cans used is:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of cans to the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - The total number of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Driving Through**:
   - Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
   - 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
3. **Cars Taking an Exit**: 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

The total number of cars initially is 30, so the equation is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read each day over the next 4 days, we first calculate the total number of pages he needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Adding these together gives:
\[ 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining number of pages is:
\[ 39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages} \]

He has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

"To solve this problem, we can use proportional reasoning to determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Given:
- The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
- The city is 42 miles across.

We need to find the total time \( T \) it takes for the fog bank to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion based on the given rate:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{T \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we solve for \( T \) by cross-multiplying:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times T \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ miles} \times 10 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 3T = 420 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to isolate \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{420}{3} \]
\[ T = 140 \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of a single box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

Given:
- Outer dimensions of each box: 5 inches (length) × 6 inches (width) × 4 inches (height)
- Wall thickness: 1 inch

The inner dimensions are calculated by subtracting twice the wall thickness from each outer dimension:
- Inner length: \( 5 - 2 \times 1 = 3 \) inches
- Inner width: \( 6 - 2 \times 1 = 4 \) inches
- Inner height: \( 4 - 2 \times 1 = 2 \) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = \text{Inner length} \times \text{Inner width} \times \text{Inner height} \]
\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since there are three boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times \text{Inner volume of one box} \]
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 \, \text{cubic inches} = 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

The total inner volume of all three boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can break down the total TV watching time over the week and isolate Wednesday's viewing.

First, let's calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these times together:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours per episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes} \]

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. According to the problem, Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies this year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, and he ended up with 110 cookies. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

After dropping 5 cookies, he had:
\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \( \boxed{50} \)."

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she initially purchased and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later, given the initial conditions and the percentage increases.

1. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.30L
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   40000 = 1.30L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = 30769.23
   \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary of $40,000. The new salary is:
   \[
   40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000
   \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Lylah's salary also increased by 40% from her initial salary of $30,769.23. The new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 + 12307.69 = 43076.92
   \]

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92
   \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic expressions to represent the costs and then calculate the total amount Dillon will spend.

Let's denote:
- The cost of one pepper as \( p \).
- The cost of one watermelon as \( w \).
- The cost of one orange as \( o \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each pepper costs $15, so \( p = 15 \).
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so \( w = 3p \).
3. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so \( o = w - 5 \).

First, we calculate the cost of a watermelon:
\[
w = 3p = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of an orange:
\[
o = w - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of item Dillon buys:
- Dillon buys 4 watermelons:
\[
\text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4w = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]
- Dillon buys 20 peppers:
\[
\text{Total cost for peppers} = 20p = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
\]
- Dillon buys 10 oranges:
\[
\text{Total cost for oranges} = 10o = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total amount Dillon will spend:
\[
\text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[

"To determine how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

- Steve's time: 
\[ \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

- Tim's time: 
\[ \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting.

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"To determine the total earnings from the bike inflation service, we calculate the cost based on the number of tires inflated and the price per tire.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. 

- For the bicycles: 5 bicycles × 2 tires per bicycle = 10 tires
- For the tricycles: 3 tricycles × 3 tires per tricycle = 9 tires
- For the unicycle: 1 unicycle × 1 tire per unicycle = 1 tire

Total number of tires inflated:
10 tires (bicycles) + 9 tires (tricycles) + 1 tire (unicycle) = 20 tires

Total cost:
20 tires × 25 cents per tire = 500 cents

Converting cents to dollars:
500 cents ÷ 100 = 5 dollars

"To solve this problem, we first determine the total number of cookies Carl has purchased. Given that he buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find the change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:

\$4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to determine the initial number of fries in the pack. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Final number of fries left:**
   - After all the events, 5 fries are left.

2. **Ants carried off one fry:**
   - Before the ants took one fry, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.

3. **Raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:**
   - Let \( y \) be the number of fries before the raccoon took any.
   - The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}y \) fries, leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y \) fries.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 6 \times 3 = 18
     \]

4. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:**
   - Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + (3 \times 3) = 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.

5. **Seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:**
   - The seagull ate 7 fries (half of 14).
   - Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.

6. **Dave ate 14 fries:**
   - Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

Thus, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( 48 \).

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per day is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours for these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per day is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours for these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
- Total hours per week = \(9\) hours (MWF) + \(8\) hours (TTh) = \(17\) hours.

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
- Total hours in one semester = \(17\) hours/week \(\times 16\) weeks = \(272\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To determine the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert the lengths of each type of baked good to feet and then sum them up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - The total length of all the baked goods is the sum of the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes.
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of increase per period,
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

Given:
- Initial price \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars,
- Rate of increase \( r = 0.20 \) (20%),
- Number of periods \( n = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \).

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ P = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 20 \times 38.3376 \]
\[ P \approx 766.752 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:

\[ P \approx 766.75 \]

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the given conditions and then solve for the unknowns.

Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age and \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Next, substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we have Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

2. Let \( S_4 \) represent the age of Sally Four.
3. Let \( G_R \) represent the age of Granny Red.
4. Let \( S_2 \) represent the age of Sally Two.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- \( S_{32} = 8 \) (Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old)
- \( S_4 = S_{32} \) (Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo)
- \( G_R = 2 \times S_4 \) (Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four)
- \( S_2 = G_R + 3 \) (Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red)

First, we substitute the known values:
- \( S_4 = 8 \) (since \( S_4 = S_{32} \))
- \( G_R = 2 \times 8 = 16 \) (since \( G_R = 2 \times S_4 \))
- \( S_2 = 16 + 3 = 19 \) (since \( S_2 = G_R + 3 \))

Now, we sum the ages of all four birds:
\[ S_{32} + S_4 + G_R + S_2 = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 \]

"To determine the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time required for both peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is:
  \[
  1.5 \, \text{minutes/potato} \times 60 \, \text{potatoes} = 90 \, \text{minutes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is:
  \[
  5 \, \text{seconds/potato} \times 60 \, \text{potatoes} = 300 \, \text{seconds}
  \]

To convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:
  \[
  300 \, \text{seconds} \div 60 \, \text{seconds/minute} = 5 \, \text{minutes}
  \]

Now, we add the peeling and cutting times together to get the total prep time:
\[
90 \, \text{minutes} + 5 \, \text{minutes} = 95 \, \text{minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we start by calculating the number of votes the winner received. Given that the winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes and the total number of votes is 80, we can calculate the winner's votes as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Next, we subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

"To solve this problem, we will use algebra to determine the number of red roses Sandra ordered and how many Fred must deliver by 5 pm.

Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. According to the problem:

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations:
   \[
   \text{Number of red roses} = 4C
   \]

2. Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations:
   \[
   200 = 5C
   \]

To find \( C \), we solve the equation:
\[
C = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now, we substitute \( C = 40 \) back into the equation for the number of red roses:
\[
\text{Number of red roses} = 4C = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Since Fred has not delivered any red roses yet, he must deliver all 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem.

Let \( J \) represent Jean's age, \( M \) represent Mark's age, and we know Jan's age is 30.

1. **Relationship between Jean and Mark:**
   Jean is two years older than Mark:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]

2. **Relationship involving Mark and Jan two years ago:**
   Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old (since Jan is currently 30):
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{28}{2} + 5
   \]
   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5
   \]
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides to solve for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

3. **Determine Jean's age:**
   Using the first equation \( J = M + 2 \):
   \[
   J = 21 + 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 23
   \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning margin between the two teams in the 4 by 400 meter relay, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the race and then find the difference between these times.

**Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team):**
- Each of the four runners completes their 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team 1: \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- The first runner completes their 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so they complete their 400 meters in \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they complete their 400 meters in \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they complete their 400 meters in \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds.
- Total time for Team 2: \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in their total times:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \]

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To address the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two specific events and then determine the relative likelihood of one event compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{\text{Number of even numbers}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"
"Given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many, we can calculate the total number of apples they both picked as follows:

Jenna's apples = 1/2 * Mother's apples
Jenna's apples = 1/2 * 20
Jenna's apples = 10

Total apples picked = Mother's apples + Jenna's apples
Total apples picked = 20 + 10
Total apples picked = 30

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

Let \( r \) represent the number of rats in each cage. We know the following:
- There are 3 cages of rats.
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, each with one hamster, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
- The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces/cage} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we set up the equation for the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:
\[ 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces/rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

The total number of pieces of straw distributed is the sum of the straw given to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides to isolate the term with \( r \):
\[ 18r = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18 to solve for \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we use the compound interest formula:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the given information.

Let \( x \) represent the number of bags the trader bought and sold.

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30. Thus, the profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit made by the trader is $400. We can express this as:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement and then convert it to a daily amount.

1. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
   \[
   3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

2. To find the daily requirement, we divide the total weekly requirement by 7 days:
   \[
   35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine the final number of trees Tom has left, we need to follow a step-by-step approach, considering the initial number of trees, the annual changes, and the percentage of trees that die after 10 years.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Thus, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[

"To determine how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and placed back in the yard.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given:

1. Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Each plate costs $6000.

First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:
\[ 20 \text{ dozen} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, calculate the cost of each cup:
\[ \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we set up the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

Given:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

Thus, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find the time \( t \) it takes for Gary to walk this distance. The time \( t \) is given by the formula:

\[ t = \frac{distance}{speed} \]

Given Gary's walking speed:
- Speed = 3 miles per hour

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, given the total number of customers over three days and the counts for the first two days.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the given conditions and solve for the unknowns.

Let \( S \) represent the current amount of water in the small pool, and \( B \) represent the current amount of water in the big pool.

Given:
1. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
2. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
3. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, we express the amounts of water in the pools 4 minutes ago:
- 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since it lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons (since it lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).

From the given conditions, we can write the following equations:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 4S
   \]

We substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
\[
4S - 2S = 32 - 16
\]
\[
2S = 16
\]
\[
S = 8
\]

Thus, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Lori wants to buy and then determine how many hours she needs to work to earn that amount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt:
- Cost of the shoes: $320.00
- Cost of the belt: $32.00

Total cost:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. She earns $8.00 per hour, so we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, including the 10% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount she will pay over the 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount due**

The principal amount borrowed is $2000. The interest rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Interest} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount due is:

\[ \text{Total Amount Due} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months**

Janeth pays $165 each month for 12 months.

\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining balance**

The remaining balance is the total amount due minus the total amount paid.

\[ \text{Remaining Balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

\[ 220 \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of flower in the vase. We know there are 4 roses. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias can be calculated as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Next, we find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

"Given the problem, we can use algebra to determine the current and future ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then calculate their average age in three years.

1. Let \( H \) represent Harriet's current age. According to the problem, \( H = 21 \).

2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   A = 3H
   \]
   Substituting \( H = 21 \):
   \[
   A = 3 \times 21 = 63
   \]

3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   H = \frac{Z}{2}
   \]
   Solving for \( Z \):
   \[
   Z = 2H
   \]
   Substituting \( H = 21 \):
   \[
   Z = 2 \times 21 = 42
   \]

4. In three years, their ages will be:
   - Harriet: \( H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 \)
   - Adrian: \( A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66 \)
   - Zack: \( Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45 \)

5. The average age of the three in three years is:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{(H + 3) + (A + 3) + (Z + 3)}{3}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we start by analyzing the given information and applying basic arithmetic and algebraic principles.

1. **Total points scored by all four students**: 251 points.
2. **Naomi's score**: 68 points.

Next, we calculate the scores for Yuri and Brianna:

- **Yuri's score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score.
  - Half of Naomi's score: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
  - Yuri's score: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

- **Brianna's score**: Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi's score.
  - Brianna's score: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we sum the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after the changes, we first need to calculate the new total number of cards and the new number of water type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

The new total number of cards is:
- 30 fire type cards
- 34 grass type cards
- 32 water type cards

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ P(\text{Water type}) = \frac{32}{96} \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

"When dealing with the problem of determining the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we can break it down into steps using our expertise in percentages and fractions.

Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons. When Ashlyn first visited the farm, 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest. To find this number, we calculate 30% of 120:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

This means 36 watermelons were ready and taken home by Ashlyn. The remaining watermelons, which were not ready, can be calculated as:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

Two weeks later, Ashlyn returned to the farm. At this point, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find this number, we calculate 3/4 of 84:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

So, 63 watermelons were ready and harvested. The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

"Given the problem, we can set up the following algebraic equations based on the information provided:

Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.
Let \( J \) represent the number of candies John has.
Let \( M \) represent the number of candies James has.

From the problem, we know:
1. John has twice as many candies as Robert: \( J = 2R \)
2. John has 54 candies: \( J = 54 \)
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert: \( M = R + 6 \)

First, we solve for \( R \) using the equation \( J = 2R \):
\[ 54 = 2R \]
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we solve for \( M \) using the equation \( M = R + 6 \):
\[ M = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find how many more candies John has than James:
\[ J - M = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Mike spends writing letters each week. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Determine the number of active pen pals:**
   Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3
   \]
   So, Mike has 3 active pen pals.

2. **Calculate the total number of letters received per week:**
   Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week.
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]
   So, Mike receives 6 letters each week.

3. **Determine the total number of pages to be written in response:**
   Each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike responds in kind.
   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30
   \]
   So, Mike needs to write 30 pages each week.

4. **Calculate the total time spent writing:**
   Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   \[
   30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   So, Mike spends 180 minutes writing each week.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   \[
   \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   So, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, using our expertise in arithmetic and problem-solving.

1. **Initial Fries:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries Taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries Taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries Given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries Taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem.

Let \( J_a \) represent the number of apples Jamal has, and \( J_b \) represent the number of bananas Jamal has. We are given the following information:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:
   \[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
   \[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]

4. Andrea has 52 apples:
   \[ A_a = 52 \]

First, we substitute the value of \( A_a \) into the first equation to find \( J_a \):
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the value of \( J_a \) to find \( J_b \):
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
- The total number of stitches for the entire sweater is 1800.

Let \( x \) be the number of stitches for each sleeve. Since there are two sleeves, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is \( 2x \).

The equation for the total number of stitches is:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 + 2x = 1800 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1170 + 2x = 1800 \]

Subtract 1170 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 630 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 315 \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the given conditions and then solve for Sam's current age.

Let \( S \) represent Sam's current age and \( R \) represent Ruby's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[
3S = 18
\]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[
S = 6
\]

Thus, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the given information.

Let \( x \) represent the number of sterling silver beads used in each necklace.

1. **Total length of the necklace:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.

2. **Length occupied by topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

3. **Length occupied by sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch long.
   - The total length occupied by the sterling silver beads is \( \frac{1}{4}x \) inches.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - The sum of the lengths of the topaz gemstones and the sterling silver beads equals the total length of the necklace.
   \[
   8 + \frac{1}{4}x = 25
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}x = 25 - 8
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}x = 17
   \]
   - Multiply both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 17 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   x = 68
   \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

First, we calculate the number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of stars in the two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of chocolate bars. Given that there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we determine the total number of chocolate bars that the 4 adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total for the adults is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars the adults receive from the total number of chocolate bars gives us the number of chocolate bars left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will receive:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using basic arithmetic and algebra.

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, where each member consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and they eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily consumption per person:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat twice a day:
   \[
   0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 0.4 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total daily consumption for the household:**
   There are 5 members in the household:
   \[
   0.4 \text{ kg/day/person} \times 5 \text{ people} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly consumption for the household:**
   There are 7 days in a week:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:**

"To determine the number of minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first calculate the total exercise time for Sunday and Monday. 

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. Adding these times together gives:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter's goal is to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, we multiply the total time by 2:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to meet his goal.

"To solve the problem of determining how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the pages when the paper is folded. Each piece of paper, when folded, can hold 4 pages: two on the front and two on the back.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can hold:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} \]

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is:

"To solve this problem, we start with the total amount Annika brought to the fair, which is $50. She spent half of this amount on food and snacks, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Amount spent on food and snacks} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 25 + 10 = 35 \]

To find out how much money Annika has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

\[ \text{Amount left} = 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Thus, the amount of money Annika has left is $15.

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow a systematic approach using algebra.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of books sold in the current year.
- \( 2x \) as the number of books sold in the first year (since she sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year).
- \( y \) as the number of books sold in the second year.

We are given:
- The total number of books initially is 250.
- The number of unsold books is 50.
- The number of books sold in the current year is 45.

First, we calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
\[ \text{Total books sold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Next, we set up the equation for the total number of books sold:
\[ 2x + y + x = 200 \]

Since \( x = 45 \):
\[ 2(45) + y + 45 = 200 \]
\[ 90 + y + 45 = 200 \]
\[ 135 + y = 200 \]
\[ y = 200 - 135 \]
\[ y = 65 \]

So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
1300"
"To determine Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus, given that the company performed very well for the entire month.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - Number of weeks in April: \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.29 \) weeks.
   - Total working days in April: \( 4.29 \times 5 = 21.45 \) days.
   - Since Watson cannot work a fraction of a day, we round down to 21 days.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Number of weeks in April: 4 weeks.
   - Total bonus for April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2100.
   - Total bonus: $1200.
   - Total earnings: \( 2100 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3300 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Watson made $3300 in April.

"To determine the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon, we start by calculating the number of loaves sold in the morning:

- The bakery produces 60 loaves each day.
- Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning: 
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
  \]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

- Total loaves produced: 60
- Loaves sold in the morning: 40
- Loaves remaining: 
  \[
  60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
  \]

Then, we determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening:

- Half of the remaining loaves: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
  \]
- These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so each period sells:
  \[
  \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
  \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses, given their different rates of weight loss.

First, let's find Joey's weekly weight loss:
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
- Therefore, Joey's weekly weight loss is:
  \[
  \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
  \]

Next, we need to determine Sandy's rate of weight loss:
- Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week.
- Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.
- Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:
  \[
  \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:
- Sandy's weekly weight loss is 0.5 pounds.
- To lose 8 pounds, the number of weeks required is:
  \[
  \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
  \]

Thus, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To solve the problem of determining the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for 15 days, we need to break down the growth rates for arms and legs and then sum the results.

1. **Growth Rate for Arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ new arms}
     \]

2. **Growth Rate for Legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ new legs}
     \]

3. **Total Number of New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ new arms} + 3 \text{ new legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Theo spends on his business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket, and then determine how much he has left to spend on gifts after saving $2000.

1. **Calculate the cost of the business suits:**
   - Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   - Total cost of suits = 6 * $100 = $600

2. **Calculate the cost of the suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   - Total cost of suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

3. **Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - Cost of one business suit = $100
   - 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
   - Total cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

4. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   - Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

5. **Determine the amount Theo has left after saving $2000:**
   - Theo has $6000 initially.
   - He wants to save $2000.
   - Amount available for spending = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

6. **Calculate the amount left for buying gifts:**
   - Amount left for gifts = Amount available for spending - Total expenses
   - Amount left for gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we start by calculating the daily consumption and then extend that to a weekly total.

1. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Three family members consume 3 eggs each per day: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
   - The remaining two family members consume 2 eggs each per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
   - Total daily consumption: \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

2. **Weekly Consumption:**
   - Since the family eats eggs every day, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
   - Total weekly consumption: \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"Given the relationships between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( T = J + 5 \) (Trent is 5 years older than Jane)
2. \( J = Q - 3 \) (Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn)

We are given that Quinn is 30 years old, so \( Q = 30 \).

Substituting \( Q = 30 \) into the second equation:
\[ J = 30 - 3 \]
\[ J = 27 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ T = 27 + 5 \]
\[ T = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we will use algebra to express the relationships and solve for the unknowns. Let's denote the current population of Chile as \( P \).

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera's age was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah's age was \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) years.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah's current age is \( 20 + 6 = 26 \) years.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \( 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \( P \) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \( 60000 = \frac{P}{2} \).
   - Solving for \( P \), we get \( P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \( 120000 \).

"To solve the problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the given information. Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense. According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2D + 4D + D = 210 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils that Jam and her sister, Meg, have, we start by calculating the number of pencils in each of Jam's boxes.

Given:
- Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils.
- Meg has 46 pencils.

First, we find the number of pencils in each of Jam's boxes. Let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we calculate the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils, given that each box holds 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream, and how these affect the strength of the coffee.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we will use basic arithmetic to track the number of people on the bus at each stop.

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. Therefore, the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. The number of people on the bus after this stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. Therefore, we set up the equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time required to charge the phone from 60% to 100%. 

First, calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed:
\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find the total time required to charge 40 percentage-points, we use the following calculation:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage-points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage-point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Determine the total discount applied using the rewards and the coupon.
3. Subtract the total discount from the current shopping trip's total.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \]

So, the customer earned 4 rewards.

**Step 2: Determine the total discount applied using the rewards and the coupon.**

The customer used all 4 rewards, and the coupon took twice the amount of the rewards off the price.

\[ \text{Discount from rewards} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Discount from coupon} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

The total discount is the sum of the discount from the rewards and the coupon.

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total discount from the current shopping trip's total.**

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip.

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \]

Therefore, the customer paid:

\[ 31 \]"
"To determine which job offers a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2,000
- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2,000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given conditions.

Let \( x \) represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of these groups, so it has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating the variable. First, add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

Now, we find the number of students in the smallest group by substituting \( x \) back into the expression \( x - 10 \):
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve the problem, we can use algebra to determine the number of chickens and cows, and then calculate the total number of legs.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows. According to the problem, the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, so we can represent the number of chickens as \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is given as 60. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
C + 2C = 60
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
3C = 60
\]

Solving for \( C \):
\[
C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
\]

So, there are 20 cows. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows:
\[
2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for the cows is:
\[
20 \times 4 = 80
\]

The total number of legs for the chickens is:
\[
40 \times 2 = 80
\]

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"To determine how many days the train can operate before needing service, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one complete trip and then find out how many days it takes to reach the service threshold of 18,000 miles.

1. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
   - Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
   - Distance from the third city to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

   Total distance for one complete trip:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes 3 trips a day.
   - Total distance per day:
   \[
   300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Determine how many days the train can go before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   - Number of days before service:
   \[
   \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, the train goes between services every 20 days.

"Let's denote the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 3 \).

Next, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is given by \( 4M - 5 \). Substituting \( M = 3 \):
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

The total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( O \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
\[ M + (4M - 5) + 3(4M - 5) + O = 50 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50 \]

Simplifying the left side:

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount ($3,650),
   - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (10% or 0.10),
   - \( t \) is the time in years (5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) years).

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   I = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   \[
   A = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   A = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   The monthly payment is the total amount divided by the number of months:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{A}{n}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of months (5).

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}

"To determine the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use algebra to set up and solve an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Thus, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of boys and girls in the choir. Given that the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since the performance is with just the female members, we initially have 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

"To determine the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes

2. **Convert all times to the same unit (minutes):**
   - Writing the song: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
   - Recording the song: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes

3. **Calculate the total work time:**
   - Total work time = 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes

4. **Determine the percentage of the total work time spent editing:**
   - Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
   - Percentage spent editing = (90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the meat and cheese required to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Total number of people = 20.
   - Number of sandwiches required = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the given information to set up equations.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cannolis and \( K \) represent the number of corns.

From the problem, we know:
1. Initially, there are 40 cannolis: \( C = 40 \).
2. There are twice as many corns as cannolis: \( K = 2C \).

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( K \):
\[ K = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis:
\[ C_{\text{new}} = C + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis:
\[ K_{\text{new}} = C_{\text{new}} - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we find the combined total of the new number of corns and cannolis:
\[ \text{Combined total} = C_{\text{new}} + K_{\text{new}} = 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We know the following:

- Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps.
- He completed half of his steps (5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
- He did an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:

\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with his friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Next, we know that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps he had taken by the end of his jog is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ (goal)} - 2,000 \text{ (steps left)} = 8,000 \text{ steps} \]

To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we subtract the number of steps he had taken before his jog from the total number of steps he had taken by the end of his jog:

\[ 8,000 \text{ (total steps by end of jog)} - 6,000 \text{ (steps before jog)} = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To solve the problem, we will use algebra to set up and solve the equation based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- \( J_t \) as the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.
- \( J_s \) as the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
- \( J_a \) as the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
- \( S_t \) as the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the tallest trees.
- \( S_s \) as the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.
- \( S_a \) as the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the average trees.

From the problem, we know:
- \( J_t = 30 \)
- \( J_s = \frac{J_t}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)
- \( S_t = 2 \times J_t = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- \( S_s = 3 \times J_s = 3 \times 15 = 45 \)
- \( S_a = 0 \)

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ J_t + J_s + J_a + S_t + S_s + S_a = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 30 + 15 + J_a + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + J_a = 500 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):

\[ J_a = 500 - 150 \]
\[ J_a = 350 \]

Thus, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each, so:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, we solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( D = 180 - C \) into the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we substitute this value back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

2. The comb fell 4,000 feet: 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet
3. Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet

To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, and then find the difference between these original prices.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of birds attracted to Lillian's garden based on the number of homemade and store-bought bird feeders and their respective bird attraction rates.

1. **Homemade Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of homemade feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per homemade feeder: 20 + 10 = 30 birds

2. **Store-Bought Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of store-bought feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per store-bought feeder: 20 birds

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Thus, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To determine the number of cards Kenny started with, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

Let \( C \) represent the total number of cards Kenny initially had. According to the problem, Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards and sells the remaining \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. Each card is sold for $1.5.

The total amount of money Kenny makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Total money} = \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so the total amount of money he makes is:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Setting up the equation:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]
\[ C = 150 \]

Thus, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

26"

"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order after applying the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so \( 5 \times 5.00 = 25.00 \).

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

"To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we first calculate the total cost of these items:

- Cost of the skipping rope: $6
- Cost of the board game: $11
- Cost of the playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Money saved from her allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of candy bars George bought.

1. **Total amount spent:**
   - George initially had $5 and had 1% of his money left, which is \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of candy bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   - The total cost for the candy bars is \( 0.75x \) dollars.

4. **Equation for total spending:**
   - The total amount spent on chips and candy bars is the sum of the costs of the chips and the candy bars.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     1.20 + 0.75x = 4.95
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 1.20 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     0.75x = 4.95 - 1.20
     \]
     \[
     0.75x = 3.75
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.75:
     \[
     x = \frac{3.75}{0.75}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To solve this problem, we start with the total number of lollipops Ray had, which is 25. Ray decided to keep 5 lollipops for himself, so the number of lollipops he shared is:

25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

These 20 lollipops were then shared equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

Thus, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the weight of each piece of cake. Given that the cake weighs 20 ounces and is divided into 8 equal pieces, the weight of each piece is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each piece} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the total weight of the cake they have consumed is:

\[ \text{Total weight consumed} = 2.5 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the consumed pieces from the total weight of the cake:

\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by using the given information: the area of the room is 360 square feet, and the length of the room is 3 yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the total number of eggs from the cases is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass requires 5 eggs, so:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

"To solve this problem, let's set up an algebraic equation based on the given information.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( P \) be the regular price of the popcorn.
   - The cost of the soda is given as $3.
   - The cost of a movie ticket is $12.

2. **Total cost without the super ticket:**
   - The total cost without the super ticket is the sum of the movie ticket, the soda, and the popcorn:
     \[
     12 + 3 + P = 15 + P
     \]

3. **Total cost with the super ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20 and includes the movie and one popcorn with a soda for an additional $1:
     \[
     20 + 1 = 21
     \]

4. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. Therefore, the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket:
     \[
     15 + P = 21 - 2

"To determine the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then use these to find the average speed.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required to fill the 10 raised beds. Each raised bed is a rectangular prism with dimensions 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.

The volume \( V \) of a single raised bed is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags required is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To solve the problem, we need to translate the given conditions into an algebraic equation. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We are given that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Thus, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that this combined length represents.

First, let's convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 6 inches to feet:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} \times \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the combined length of the two remoras:

\[ 2 \text{ remoras} \times 0.5 \text{ feet/remora} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage 1 foot is of the shark's 10-foot length. We use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 0.1 \times 100\% = 10\% \]

"To solve the problem, we can use algebra to set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the total number of students at the grade level. According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

We can set up the equation as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion from set theory. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. This is given by the union of sets \( A \) and \( B \):

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids in \( A \cup B \) from the total number of kids in the class:

\[
\text{Total number of kids} = 32
\]

\[
\text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of kids not allergic to anything is:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of songs Luri has on his media player. Given that Gabriel has 20 songs and Luri has 3 times as many, we compute:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we determine how many more songs each can add to their media players, which have a capacity of 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

\[ \text{Difference} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Thus, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up and solve an equation based on the given costs.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem and then solve for the unknowns.

Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found, \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found, and \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (Total number of insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more insects than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half as many insects as Bodhi)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( D = 9 \) back into the equations for \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we first need to add the fractions of the skein they each used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

First, let's add these fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4. We convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

1. The chair is 3 feet wide: \( c = 3 \)
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair: \( r = c + 5 \)
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug: \( l = 2r + 2 \)

First, substitute the value of \( c \) into the equation for \( r \):
\[ r = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, substitute the value of \( r \) into the equation for \( l \):
\[ l = 2(8) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs were strawberry.
- 1 pack was grape, costing $2.
- 1 pack was green apple, costing half as much as the grape pack, so $1.

The total cost of all the gum was $7. We can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Here, \( S \) represents the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. Now, let's solve for \( S \):

1. Combine the known costs:
   \[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):

"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to analyze the cost and yield of each type of wood and then determine the optimal combination within his budget.

1. **Cost and Yield Analysis:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Cost per Stick:**
   - For 2 x 4 wood: \( \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{200 \text{ sticks}} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick} \)
   - For 2 x 8 wood: \( \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{400 \text{ sticks}} = 0.015 \text{ dollars per stick} \)

4. **Optimal Purchase Strategy:**
   - Since the 2 x 8 wood provides a lower cost per stick, it is more cost-effective. However, we need to check if buying only 2 x 8 wood maximizes the number of sticks within the budget.

5. **Calculating the Maximum Number of 2 x 8 Pieces:**
   - Each 2 x 8 piece costs $6.
   - With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

6. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks from 2 x 8 Wood:**
   - Each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks.
   - Therefore, 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood will provide \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

7. **Verification with 2 x 4 Wood:**
   - For comparison, if he buys only 2 x 4 wood:
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Given the cost and yield analysis, the optimal strategy is to buy the 2 x 8 wood to maximize the number of sticks.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let \( L \) represent the cost of the lot and \( H \) represent the cost of the house.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

With the value of \( L \) known, we can find \( H \) using the second equation:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:

"To solve this problem, we need to apply principles of proportional reasoning, specifically focusing on the relationship between the number of workers and the time required to complete a task.

Given:
- One person can paint half a house in 5 days.

First, we determine the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house:
- If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take the same person \(5 \times 2 = 10\) days to paint a whole house.

Next, we convert the time from days to hours:
- There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is equivalent to \(10 \times 24 = 240\) hours.

Now, we consider the effect of having 5 people working together:
- If 5 people are working together, the total time required to paint the house is divided by 5. Therefore, the time it would take 5 people to paint a whole house is \(240 \div 5 = 48\) hours.

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given and then solve for the unknowns.

Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
3. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
4. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).

First, we use the information that Ophelia has 20 sofas to find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, and the total amount he paid is $48. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

To find the cost of the headphone set, we solve for \( H \):

\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we can set up the following equation to find the number of additional CDs, \( C \):

\[ 4C = 44 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = \frac{44}{4} \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To solve the problem, let's use algebraic reasoning.

Let \( J \) represent Jame's current age and \( C \) represent his cousin's current age.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, \( J + 5 = 27 \).
   - Solving for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 27 - 5 = 22

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( J + 8 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Therefore, \( C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5 \).
   - Substitute \( J = 22 \) into the equation:
     \[
     C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
     \]
     \[
     C + 8 = 2(30) - 5

3. \( P = C - 400 \)

First, substitute \( C = 1100 \) into the third equation to find \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 1100 \) and \( P = 700 \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate \( 2M \):
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells each girl brought back based on the information given.

1. Each boy brought back 60 seashells.
2. Each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 60 \).

The number of seashells each girl brought is given by:
\[ G = B + 4B \]
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"Let's denote the number of candies George originally had as \( G \). According to the problem, after George ate 5 candies, he has 3 candies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ G - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 3 + 5 \]
\[ G = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can express the number of candies Nick has as:

\[ N = 2G \]

Substituting \( G = 8 \) into the equation:

\[ N = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ N = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we will calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, which is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Performing the addition step-by-step:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the daily savings amount for the second half of April, given that Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half of April is \( 2x \).

2. **Calculate the total savings for each half of the month:**
   - The first half of April has 15 days, so the total savings in the first half is \( 15x \).
   - The second half of April also has 15 days, so the total savings in the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
     \[
     15x + 30x = 1125
     \]

4. **Combine like terms and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45}
   \]
   \[
   x = 25
   \]

5. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - The amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
     \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"To solve the problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad receives. According to the problem, Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff receives \( 4B \).

The total amount of money to be divided is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff receives 4 times the amount Brad receives, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Thus, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls in a phone tree where each person calls 3 other families, we can model this as a geometric sequence. Each term in the sequence represents the number of families called in each round.

The general form of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)} \]
where:
- \( a_n \) is the number of families called in the \( n \)-th round,
- \( a_1 \) is the number of families called in the first round,
- \( r \) is the common ratio (the number of families each person calls),
- \( n \) is the round number.

In this problem:
- \( a_1 = 3 \) (Ali calls 3 families in the first round),
- \( r = 3 \) (each family calls 3 other families),
- \( n = 4 \) (we are interested in the fourth round).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ a_4 = 3 \cdot 3^{(4-1)} \]
\[ a_4 = 3 \cdot 3^3 \]
\[ a_4 = 3 \cdot 27 \]
\[ a_4 = 81 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information. Let \( S \) represent Shiloh's current age and \( N \) represent his nephew's current age.

We know:
1. Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, we can write the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, for three teeth, the total is \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount she received for each of the previous three teeth, which is \(0.50\) dollars per tooth. Therefore, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum these amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: \(5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00\) dollars

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

"Given the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided:

Let \( R \) represent the number of goals Richie scored.
Let \( M \) represent the number of goals Mark scored.
Let \( A \) represent the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( R = M + 20 \)
2. \( R = A + 45 \)
3. \( R = 80 \)

First, we substitute \( R = 80 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
\[ M = 80 - 20 \]
\[ M = 60 \]

Next, we substitute \( R = 80 \) into the second equation to find \( A \):
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]
\[ A = 80 - 45 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[ R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 \]
\[ R + M + A = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
175"

"To address the issue with Maggie's oven, we need to use proportional reasoning to determine the correct setting for the desired temperature of 520 degrees. The oven is currently off by a certain percentage, which we can calculate and then apply to the new temperature setting.

First, let's determine the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees:

1. The actual temperature when set to 450 degrees is 468 degrees.
2. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
3. The percentage by which the oven is off is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:

\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the durations of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

First, let's convert the duration of the first movie:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes.
- Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the duration of the second movie:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours = 120 minutes.
- Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of both movies:
- Total time = 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

Thus, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we first calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount applied.

1. The original price for one box is $100.00.
2. The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is:
   \[
   100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00
   \]
3. The discounted price per box is:
   \[
   100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00
   \]
4. The total cost for 2 boxes is:
   \[
   2 \times 90.00 = 180.00
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of contacts and the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes.

1. Each box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes contain:
   \[
   2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ contacts}
   \]
2. Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the number of pairs of contacts is:
   \[
   \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ pairs}
   \]

Finally, we determine the cost per pair of contacts.

1. The total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00, and there are 90 pairs of contacts, so the cost per pair is:
   \[
   \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

\[
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[
3B = 4500
\]

Solving for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
\]

Now, we can determine the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth of the beanstalk. The beanstalk doubles its height every day, starting from an initial height of 4 feet. We need to determine the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to exceed 20 feet.

The height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) can be expressed as:
\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
\[ 4 \times 2^n > 20 \]

First, let's solve the inequality:
\[ 2^n > \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ 2^n > 5 \]

Next, we find the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by testing successive values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 0 \):
  \[ 2^0 = 1 \]
  \[ 1 < 5 \]

- For \( n = 1 \):
  \[ 2^1 = 2 \]
  \[ 2 < 5 \]

- For \( n = 2 \):
  \[ 2^2 = 4 \]
  \[ 4 < 5 \]

- For \( n = 3 \):
  \[ 2^3 = 8 \]
  \[ 8 > 5 \]

Thus, the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies the inequality is \( n = 3 \).

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine the total grams of protein John consumes per week from mushrooms, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content in 200 grams by doubling the amount:
   \[
   \text{Protein in 200 grams} = 2 \times 3 \text{ grams} = 6 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so his daily protein intake from mushrooms is 6 grams.

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the total protein intake per week is:
   \[
   \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week}
   \]

Thus, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Hourly wage}} = \frac{3900}{15}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the angles in the triangle. Let the smallest angle be \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 2x + 3x = 180
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
6x = 180
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[
x = \frac{180}{6} = 30
\]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can determine the measures of the other two angles. The second angle is:

\[
2x = 2 \times 30 = 60
\]

The third angle, which is the largest angle, is:

\[
3x = 3 \times 30 = 90
\]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to calculate the speed of the plane.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

The speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa in pounds of chocolates per hour.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, his production rate is:
\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's production rate is:
\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:
\[ \text{Ruiz's total} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ \text{Marissa's total} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total production:
\[ \text{Total production} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

1. **First 4 hours:**
   - Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.50.
   - The total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \).
   - The total earnings from the first 4 hours are \( 60 \text{ cups} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

2. **Next 2 hours:**
   - Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.60.
   - The total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours is \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \).
   - The total earnings from the next 2 hours are \( 20 \text{ cups} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from both periods are \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow a series of arithmetic and unit conversion steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per mile is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Therefore, the total number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years it will take to reach this limit, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
     \[
     \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. This means the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:

\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

3. Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- The shirt costs $25.
- The shorts cost $35.
- Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:

"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Butter per dozen croissants**: It takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
2. **Butter for 4 dozen croissants**: Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants, we multiply the butter needed for 1 dozen by 4:
   \[
   4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound of butter}
   \]
3. **Butter for a week**: Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants each day for 7 days. Therefore, we multiply the daily butter requirement by 7:
   \[
   1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds of butter}
   \]

Thus, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two distinct periods: the initial 5 months and the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - The total initial funding is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

2. **Extended period:**
   - The total research time is 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months.
   - The extended period is 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.
   - The funding per month for the extended period is 50% more than the initial monthly funding.
   - Initial monthly funding: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.
   - Extended monthly funding: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.
   - Total cost for the extended 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for initial 5 months + Cost for extended 45 months

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to perform a series of unit conversions and rate calculations. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour:**
   - Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second.
   - There are 3600 seconds in one hour (60 seconds per minute * 60 minutes per hour).
   - Therefore, the speed in kb per hour is:
     \[
     20 \, \text{kb/second} \times 3600 \, \text{seconds/hour} = 72000 \, \text{kb/hour}
     \]

2. **Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:**
   - There are 1000 kb in 1 Mb.
   - Therefore, the speed in Mb per hour is:
     \[
     \frac{72000 \, \text{kb/hour}}{1000 \, \text{kb/Mb}} = 72 \, \text{Mb/hour}
     \]

Thus, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches and then determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow to the required height.

1. **Convert the height requirement to inches:**
   The height requirement is 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert 4 feet to inches:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the additional height Adam needs to grow:**
   Adam's current height is 40 inches. The additional height needed to meet the requirement is:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years required for Adam to grow the additional height:**
   Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the additional height needed by his annual growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to calculate his commission based on the profit from the car sales. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Total Sales Amount:**
   James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000.
   \[
   \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total sales minus the total acquisition cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission:**
   James receives a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{James's Commission} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500
   \]

Therefore, James made \(\boxed{17,500}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to apply our knowledge of percentages and basic arithmetic. Here’s the step-by-step process:

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the prices of the jewels and then calculate the total price.

Let \( D \) represent the price of a diamond jewel. According to the problem, \( D = 2000 \).

The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of a gold jewel \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[
G = \frac{4}{5}D
\]
Substituting \( D = 2000 \) into the equation:
\[
G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, the price of a silver jewel \( S \) can be expressed as:
\[
S = G - 400
\]
Substituting \( G = 1600 \) into the equation:
\[
S = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels. The total price \( T \) is the sum of the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
\[
T = D + G + S
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
T = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is \(4800\)."
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps**: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. **Truck Stamps**: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. **Rose Stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[
16 + 19 + 10 = 45
\]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the concept of relative speed in algebra. Here’s the step-by-step solution:

1. **Determine the relative speed:**
   - Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.
   - The relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is the difference in their speeds:
     \[
     \text{Relative speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The distance Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob is 75 miles.
   - Using the formula for time, which is \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\), we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time:**
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. 

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars per class.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate the number of customers each processes daily and then extend that to a weekly total.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Similarly, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( P \) represent the distance Paisley ran.
2. Let \( R \) represent the distance Reggie ran.
3. Let \( L \) represent the distance Lynn ran.

From the problem, we know:
- Paisley ran 4 miles: \( P = 4 \)
- Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran: \( R = 5P \)
- Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn: \( R = L + 3 \)

First, substitute the value of \( P \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 20 \) into the equation \( R = L + 3 \):
\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

Solve for \( L \):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The dimensions of the hole are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to shovel this volume of earth. Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic reasoning to determine the total sales over the two months.

Let \( R \) represent the sales from red hats in the first month, and \( G \) represent the sales from green hats in the first month. According to the problem, \( R = 400 \) and \( R = \frac{1}{2}G \).

First, we solve for \( G \):
\[ R = \frac{1}{2}G \]
\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2}G \]
\[ G = 2 \times 400 \]
\[ G = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total sales for the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = R + G \]
\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 \]
\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 1200 \]

In the second month, the sales are \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 \]
\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = 900 \]

Finally, we sum the total sales for both months:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required and then determine the number of whole eggs needed, converting that into dozens.

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
   \[
   \text{Total deviled egg halves} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Deviled egg halves per guest} = 16 \times 3 = 48
   \]

2. Determine the number of whole eggs required:
   \[
   \text{Number of whole eggs} = \frac{\text{Total deviled egg halves}}{\text{Deviled egg halves per whole egg}} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{\text{Number of whole eggs}}{12} = \frac{24}{12} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to break down the expenses into their components and then sum them up.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: This is a one-time expense.
   - Initial cost = $150,000

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental**: This is a recurring monthly expense.
   - Monthly hanger rental = $5,000

3. **Monthly Fuel Expenses**: This is also a recurring monthly expense, and it is twice the amount of the hanger rental.
   - Monthly fuel expenses = 2 * $5,000 = $10,000

4. **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost**: This is the sum of the monthly hanger rental and the monthly fuel expenses.
   - Total monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

5. **Annual Maintenance Cost**: This is the total monthly maintenance cost multiplied by the number of months in a year.
   - Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

6. **Total Cost for the First Year**: This is the sum of the initial cost of the plane and the annual maintenance cost.
   - Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To determine the total cooking time for all the food, we can set up the problem using algebraic expressions.

Let \( R \) represent the cooking time for rice. According to the problem, \( R = 30 \) minutes.

The cooking time for pork is 20 minutes more than the cooking time for rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork \( P \) is:
\[
P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

The cooking time for beans \( B \) is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
\[
R + P = 30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
\]
Thus, the cooking time for beans is:
\[
B = \frac{R + P}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

To find the total cooking time for all the food, we sum the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
\[
R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total cooking time for all the food is:

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of 1/5 pound of almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep and \( G \) represent the number of geese. We can write the following equations:

1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, we solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the amounts of money each person has.

Let \( A \) represent the amount of money Aurelia has. According to the problem, Aurelia has $120, so:
\[ A = 120 \]

Let \( K \) represent the amount of money Kassidy has. The problem states that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia:
\[ K = \frac{3}{4}A \]
Substituting \( A = 120 \):
\[ K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Let \( R \) represent the amount of money Rayna has. The problem states that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy:
\[ R = K + 60 \]
Substituting \( K = 90 \):
\[ R = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together:
\[ \text{Total} = A + K + R \]
Substituting the values we found:
\[ \text{Total} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the total amount equally among the three of them, each person would have:
\[ \text{Amount per person} = \frac{\text{Total}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Amount per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

Thus, each person would have 120 dollars if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them.

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the number of cookies each person has. Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

First, we express the extended length of the dress mathematically:
\[ \text{Extended length} = L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Next, we account for the 20 cm of lace trim added to the extended length:
\[ \text{Final length} = 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To isolate \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and subtract this from their total available time.

1. Time taken to get to the corner where the library is: 6 minutes
2. Time taken to get to the fire station from the library: 13 minutes

First, we add the time spent on both segments of their walk:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the total time spent from the total time they have to get to school:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Thus, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let \( L \) represent the cost of one lollipop and \( C \) represent the cost of one candy.

From the problem, we know:
1. Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total of $3.20.
2. Each lollipop costs $0.40.

We can write the first equation as:
\[ 5L + 4C = 3.20 \]

Given that each lollipop costs $0.40, we have:
\[ L = 0.40 \]

Substituting \( L = 0.40 \) into the first equation:
\[ 5(0.40) + 4C = 3.20 \]
\[ 2.00 + 4C = 3.20 \]

Next, we solve for \( C \):
\[ 4C = 3.20 - 2.00 \]
\[ 4C = 1.20 \]
\[ C = \frac{1.20}{4} \]
\[ C = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. Using the values of \( L \) and \( C \):
\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10L = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10C = 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"To determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then extend these to the total period.

First, let's calculate Neil's monthly savings. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. Therefore, the additional amount Neil saves each month is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil's total monthly savings are:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

5760"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the services and then determine how much money John leaves with after paying the bill.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - Each vaccine costs $20.
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost of vaccines: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let \( T \) be the total bill.
   - The cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.40:
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
     \]

5. **Calculate the amount John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - The total bill is $100.
   - Amount left: \( 125 - 100 = 25 \) dollars.

Therefore, John leaves with \(\boxed{25}\) dollars."
"To determine the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.50, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.00, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5.00
- Total cost for apples: $6.00
- Total cost for oranges: $21.00

The total price for the crate is \(5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find 30% of Adam's points:
   \[
   0.30 \times 50 = 15
   \]
   Therefore, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, Marta's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:

"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

Let \( G \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck in pounds.

We know the following:
- Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds.
- Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul \( 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \) pounds.
- The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

The equation representing the total capacity of the three trucks is:
\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 8,800 + G = 11,600 \]

To solve for \( G \), subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation:

"To determine Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% discount, we first calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to find the final total:

Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops of ice cream, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50, and Erin has $6.00.

First, let's determine how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Next, we calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 2 paid scoops gives her 1 free scoop, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can buy 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To determine the number of mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom, we start by calculating the area to be covered:

\[
\text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Simplifying the multiplication:

\[
\text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2 \times 36}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of tiles needed for this area, given that he needs 24 tiles per square foot:

\[
\text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft}
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
\text{Number of tiles} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

"To determine the savings James made by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to perform a cost comparison. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Cost of Picking Blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65
   \]

2. **Cost of Buying Blueberries at the Store:**
   - Cost per pound of blueberries at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Pounds
   \[
   \text{Total cost of buying} = 2.5 \times 30 = 75
   \]

3. **Savings Calculation:**
   - Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 75 - 65 = 10
   \]

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries compared to buying them at the store.

"To determine the number of pizza slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by Bryce and his four friends and then subtract this from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices available:**
   Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   Bryce and two friends each ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas.
   \[
   \text{Slices eaten per person} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]
   Since there are 3 people (Bryce and two friends):
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   The remaining two friends each ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas.
   \[
   \text{Slices eaten per person} = \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices}
   \]
   Since there are 2 people:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages.

First, let's establish the time it takes for each:

- The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.
- The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the dog's time is:
  \[
  \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we calculate the average time for both the cat and the dog:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To solve the problem, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Given that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, we convert the feet to inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:

\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the relationship given in the problem. The length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The equation based on the given relationship is:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total number of windows in students' cars = \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Number of windows smashed in students' cars = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total number of windows in teachers' cars = \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Number of windows smashed in teachers' cars = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \) windows.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( D \) represent Dora's age, \( F \) represent Dora's father's age, and \( M \) represent Dora's mother's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Dora's age \( D = 15 \).
2. Dora's father's age \( F \) is eight more than twice Dora's age.
3. Dora's mother's age \( M \) is four years younger than Dora's father's age.

First, we express Dora's father's age in terms of Dora's age:
\[ F = 2D + 8 \]

Substituting \( D = 15 \) into the equation:
\[ F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we express Dora's mother's age in terms of Dora's father's age:
\[ M = F - 4 \]

Substituting \( F = 38 \) into the equation:
\[ M = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"Given the problem, we can set up the following equations based on the information provided:

Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
- Clara has two times as many books as Steven: \( C = 2S \)
- Clara has 20 books: \( C = 20 \)

From the equation \( C = 2S \) and knowing \( C = 20 \), we can solve for \( S \):
\[ 20 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven:
\[ A = S + 6 \]

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boys in each class, given that the total number of students in two classes is 80, and each class has the same number of students. Additionally, 40% of the students in each class are girls.

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of girls in each class:**
   Given that 40% of the students in each class are girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   The number of boys in each class is the total number of students in the class minus the number of girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the trades Lorraine makes and convert all items to a common unit, which in this case will be small buttons.

1. **Initial Inventory:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trade 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \) small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

3. **Trade 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \) large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

4. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers = 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

5. **Total small buttons:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Small buttons from trading remaining large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons = 27 + 60 = 87

6. **Convert large buttons to small buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large buttons = \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total buttons in small button units:**
   - Total small buttons = 87 (from small stickers and remaining large stickers) + 60 (from large buttons) = 147

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

\[ 147 \]

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, and \( A \) represent the number of votes against it.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against: \( F = 2A \).
2. The total number of votes is 33: \( F + A = 33 \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( A \):

\[
F + A = 33
\]
\[
2A + A = 33
\]
\[
3A = 33

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of cases of shingles needed for each house using algebraic expressions.

Let \( x \) represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation. Let \( x \) represent the price at which Bennet sells each ear of corn. We know the following:

- Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, making a total of \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) dollars from the eggplants.
- Bennet has 25 ears of corn and wants to make a total of $135.

The total amount of money Bennet wants to make is the sum of the money from the eggplants and the money from the corn. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 60 + 25x = 135 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

1. Subtract 60 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 25x = 135 - 60 \]
\[ 25x = 75 \]

2. Divide both sides by 25 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{75}{25} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Thus, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for \( \boxed{3} \) dollars."

"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the travel time and the time spent at the museum.

1. **Calculate the travel time:**
   - The distance to the museum is 150 miles.
   - Jack drives at a speed of 75 miles per hour (mph).
   - The time to travel one way is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Since Jack drives to the museum and back, the total travel time is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time gone from home:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.
   - Adding the travel time to the time spent at the museum:

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance driven and the distance hiked.

1. **Distance Driven:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but 1.5 hours were spent hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
     \[
     6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Thus, the distance driven is:
     \[
     \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Distance Hiked:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. First, we calculate half the driving speed:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Then, we subtract 5 miles per hour to find the hiking speed:
     \[
     25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - The family hiked for 1.5 hours. Therefore, the distance hiked is:
     \[
     \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is \(\boxed{255}\) miles."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate the total points each earns based on the given scoring system and the differences in their performance.

1. **Scoring System:**
   - 10 points for each enemy jumped on.
   - 5 points for each berry collected.
   - 30 points for each second left on the timer.

2. **Emma's Performance:**
   - Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
   - Let \( T \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

   Emma's total score:
   \[
   \text{Emma's Score} = 10E + 5B + 30T
   \]

3. **Ava's Performance:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E + 8 \).
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B + 3 \).
   - Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

   Ava's total score:
   \[
   \text{Ava's Score} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)
   \]

4. **Simplify Ava's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Ava's Score} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Ava's Score} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
   \]

5. **Calculate the Difference in Scores:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Emma's Score} - \text{Ava's Score}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 10E - 5B - 30T + 25

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the rides on the usual days and the rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the given conditions and solve for the unknowns.

Initially, Bob has:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish. Let:
- \( x \) be the number of white fish Bob buys.
- \( y \) be the number of orange fish Bob buys.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

We can simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can harvest from his garden, we need to calculate the yield from both the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has planted 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has planted 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

"To determine the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we start by calculating Nikita's score. Given that Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we first find half of Pierson's score:

\[
\text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139
\]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:

\[
\text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we sum the scores of Pierson and Nikita to find the total:

\[
\text{Total score} = 278 + 150 = 428

"To determine the total number of trees planted in Ashley's school reforestation campaign, we need to calculate the contributions from both the students and the teachers.

1. **Number of Students:**
   - The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class.
   - Total number of students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

2. **Trees Planted by Students:**
   - Each student plants 1 tree.
   - Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

3. **Number of Teachers:**
   - The school has 40 classes, with 3 teachers per class.
   - Total number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

4. **Trees Planted by Teachers:**
   - Each teacher plants 2 trees.
   - Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

5. **Total Number of Trees Planted:**

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:
   - Stuffed puppies: 3
   - Stuffed koalas: 5
   - Stuffed zebras: 2
   - Stuffed frogs: 4

   Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

2. Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

3. We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
   \[
   x = 0.30 \times (14 + x)
   \]

4. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 0.30 \times (14 + x)
   \]
   \[
   x = 4.2 + 0.30x
   \]
   \[
   x - 0.30x = 4.2
   \]
   \[
   0.70x = 4.2
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4.2}{0.70}
   \]
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down the problem into two parts: the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the hours played in the following week.

1. **First 2 weeks:**
   - Kris plays for half an hour every day.
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - Total hours played in the first 2 weeks: \(0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours}\).

2. **Following week:**
   - Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total hours played in the following week: \(2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours}\).

3. **Total hours played so far:**
   - Sum of the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the following week: \(7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours}\).

4. **Hours needed to reach the achievement:**
   - Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement.
   - Hours still needed: \(30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours}\).

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the basic formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
- The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.
- Both cars travel for 2 hours.

First, we calculate the distance each car travels:

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   \[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   \[ \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"To determine the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the ratio of these two numbers.

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third grade: 340 out of 500 students passed.
   - Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 students passed.
   - Fifth grade: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth grade. The fourth grade's pass rate is 40/100 = 0.40, so the fifth grade's pass rate is 2 * 0.40 = 0.80. Therefore, 0.80 * 400 = 320 fifth graders passed.

2. **Calculate the total number of students who passed:**
   - Total passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students.

3. **Calculate the total number of students who took the test:**
   - Total students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.

4. **Calculate the overall pass rate:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of glass chips Milo has, the area of the mosaic he can create with those chips, and then the length of the mosaic given its height.

1. **Total Number of Glass Chips:**
   Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag contains 72 chips.
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Area of the Mosaic:**
   It takes 12 glass chips to make 1 square inch of the mosaic.
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. **Length of the Mosaic:**
   The mosaic is 3 inches tall. To find the length, we use the area and the height.
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Height} \times \text{Length}
   \]
   \[
   12 \text{ square inches} = 3 \text{ inches} \times \text{Length}
   \]
   Solving for the length:
   \[
   \text{Length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To determine the initial amount of tea in gallons at the beginning of the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students:
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. Add the tea consumed by both groups of students to find the total amount of tea consumed:
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
   \]

4. Add the remaining tea to the total amount consumed to find the initial amount of tea:
   \[
   38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
   \]

5. Convert the total quarts to gallons (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts):
   \[
   48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order**: Dale started with 100 candies.
2. **Candies Sold**: Dale sold 150 candies.
3. **Additional Order**: Dale then ordered 100 more candies.

First, we calculate the deficit after selling 150 candies:
\[ 150 - 100 = 50 \]
This means Dale needed 50 more candies to fulfill the 150 sold.

Next, Dale ordered 100 more candies. After fulfilling the 50 candies needed to complete the 150 sold, he has:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \]
So, Dale now has 50 candies left.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To address the problem of exponential growth in the number of students on campus, we can use the formula for exponential growth, which is given by:

\[ N(t) = N_0 \times 2^t \]

where:
- \( N(t) \) is the number of students at time \( t \),
- \( N_0 \) is the initial number of students,
- \( t \) is the time in months.

Given:
- \( N_0 = 10 \) students (initial number of students at the beginning of the year),
- \( t = 5 \) months (end of May).

We need to find the number of students at the end of May and then determine how many additional students have joined since the beginning of the year.

1. **Calculate the number of students at the end of May:**

\[ N(5) = 10 \times 2^5 \]
\[ N(5) = 10 \times 32 \]
\[ N(5) = 320 \]

So, there are 320 students on campus at the end of May.

2. **Determine the number of additional students who joined:**

The number of additional students is the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students:

\[ \text{Additional students} = N(5) - N_0 \]
\[ \text{Additional students} = 320 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Additional students} = 310 \]

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average number of branches Felix climbs per day based on his weekly earnings and the cost per branch.

First, we calculate the total number of branches climbed in the week:
- Felix charges $0.25 per branch.
- He made $105 in total.

The total number of branches climbed is:
\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, we find the average number of branches climbed per day:
- There are 7 days in a week.

The average number of branches climbed per day is:
\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches} \]

     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the next 4 flowers, each with 6 petals:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the next 5 flowers, each with 4 petals:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the last 6 flowers, each with 7 petals:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean have made their S'mores and account for the dropped marshmallows. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initial Marshmallows**: The bag contains 35 marshmallows.
2. **Marshmallows Used by John**: John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
3. **Marshmallows Used by DeSean**: DeSean makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
4. **Marshmallows Dropped**: They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
\[ 9 \text{ (John's S'mores)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean's S'mores)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, subtract the total number of marshmallows used and lost from the initial number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 \text{ (initial)} - 21 \text{ (used and lost)} = 14 \text{ marshmallows remaining} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since there are 2 kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
\[ \frac{14 \text{ marshmallows}}{2 \text{ kids}} = 7 \text{ S'mores per kid} \]

Thus, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

1. **Determine the play time per quarter for each person:**
   - Jack: 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend: \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):**
   - Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Two friends: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
   - One friend: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two friends: \( 24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)
   - One friend: 8 quarters

   Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \)

4. **Convert the total number of quarters to dollars:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( 4 \) ounces.

"Given that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can determine the initial number of cars Joe has:

\[ \text{Joe's initial cars} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find the number of cars he sells:

\[ \text{Cars sold} = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Therefore, the number of cars given away is:

\[ \text{Cars given away} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

To find the number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars, we subtract the cars sold and given away from his initial number of cars:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has, \( S \) represent the number of cards Smendrick has, and \( B \) represent the number of cards Becca has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The total number of cards is 341:
   \[
   P + S + B = 341
   \]
2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:
   \[
   B = S + 12
   \]
3. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has:
   \[
   S = 3P
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for \( P \).

First, substitute \( S = 3P \) into \( B = S + 12 \):
\[
B = 3P + 12
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 3P \) and \( B = 3P + 12 \) into the total cards equation:
\[
P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341
\]
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
7P = 329
\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[
P = 47
\]

Now, we can find the number of cards Smendrick and Becca have:
\[
S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]
\[
B = 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Milly will lose:

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Mulan has after receiving money from her father. She initially has $40 and her father gives her an additional $100. Therefore, her total amount is:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount spent. Mulan buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. The cost of the jeans is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Adding the cost of the bag:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount of money Mulan has:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

Thus, the amount of money Mulan has left is:

"To determine the production for the fourth week, we can break down the monthly production and the production for the first three weeks:

- Monthly production: 50,000 bars
- First week production: 8,000 bars
- Second week production: \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week production: \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Next, we sum the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Thus, the production for the fourth week is 14,000 bars.

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Mason travels at a speed of 8 miles per hour. He first travels for 4 hours, and then after a rest, he travels for another 6 hours.

First, we calculate the distance for the initial 4-hour segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance for the subsequent 6-hour segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both segments:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to apply principles of proportional reasoning and rates. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To solve the problem, we can use algebraic expressions to represent the number of clay dishes each person makes.

Let \( k \) represent the number of dishes Kora makes. According to the problem, Kora made 20 dishes:
\[ k = 20 \]

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, the number of dishes Rory makes, \( r \), can be expressed as:
\[ r = k + 20 \]
Substituting \( k = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ r = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, the number of dishes Jada makes, \( j \), can be expressed as:
\[ j = 2r \]
Substituting \( r = 40 \) into the equation:
\[ j = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

To find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we sum the number of dishes each person made:
\[ \text{Total} = k + r + j \]
Substituting the values we found:
\[ \text{Total} = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all her financial resources and the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the new laptop's cost to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let \( x \) represent the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine the number of apple slices left after Adam eats, we first calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Adam slices 3 large apples and 5 small apples.

First, calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, add the slices from both large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"Given the problem, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the number of socks and dishes each person has.

Let:
- \( S_J \) be the number of socks Jack has.
- \( D_J \) be the number of dishes Jack has.
- \( S_P \) be the number of socks Peter has.
- \( D_P \) be the number of dishes Peter has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack collected 60 dishes:
   \[
   D_J = 60
   \]
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks:
   \[
   D_J = 2S_J
   \]
   Substituting \( D_J = 60 \):
   \[
   60 = 2S_J \implies S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:
   \[
   S_P = 2S_J = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:
   \[
   D_P = \frac{D_J}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Now, we calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Total number of socks:
  \[
  S_J + S_P = 30 + 60 = 90
  \]
- Total number of dishes:
  \[
  D_J + D_P = 60 + 30 = 90

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[
90 + 90 = 180

"To determine the number of students good at math, we can use the principles of set theory. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( M \) be the set of students good at math.
- Let \( E \) be the set of students good at English.

We are given:
- \( |M \cap E^c| = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( |E \cap M^c| = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The total number of students in the class is 20.

We need to find \( |M| \), the number of students good at math. According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion for two sets, the total number of students can be expressed as:
\[ |M \cup E| = |M| + |E| - |M \cap E| \]

However, we can also express the total number of students as the sum of those good at math only, those good at English only, and those good at both:
\[ |M \cup E| = |M \cap E^c| + |E \cap M^c| + |M \cap E| \]

Given:
\[ |M \cup E| = 20 \]
\[ |M \cap E^c| = 5 \]
\[ |E \cap M^c| = 8 \]

We can substitute these values into the equation:
\[ 20 = 5 + 8 + |M \cap E| \]

Solving for \( |M \cap E| \):
\[ |M \cap E| = 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 \]

Now, the number of students good at math \( |M| \) is the sum of those good at math only and those good at both:
\[ |M| = |M \cap E^c| + |M \cap E| = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students good at math is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) of 300 dollars per year,
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, we need to convert the interest rate into a decimal form. Since the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, we have:

\[ r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

However, this is not the correct way to interpret the interest rate. The interest rate should be a fraction of the principal, not an absolute amount. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

\[ r = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

Now, we can calculate the simple interest:

\[ I = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ I = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ I = 675 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount after 3 years by adding the interest to the principal:

\[ A = P + I \]
\[ A = 300 + 675 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

\[
\boxed{975}

   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms:
   \[
   45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - The town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) homes.

3. **Third Year:**
   - The town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years.
   - Total homes built in the first two years: \( 12 + 36 = 48 \) homes.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \) homes.

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   - Sum of homes built in each year: \( 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \) homes.

Thus, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables based on the given relationships:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- My brother's age is \( x + 3 \).
- My sister's age is \( x - 2 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Then, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

Thus, I am 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy.

First, we calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to meet or exceed this total. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:
\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks:
\[ \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we start with the initial volume of water passing through the river, which is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the volume doubles, so we calculate the new volume as follows:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water increases by an additional 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total volume of water passing through the river on the third day is:

\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:

14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the infection. Initially, there are 10 infected people. Each day, each infected person infects 6 others. This can be modeled using the formula for exponential growth:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t \]

where:
- \( P(t) \) is the number of infected people at time \( t \),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial number of infected people,
- \( r \) is the growth rate per time period,
- \( t \) is the number of time periods.

In this scenario:
- \( P_0 = 10 \),
- \( r = 6 \) (since each person infects 6 others),
- \( t = 3 \) days.

However, since the growth rate \( r \) is not a fraction but a multiplier, we can simplify the formula to:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times 6^t \]

Now, let's calculate the number of infected people after 3 days:

\[ P(3) = 10 \times 6^3 \]

First, calculate \( 6^3 \):

\[ 6^3 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216 \]

Then, multiply by the initial number of infected people:

\[ P(3) = 10 \times 216 = 2160 \]

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is:

2160"
"To determine the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela, we start by calculating the tips received by Rafaela. Given that each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate Rafaela's total tips as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

1520"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of oranges Jennifer gave away and then subtract that from the total number of oranges she originally had.

Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which amounts to:
\[ 2 \text{ oranges/daughter} \times 3 \text{ daughters} = 6 \text{ oranges} \]

She also gave 3 oranges to her only boy. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is:
\[ 6 \text{ oranges} + 3 \text{ oranges} = 9 \text{ oranges} \]

Subtracting the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
\[ 12 \text{ oranges} - 9 \text{ oranges} = 3 \text{ oranges} \]

Thus, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges each person earns in one year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number of badges Amber earns.

1. **Claire's Badge Earning:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earning:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:**
   - There are 50 students, and each student received 10 burritos.
   - Total burritos for students = \( 50 \times 10 = 500 \) burritos.

2. **Account for the burritos eaten by Mr. George:**
   - Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos used:**
   - Total burritos used = burritos for students + burritos eaten by Mr. George
   - Total burritos used = \( 500 + 20 = 520 \) burritos.

4. **Determine the number of leftover burritos:**
   - Original number of burritos ordered = 600 burritos.
   - Total number of leftover burritos = original number of burritos - total number of burritos used

"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we can set up and solve a system of equations based on the given information.

1. Let \( R \) represent the number of red cars.
2. Let \( G \) represent the number of green cars.
3. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue cars.
4. Let \( Y \) represent the number of yellow cars.

From the problem, we know:
- The rink has 12 red cars: \( R = 12 \).
- The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars: \( G = R - 2 \).
- The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars: \( B = 3G \).
- The total number of cars is 75: \( R + G + B + Y = 75 \).

First, substitute the value of \( R \) into the equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, substitute the value of \( G \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, substitute the values of \( R \), \( G \), and \( B \) into the total number of cars equation:
\[ 12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75 \]

Simplify and solve for \( Y \):
\[ 52 + Y = 75 \]
\[ Y = 75 - 52 \]
\[ Y = 23 \]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given and then solve for the unknowns.

Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has, \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has, and \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of books is 85:
   \[
   S + A + F = 85
   \]
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25
   \]
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[
   A = F - 12
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into \( S = A + 25 \):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25
\]
\[
S = F + 13
\]

Now, substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the first equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85
\]
\[
3F + 1 = 85
\]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
3F = 84
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
F = 28
\]

Thus, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week on groceries, we start by calculating the total amount each person pays monthly. Given that the total monthly grocery cost is $400 and Madeline pays 60% of this amount, we can calculate Madeline's share as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find Keenan's share by subtracting Madeline's share from the total monthly cost:

\[ \text{Keenan's share} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the month is four weeks long, we divide Keenan's monthly share by 4 to find the weekly amount:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly share} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Keenan spends 40 dollars per week on groceries.

   - Unit cost of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

2. **Unit Cost of Water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Unit cost of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the desired quantities:

3. **Total Cost for 3 Bottles of Soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

4. **Total Cost for 2 Bottles of Water:**
   - 2 bottles of water * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of glasses of lemonade sold by each of the boys, Micah and Mitchell. Given that Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32, we can calculate the total number of glasses sold by the boys as follows:

Total glasses sold by the boys = Total glasses sold - Glasses sold by Julie
Total glasses sold by the boys = 32 - 14
Total glasses sold by the boys = 18

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2:

Glasses sold by each boy = Total glasses sold by the boys / 2
Glasses sold by each boy = 18 / 2
Glasses sold by each boy = 9

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:

More glasses sold by Julie = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
More glasses sold by Julie = 14 - 9
More glasses sold by Julie = 5

"To solve the problem, we start by determining Melanie's current age. Given that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for the current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find the number of years, \( x \), from now when Melanie's age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs of all the items:
     \[
     10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) represent the length of her usual concerts in minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore. The total duration of the final concert is given as 65 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
2x + 15 = 65
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x = 65 - 15
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
2x = 50
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{50}{2}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we find:

\[
x = 25
\]

Thus, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Chimichangas on Tuesday:**
   - The shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.

2. **Chimichangas on Wednesday:**
   - The shop makes 125 chimichangas on Wednesday.

3. **Chimichangas on Friday:**
   - The shop makes twice as many chimichangas on Friday as it does on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of chimichangas on Friday is \( 2 \times 125 = 250 \).

4. **Total chimichangas over the three days:**
   - We sum the number of chimichangas made on each day:
   \[
   125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500
   \]

Thus, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we start by calculating the number of microphones that won't fit. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't find any space, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

"To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to perform a few simple calculations.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
- Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic relationships to determine the speed of the whirligig. Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.

First, we can express the speed of the whatchamacallit in terms of \( T \):
\[ \text{Speed of whatchamacallit} = 11T \]

We know the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second:
\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we use the speed of the thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5T \]

Substituting \( T = 11 \) meters per second:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:
\[ 55 \]"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

Let \( J \) represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. According to the problem:
- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is:
\[ J + 3J + 5J = 9J \]

We are given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since the total payment of $6 is for all the lawns she mowed, we can assume that the $6 is the total payment for \( 9J \) times of mowing lawns. Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns is $6.

Tasha's total earnings from all activities (lemonade sales and mowing lawns) is $80. Let \( L \) represent the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. We can set up the following equation:

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the relationships and solve for the unknowns.

Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha originally had. According to the problem, Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):

\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, the number of notebooks Joseph had is:

\[ J = 3M \]
\[ J = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ J = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

"To solve this problem, we need to use proportional reasoning to determine the amount of material required for the specified number of masks.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago.

We can write the equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

"To solve the problem, we can use algebraic methods to set up and solve the equation based on the given information.

Let \( r \) represent the number of red balloons and \( y \) represent the number of yellow balloons. According to the problem:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There were 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of pieces of bologna thrown:

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the profit the class raised from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240.

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $240 - $150 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the problem step by step using arithmetic operations.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. **Fish**: Larry has 3 times the number of fish as rabbits.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has 1/3 the number of fish as gerbils.
   \[
   \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of rabbits} + \text{Number of fish} + \text{Number of gerbils}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of slices consumed by Abby and Josh each day and then calculate how many days the loaf of bread will last.

1. Abby eats 2 slices per day.
2. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means he eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices per day.
3. Together, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

Given that the loaf of bread has 24 slices, we can find the number of days the loaf will last by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together each day:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Slices eaten per day}} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
\]

Thus, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which has 10,000 gallons. Therefore, the initial amount of water in the tank is:

\[ \frac{10,000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we determine the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Thus, the total amount of water used over 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday.
2. Divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, add these numbers together to get the total:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's break it down step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

Next, we divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average:

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the given conditions and then solve for the unknowns.

Let:
- \( P \) be the age of Peter,
- \( L \) be the age of Paul,
- \( J \) be the age of Jean.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of boxes available for the yard sale. There are 10 people, each donating 5 boxes, and the charity group already has 10 boxes. 

First, we calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we add the 10 boxes already owned by the charity group:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can hold 2 boxes. Therefore, we need to determine the total number of tables required to accommodate all 60 boxes:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. To find out how many new tables are needed, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables required:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Thus, the number of new tables needed is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we start by calculating the hay requirements for the goats and the sheep separately.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

"John's total earnings for the week are calculated by multiplying his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spends on gas:
\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:
\[ \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

"To determine the total commission Cayley earns, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
15.00"
"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( M \) represent Marcus's age.
2. Let \( L \) represent Leo's age.
3. Let \( D \) represent Deanna's age, which is given as 26.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
- Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \)

First, substitute the value of \( D \) (26) into the first equation:
\[ M = 26 - 5 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now, substitute \( M = 21 \) into the second equation:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]

To find \( L \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 21 \times 2 = L \]
\[ L = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem statement.

Let \( B \) represent the points scored by Bahati, \( A \) represent the points scored by Azibo, and \( D \) represent the points scored by Dinar.

We are given the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From the second equation, \( A = B - 20 \).
- From the third equation, \( D = B - 10 \).

Next, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides to isolate the term with \( B \):
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find the values of \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to account for the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Calculate the total sleep duration without interruptions:**
   - Kim goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate the time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time she woke up early is 5 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Total time subtracted = Time spent sleepwalking + Time woke up early
   - Total time subtracted = 23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes

5. **Calculate the total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time on the bed = Total sleep duration without interruptions - Total time subtracted
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Given that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen measuring cups, we first convert the number of cups to a numerical value:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so we subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, given the initial conditions and the rate of patient admissions.

1. **Initial Occupied Beds:**
   The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are initially occupied.
   \[
   \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
   \]

2. **Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks:**
   The hospital admits 50 patients each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700
   \]

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the sum of the initial occupied beds and the patients admitted:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900
   \]

4. **Unoccupied Beds:**
   The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity of the hospital minus the total number of occupied beds:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

1. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason: \( D = 2X \)
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey: \( X = 2J \)
3. Jason carried 2 balls: \( X = 2 \)

Using the third equation, we can substitute \( X = 2 \) into the second equation to find \( J \):
\[ X = 2J \]
\[ 2 = 2J \]
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we substitute \( X = 2 \) into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ D = 2X \]
\[ D = 2 \times 2 \]
\[ D = 4 \]

The total number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey is:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem and then solve for the unknowns.

Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe, \( S \) represent the number of Pokémon caught by Stan, and \( X \) represent the number of Pokémon caught by Alex.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13

Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. We will do this by summing the distances traveled south and subtracting the distance traveled north.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of cherries is 60.
2. Robert has 30 cherries.
3. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

From the information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( R + J + C = 60 \)
2. \( R = 30 \)
3. \( R = C + 10 \)

First, substitute \( R = 30 \) into the third equation to find \( C \):

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( E \) be Emil's current age.
- \( D \) be Emil's dad's current age.
- \( B \) be Emil's brother's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
   \[
   E = 19
   \]

2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5)
   \]
   Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \implies 48 = D + 5 \implies D = 43
   \]

3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   \[
   24 = 2 (B + 5)
   \]
   Solving for \( B \):
   \[
   24 = 2 (B + 5) \implies 24 = 2B + 10 \implies 14 = 2B \implies B = 7
   \]

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first calculate the monthly amount she sets aside for shoes. Given that Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes:

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we calculate her annual savings for shoes:

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy in a year is:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the process into two steps: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find the time required to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Rate of peeling}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find the time required to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine the number of batches:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per batch}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Time per batch} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To determine the final temperature change, we need to calculate the cooling and warming effects step by step.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Next, we sum the total cooling and warming effects:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

We know the following:
1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, which is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.
3. The comet appears every 75 years.

Since Bill saw the comet a second time 75 years after he saw it the first time, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 75 = 90 \]

Now, solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 90 - 75 \]
\[ B = 15 \]

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and use ratios to find the number of flights to France.

1. **Total Flights of the First Plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) trips in total.

2. **Flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Flights to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).
   - Since these 22 flights are split equally, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To determine the age of Wilfred, we can use the given information and set up a system of equations based on the ages of the children.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

We are given two key pieces of information:
1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we can write the equation for the total age:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values for Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we can use the principles of ratios and proportions. Given that each adult gets a slice that is twice as large as each kid's slice, we can set up the following relationships:

Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Therefore, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is:
- 4 kids' slices: \( 4x \)
- 2 adults' slices: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

Thus, the total watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the ratio of the size of one adult's slice to the total size of the watermelon:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha, and then find the difference between these quantities.

Let \( p \) represent the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes, and \( m \) represent the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow a step-by-step approach using arithmetic and percentages.

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of babies born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. **Find the total population after a year:**
   The initial population is 50. Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:
   \[
   \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

Thus, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:
\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow a series of geometric and arithmetic calculations. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   Substituting these values into the formula:
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the Volume to Gallons:**
   The pool company provided a conversion factor of 5.9 gallons per cubic foot. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
   \[
   G = V \times 5.9
   \]
   Substituting the volume:
   \[
   G = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Cost to Fill the Pool:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = G \times 0.10
   \]
   Substituting the number of gallons:
   \[
   C = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[
826

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, accounting for the rate of charge loss over time.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge After 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we can break down the problem into a few straightforward steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   Janet works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. The prices are as follows:

- Peaches: $0.50 each
- Pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

Let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

- Cost of peaches: \( 3 \times 0.50 = 1.50 \)
- Cost of pears: \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2.00 \)
- Cost of kiwis: \( 2 \times 1.00 = 2.00 \)
- Cost of apples: \( 5 \times 0.75 = 3.75 \)

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits already purchased:

\[
1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25
\]

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount is:

\[
10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75
\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

\[
0.75 \div 0.25 = 3
\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of sweets Anne had initially. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces she gave away is the total number of pieces minus the pieces she kept:

\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

She distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend received:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the growth factor:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this growth factor to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply the initial price by this growth factor:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

"To determine the total number of portraits and selfies, we start by calculating the number of pictures in each album. Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them equally across 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of selfies. Since 3 albums are dedicated to selfies, the total number of selfies is:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

Similarly, we calculate the total number of portraits. Since 2 albums are dedicated to portraits, the total number of portraits is:

\[ \text{Total number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the two quantities together:

\[ \text{Total number of portraits and selfies} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We are given:
\[ S = 4 \]
\[ L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, given that each dwarf uses a steel pickaxe.

1. **Determine the daily mining rate for one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the mining rate doubles: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the mining rate is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the daily mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total mining rate for 40 dwarves over 30 days:**
   - The daily mining rate for 40 dwarves is 1440 pounds.
   - Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the various scenarios and their respective probabilities. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Probability of a Substitute Teacher:**
   - There is a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
   - Probability: \( P(\text{Substitute}) = 0.50 \)

2. **Probability of the Normal Teacher Giving an Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
   - Probability: \( P(\text{Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.40 \)
   - Combined probability: \( P(\text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20 \)

3. **Probability of Marcus Getting a Personal Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
   - Probability: \( P(\text{No Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.60 \)
   - Probability of getting a personal extension: \( P(\text{Personal Extension} \mid \text{No Extension}) = 0.20 \)
   - Combined probability: \( P(\text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{No Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{Personal Extension} \mid \text{No Extension}) = 0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06 \)

Now, we sum the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: \( 0.50 \)
- Normal teacher gives an extension: \( 0.20 \)
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: \( 0.06 \)

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[ P(\text{No Homework}) = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76 \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
\[ P(\text{Homework}) = 1 - P(\text{No Homework}) = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 0.24 \times 100\% = 24\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of tickets each graduate can distribute to their friends and family. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. We need to account for the seats allocated to graduates and faculty, and then divide the remaining seats equally among the graduates.

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family:
   \[
   \text{Total seats} = 6000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Seats for graduates} = 950
   \]
   \[
   \text{Seats for faculty} = 300
   \]
   \[
   \text{Seats for friends and family} = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750
   \]

2. Divide the number of seats for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give:
   \[
   \text{Number of tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{950} = 5
   \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve the problem, we need to use the relationships between the sizes of the jelly beans and the quantities Grandpa can consume.

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
   \]
3. Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is:
   \[
   150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
   \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains by placing the candy in each bottle. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop the candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we start by calculating the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we find the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we calculate the total area required:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

Given:
- The second person received $80 more than the first person, so the second person received \( x + 80 \).
- The third person received twice what the second person received, so the third person received \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

First, simplify the equation by combining like terms:

\[
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
\]

\[
4x + 240 = 1920
\]

Next, isolate the variable \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides of the equation:

\[
4x = 1680
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[
x = 420
\]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:
   - The cats are fed twice a day.
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total food available = 720 grams.
   - Total food consumed per day = 360 grams/day.
   - Number of days the food will last = 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices, so \( J + 3 = 10 \).

First, solve for \( J \):
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

Now, we know:
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Silvia ate \( 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \) slices.

Next, calculate the total number of slices eaten:
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = J + (J + 3) + 2J \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 7 + 10 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( D \) represent the time in minutes that Donovan took to complete his part of the meal. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets.

We know two things:
1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet:
   \[
   S + H = 100
   \]
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]
Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]
Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[
2S = 40
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
S = 20
\]

Thus, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of periods John has in a week.
2. Determine the total minutes spent in class each week.
3. Calculate the extra learning time for the weekend.
4. Add the extra learning time to the regular class time to get the total weekly learning time.
5. Convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of periods John has in a week.**

John has 6 periods a day plus 2 extra classes, making it 8 periods a day. He goes to class for 5 days a week:
\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total minutes spent in class each week.**

Each class is 40 minutes long:
\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the extra learning time for the weekend.**

John spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on both Saturday and Sunday. First, find 1/16 of the weekly class time:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given, using our expertise in fractions and word problems.

1. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, the remaining meat was 270 kilograms.

2. The pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's denote the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate as \( y \). We have:
   \[
   \frac{y}{2} = 270
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 270 \times 2 = 540
   \]

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is half of the total weight of the triceratops. Let's denote the total weight of the triceratops as \( x \). We have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 540
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 540 \times 2 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

- North and South walls: 10 feet wide by 8 feet high.
- East and West walls: 5 feet wide by 8 feet high.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each pair of walls

**North and South walls:**
- Each wall: \(10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}\)
- Total for both walls: \(2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}\)

**East and West walls:**
- Each wall: \(5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet}\)
- Total for both walls: \(2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}\)

### Step 2: Calculate the total area of all four walls
- Total area: \(160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet}\)

### Step 3: Determine the number of gallons of paint needed
- One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
- Number of gallons needed: \(\frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons}\)

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the paint
- Cost per gallon: $12
- Total cost: \(12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."

"To solve the problem of two trains traveling in opposite directions, we can use the basic formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- The speed of the first train is 60 miles per hour.
- The speed of the second train is half of the first train's speed, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.
- Both trains travel for 3 hours.

First, we calculate the distance each train travels:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \)

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
- Total distance apart: \( 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \)

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we start by understanding the given information: 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. 

First, let's find the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the total population is 240 boys. We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times \text{Total Population} = 240 \]

To solve for the total population, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ \text{Total Population} = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 600 \]

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

\[ \text{Number of Girls} = \text{Total Population} - \text{Number of Boys} \]

\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the total 12 kg to find Jacques's share:
\[
\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"To determine how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. Given that the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can set up a proportion to find the time \( t \) it takes to blink 459 times.

First, we establish the ratio of blinks to time for the given data:
\[ \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{t \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we solve for \( t \) by cross-multiplying and isolating \( t \):
\[ 255 \times t = 459 \times 5 \]
\[ 255t = 2295 \]
\[ t = \frac{2295}{255} \]
\[ t = 9 \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in the same period.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Distance Sofie walks} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

Let \( B \) represent the distance Brian walks in 7 days. Then:
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

"To determine the number of toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total production by the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers each produce 6 toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, each worker produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
   - Therefore, the total production by the first two workers is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) toys.
   - The next two workers each produce 4 toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, each worker produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
   - Therefore, the total production by the next two workers is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) toys.
   - The total production by the first four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

2. **Determine the total number of toys produced by all five workers:**
   - The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys to complete the order.
   - Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all five workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

3. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - The total production by the first four workers is 200 toys.
   - The total production by all five workers is 380 toys.
   - Therefore, the production by the fifth worker is \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

4. **Determine the hourly production of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours.
   - The hourly production of the fifth worker is \(\frac{180}{10} = 18\) toys per hour.

The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, and then sum the weights of all the dogs.

Given:
- Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.
- Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
- Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.

First, we calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we sum the weights of all the dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, which means he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
4. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had a total of \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
5. Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days it will take for Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the Earth.

1. **Determine the half-circumference of the Earth:**
   The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of this distance is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of days required:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day. To find out how many days it will take to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To solve the problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. We know that Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
14 = 2V
\]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[
V + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9
\]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the given information and solve for the unknowns.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- \( M \) as the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- \( C \) as the number of eggs Camden painted.
- \( S \) as the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).
4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56: \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).

First, substitute \( A = M \) into the total equation:
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \]

Next, substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into \( C = S + 12 \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

Next, substitute \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \) into the total equation \( 2A + C + S = 56 \):
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Since \( A = M \), Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we will break it down into a series of arithmetic steps and unit conversions. Let's start by determining the number of groups of crayons and the number of boxes needed.

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking 3 miles, given her different walking speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total amount Jane has already saved. Given that she saves $4 each week and has been saving for 8 weeks, the total amount saved so far is:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. This can be calculated as:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since Jane continues to save $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve the problem, we start by translating the given information into an algebraic equation. We are told that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

where \( x \) represents the number of marbles Bob currently has. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by isolating \( x \):

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. We subtract 10 from the current number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we can use the principle of weighted averages. Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T_2 \).

Given:
- The temperature of the water in the first mug, \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees.
- The volume of water from the first mug, \( V_1 = 4 \) ounces.
- The volume of water from the second mug, \( V_2 = 1 \) ounce.
- The final temperature of the mixed water, \( T_f \), must be at least 40 degrees.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{V_1 \cdot T_1 + V_2 \cdot T_2}{V_1 + V_2} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We need \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount on $40.00 is calculated as follows:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to determine the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be expressed algebraically as:

\[ \text{Scoops Gomer ate} = 23 - 5 = 18 \]

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be broken down as follows:

\[ \text{Potatoes needed for 2 scoops} = 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ \text{Scoops made from 3 potatoes} = 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, 3 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\).

2. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - Over the next 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\).

3. Add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days:
   - Total eggs = \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\).

4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of dozens is \(\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}\).

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar. We know the following:

1. There are 17 green jellybeans.
2. There are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans.
3. The total number of jellybeans is 60.

First, let's calculate the number of red jellybeans:
\[
\text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times \text{Number of green jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
\]

\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = \text{Total number of jellybeans} - (\text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans})
\]
\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then find the joint probability of both events occurring.

1. The probability that the first lottery ticket wins is given as 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket wins is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. The joint probability that both tickets win is the product of their individual probabilities:
   \[
   0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
2. Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
3. Let \( R \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Jim collected 27 seashells: \( J = 27 \)
- Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos: \( J = C + 5 \)
- Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey: \( C = 2R \)

First, substitute \( J = 27 \) into the second equation:
\[ 27 = C + 5 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 27 - 5 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

Next, substitute \( C = 22 \) into the third equation:
\[ 22 = 2R \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ R = 11 \]

Now, we have the number of seashells each person collected:
- Jim: \( J = 27 \)
- Carlos: \( C = 22 \)
- Carrey: \( R = 11 \)

The total number of seashells collected is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells.

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

First, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the lengths of the ropes and then solve for the unknowns.

Let \( B \) represent the length of the blue rope in centimeters. According to the problem:
- The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Next, we isolate \( B \) by subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the initial amounts of money that Ronnie and Rissa have. Let \( R \) represent the amount of money Ronnie has, and \( S \) represent the amount of money Rissa has. According to the problem:

\[ R = 5 \]
\[ S = 3R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gives to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. The problem states that Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ R - x = 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we start by noting that the mural is composed of four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. The problem states that half of the mural is yellow, and the remaining half is equally divided among the red, white, and purple paints.

1. First, calculate the amount of yellow paint used:
   \[
   \text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

2. Next, determine the total amount of paint used for the red, white, and purple colors:
   \[
   \text{Total paint for red, white, and purple} = 12 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, we divide the remaining paint equally among these three colors:
   \[
   \text{Red paint} = \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we can use the concept of geometric progression, where each term is double the previous term.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

The sequence of the number of puffs counted each day is: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48.

To find the total number of puffs counted over the five days, we sum these terms:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]
where \(a\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the number of terms.

Here, \(a = 3\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 5\):
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{2^5 - 1}{2 - 1} \]
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{32 - 1}{1} \]
\[ S_5 = 3 \times 31 \]
\[ S_5 = 93 \]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

"To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach, applying basic arithmetic operations and conversions.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves and then sum them up.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

"To solve the problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem statement.

Let \( W \) represent Wendy's current age and \( C \) represent Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we will expand and simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Bob can purchase with $27,000, given that 100 books cost $500, and then divide that total by the number of schools, which is 3.

First, let's find the cost per book:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[ \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the sequence of events and calculate the total number of apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first event) + 5 (from the second event) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (left from the previous step) + 6 (from the third event) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton has in his pocket:

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is \(4 \times 6 = 24\) slices.

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3\) pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- The number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3\) pizzas.

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:

"To solve the problem, we can use algebra to set up and solve the equations based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( J \) as Jim's age 20 years ago.
- \( J + 20 \) as Jim's current age.
- \( 28 \) as John's current age.
- \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) as John's age 20 years ago.

According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. This can be expressed as:
\[ 8 = 2J \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago:

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backwards from the final count.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then sum them up.

1. **Red Pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
     \[
     5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
     \]

2. **Black Pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought twice the number of packs of black pens as red pens.
   - Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
     \[
     2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
     \]
   - Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
     \[
     10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
     \]

3. **Total Number of Pens:**
   - The total number of pens is the sum of the red pens and the black pens:
     \[
     25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}
     \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps, focusing on the arithmetic and percentages involved.

1. **Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
   - Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10 = $60

2. **Determine the number of bottles of cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch
   - Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10 = 20

3. **Calculate the cost per bottle of cognac:**
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + 50% of Cost per bottle of scotch
   - Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + 0.5 * $60 = $60 + $30 = $90

4. **Calculate the total cost of the cognac:**
   - Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac
   - Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90 = $1800

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on everything:**
   - Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
   - Total amount spent = $600 + $1800 = $2400

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is:

"To solve the problem, we start by translating the given statement into an algebraic equation. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40"" can be written as:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Here, \( x \) represents the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge. To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by first subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we can break down the problem into a series of arithmetic steps:

1. **Initial Count of Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy has two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy also has three makeup sets, each with 6 colors:
     \[
     3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has is:
     \[
     8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **Colors Stolen by Her Sister:**
   - Her sister steals one of the palettes, which contains 4 colors:

"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call with the given pricing structure, we can break the call into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - The price per minute for the first 16 minutes is $0.25.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
     \[
     16 \times 0.25 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost for the remaining 20 minutes:**
   - After 16 minutes, the price per minute drops to $0.20.
   - Therefore, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost for the 36-minute call:**
   - Adding the costs of both segments, we get:
     \[
     4.00 + 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost of a 36-minute call is \( 8.00 \) dollars.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) represent the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats is:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]

We can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Simplify and solve for \( c \):
\[
c + 3c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c = 12
\]
\[
c = 3
\]

Thus, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

     \]

2. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - The discount amount is 20% of $75:
     \[
     75 \times 0.20 = 15
     \]
   - The total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     75 - 15 = 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the nail art:**
   - Karen wants nail art on each of her 10 fingers.

"To solve the problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of paintings each person has.

Let:
- \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has,
- \( S \) represent the number of paintings Shelley has,
- \( M \) represent the number of paintings Samantha has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings: \( M = 27 \).

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Solving for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To determine the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - Therefore, the price in December is $72.

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, the price in January is $36.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, given that 9 novels represent 3 quarters of that total.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

To isolate the number of novels this year, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Given that a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and knowing that 1 dozen equals 12 seeds, we can calculate the total number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower, which has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower gives us the total number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a series of algebraic equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J \) represent Jackie's height before the summer.
2. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her current height is \( J + 3 \).
3. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   J + 3 = A - 2
   \]
   where \( A \) is Anne's height.
4. Anne is twice the height of Albert, and Albert's height is 36 inches, so:
   \[
   A = 2 \times 36 = 72
   \]
5. Substitute \( A = 72 \) into the equation \( J + 3 = A - 2 \):
   \[
   J + 3 = 72 - 2
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   J + 3 = 70
   \]
6. Solve for \( J \) by subtracting 3 from both sides:
   \[
   J = 70 - 3
   \]
   \[
   J = 67
   \]

Therefore, Jackie's height before the summer was 67 inches.

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day, so:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he fills in 9 holes per day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

To find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To determine how many beakers Igor lost, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Igor gathered the correct number of beakers but lost some, so he placed \( 7 - x \) beakers on the lab bench.

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is given as 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the relationships between the distances and speeds of Aaron and Vanessa. Let's denote the speed of Vanessa as \( v \) miles per minute. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

Given:
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron ran 2 miles (since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron).
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we calculate Aaron's speed:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since Aaron's speed is \( 2v \):
\[ 2v = \frac{1}{8} \]
\[ v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we calculate the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

   - Therefore, \( D + 3 = 12 \).
   - Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = 12 - 3 = 9 \).

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Let \( J \) be James's current age.
   - Therefore, \( J = 2D \).
   - Substituting \( D = 9 \), we get \( J = 2 \times 9 = 18 \).

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Let \( J_{\text{John}} \) be John's current age.
   - Therefore, \( J_{\text{John}} = 19 + J \).
   - Substituting \( J = 18 \), we get \( J_{\text{John}} = 19 + 18 = 37 \).

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Let \( Y \) be the current age of John's youngest son.
   - Therefore, \( Y = J_{\text{John}} - 32 \).
   - Substituting \( J_{\text{John}} = 37 \), we get \( Y = 37 - 32 = 5 \).

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \( Y + 3 \).
   - Substituting \( Y = 5 \), we get \( Y + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8 \).

The final answer is:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in 60 minutes and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the total cost Mark paid for the new radiator and its installation, we need to break down the expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of the Radiator:**
   - Original price of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of Mechanic's Labor:**
   - Mechanic's hourly rate: $50
   - Hours of work: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of labor
   - Total cost: \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

230"
"To solve the problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To determine how many slices each person can have, we start by calculating the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Each pizza is divided into 8 slices:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. There are 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends):

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.
