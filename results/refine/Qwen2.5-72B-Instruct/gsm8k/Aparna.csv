"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original value.
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = New value of the house - Total investment
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

He then turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. During this return trip, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance he covers on his return trip is:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"As a data scientist with a strong background in mathematical problem-solving, I can help you determine the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Daily Egg Consumption**: Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. **Number of Days in 4 Weeks**: There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) days.
3. **Total Eggs Consumed in 4 Weeks**: Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs} \).
4. **Convert Eggs to Dozens**: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12: \( \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She has already walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another hour. This means she has covered 6 miles in 2 hours.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we need to determine the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, let's break down the information provided:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \) (total number of coins)
2. \( G = S + 30 \) (30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know \( S = 40 \), we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To calculate the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
2. Calculate the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Compute the total cost for the yogurts consumed over 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Over 30 days, he will consume:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. Therefore, the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Step 3: Total cost for 60 yogurts
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ 75.00 \]

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

Let's calculate the total time he spends running each week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time spent running per week:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate his average speed using the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she holds the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the dragon's flame reach:**
   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.

3. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the throwing distance with the gemstone:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When tomatoes are cooked into sauce, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce:
     \[
     \text{Initial volume} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.
   - To find out how many cans were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes:
     \[
     \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     \text{Total tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"As an avid gardener, I understand the joy of nurturing and sharing plants. Let's calculate how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away.

Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. This gives us:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

She received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery, so the total number of potted plants she now has is:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can break down the total TV watching time over the week and isolate Wednesday's viewing.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Summing up the time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Given that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she initially bought and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:

Given:
- Each pepper costs $15.
- A watermelon costs three times the cost of a pepper.
- An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon.
- Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

First, let's determine the cost of each item:
1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:
1. **Total cost for 4 watermelons:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Total cost for 20 peppers:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost for 10 oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, let's sum up the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
\[
\text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[
\boxed{880}

"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Total Time Spent on Patients:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Total Revenue from Patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Total Cost to the Hospital:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

5. **Calculate the Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of elves, which is 60. A third of these elves quit after children vomit on them. We calculate the number of elves who quit as follows:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, 20 elves quit, leaving:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, 10 of the remaining 40 elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves left is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of elves left is 30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Miles walked on Monday:**
   - Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.

2. **Miles walked on Tuesday:**
   - Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, he walked \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

3. **Total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

4. **Miles walked on Wednesday:**
   - To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total mileage.
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday: \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.
   - Therefore, the miles walked on Wednesday: \( 41 - 28 = 13 \) miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. Given that there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is given as 700. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):

\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):

\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):

\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):

\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the water depth on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, the water depth is 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the water depth increases by 7 feet.
   - Therefore, the water depth on Tuesday is:
     \[
     17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the water depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the water depth on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:

"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to sum up the quantities of each type of fish they caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of fish caught by both:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum up the total number of fish:

\[
15 \text{ (starfish)} + 9 \text{ (sea horses)} + 8 \text{ (clownfish)} = 32 \text{ fish}

"To solve the problem of determining the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the concept of compound interest, which is a common method in financial mathematics for calculating growth over time.

1. **Initial Price and Increase Rate:**
   - Initial price of the bag of marbles: $20
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Number of Increases:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases over 36 months is:
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
     \]

3. **Multiplier for Each Increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, so the multiplier for each increase is:
     \[
     1 + 0.20 = 1.20
     \]

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore, the final price is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
     \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let's denote:
- Seth's current age as \( S \)
- Brooke's current age as \( B \)

From the first piece of information, we have:
\[ S = 2B \]

From the second piece of information, we know that in 2 years:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

### Step 1: Calculate the Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Relative Likelihood
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This can be calculated as the ratio of the two probabilities:

\[
\text{Relative likelihood} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

### Final Answer:

2. **Cost of the food:**
   - They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
   - Therefore, the cost of the food is:
     \[
     20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
     \]

3. **Cost of the rides:**
   - They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the rides is:
     \[
     33 \times 2 = 66
     \]

4. **Total cost:**
   - Adding up all the costs:
     \[
     20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102
     \]

5. **Cost per person:**
   - Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each person pays:

"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement and then convert it to a daily amount.

1. Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
   \[
   3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

2. To find the daily requirement, we divide the total weekly requirement by 7 days:
   \[
   35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual Changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of Trees After 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees That Die After 10 Years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final Number of Trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Thus, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on Sue's front yard.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool, and \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

From the problem, we know:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[ B = 4S \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to break down the information given and perform some calculations.

1. **Naomi's Score**: It is given that Naomi scored 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score. 
   - Half of Naomi's score: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
   - Yuri's score: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)
3. **Brianna's Score**: Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi.
   - Brianna's score: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Next, we sum the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards initially. After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the new counts are:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Calculating the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many times Anne went down the slide:**
   - Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
   - Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.
   - 30% of 30 is calculated as:
     \[
     30 \times 0.30 = 9
     \]
   - Therefore, Anne went down the slide:
     \[
     30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times}
     \]

2. **Determine how many times Robert went down the slide:**
   - Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.
   - So, Robert went down the slide:
     \[
     21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ times}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cows:**
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Total initial number of cows: \( 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \).

2. **Cows Added:**
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among 20 stalls.
   - Number of new cows per stall: \( \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \).

3. **Total Number of Cows per Stall After Addition:**
   - Each stall now has \( 20 \text{ original cows} + 2 \text{ new cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \).

4. **Number of Cows in 8 Stalls:**
   - To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls: \( 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \).

Thus, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the redwood tree. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
- Andrea has 52 apples.

Let's denote:
- \( J_a \) as the number of apples Jamal has.
- \( J_b \) as the number of bananas Jamal has.
- \( A_a \) as the number of apples Andrea has.
- \( A_b \) as the number of bananas Andrea has.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we can find \( J_a \) using the fourth equation:
\[ A_a = 52 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we can find \( J_b \) using the third equation:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find \( A_b \) using the second equation:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:

- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's sum the total number of stories for each person over the two weeks:

- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories

Finally, we add the totals for all three:

\[ 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 \]

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. To find out how much money she has in total, we need to convert the quarters and dimes into cents and then sum them up.

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.

Adding these together, Kelly has \(125 + 20 = 145\) cents in total.

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is:
\[145 - 55 = 90\] cents.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Thus, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the car in the slow lane:**
   - The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
   - The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed.
   - Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles:**
   - We use the formula for time, which is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - The distance to be covered is 480 miles, and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the time taken is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
     \]

The time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total working time and then apply her earning rate.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
2. She takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.
3. Convert the working time into minutes: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.
4. Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10: 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.
5. Multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval: 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members who each consume 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly consumption:**

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Total number of players on the football team: 105
- Number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense.
- Number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense.

Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

From the problem:
- Number of players on the offense: \( 2D \)
- Number of players on the special teams: \( \frac{D}{2} \)

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 30
   \]

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are \(\frac{1}{10}\) as many nongendered children as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required.

The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of electric poles. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

So, the total number of electric poles required is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

"To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots required and then subtract this from the number of plant pots she initially bought.

1. The school requested 30 plant pots for the daisies.
2. They also requested twice as many plant pots for the roses, which means:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ plant pots for the roses}
   \]
3. The total number of plant pots needed is:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ plant pots}
   \]
4. April had already bought 100 plant pots. Therefore, the number of plant pots she has left over is:
   \[
   100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots}
   \]

So, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the activities and the time John spent on each:

1. **Boating**: 6 hours
2. **Swimming**: Half the time spent boating, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
3. **Watching shows**: 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Adding these times together gives the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

According to the problem, these 15 hours represent 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save for the phone, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her current savings.

From her first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

From her second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours:
\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding these earnings to her current savings of $80:
\[ 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:
\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10%, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167

"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can use the information that he has 12.8 hectares left after selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land. This means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land remaining.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation representing the remaining land is:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls in the choir:**
   - The choir has 52 members.
   - 50% of the members are boys, and 50% are girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
   - Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

2. **Determine the number of girls who can make it to the performance:**
   - The performance is with just the female members.
   - On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down.
   - Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

3. **Include the teachers who decide to sing:**
   - The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls.
   - Total number of people who sang in the performance = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to determine how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the number of popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To ensure everyone is well-fed during the big game, Tyson needs to make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people. Each sandwich serves 4 people, so he will need to make:

\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, he will need:

\[ \text{Total meat needed} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese needed} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of the meat and cheese is as follows:
- Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
- Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.

So, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:

\[ \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can use the following calculation:

- Total steps goal: 10,000
- Steps taken to and from school: 5,000
- Steps taken with his friend: 1,000
- Steps left after the jog: 2,000

First, we calculate the total steps taken before the jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with his friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Next, we know that after the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. Therefore, the total steps taken before and during the jog is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ (total goal)} - 2,000 \text{ (steps left)} = 8,000 \text{ steps} \]

To find the steps taken during the jog, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before and during the jog:
\[ 8,000 \text{ (total before and during jog)} - 6,000 \text{ (before jog)} = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

"Sally went to the seashore for vacation and her parents gave her $10 to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She bought 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50, and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. Let's calculate how much money she has left.

First, let's determine the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
- The total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, the cost of the mixed bag of seashells is $1.50.

The cost of the 4 magnets is:
- Each magnet costs $0.25.
- The total cost for 4 magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00
- Total cost: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
- $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To ensure Shannon has enough madeleine cookies to last her 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will consume and then convert that into dozens, since her recipe makes cookies by the dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we convert the total number of cookies into dozens:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \div 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of candles that both explode and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

1. First, we determine the number of candles that are expected to explode. Given that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, the probability of a candle exploding is 1% (or 0.01).

   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the exploding candles have this defect.

   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, let's use a system of linear equations. We are given that the total number of heads is 180 and the total number of humps is 304. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of heads:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]

2. The total number of humps:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

To find the number of dromedaries, we can solve this system of equations. First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):

\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:

\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):

\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):

\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made a total of $150 from selling his Pokémon cards.

Each card is sold for $1.5. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is given by:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 \]

We know this amount is $150:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

To find \( C \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. This means 18 guests (half of 36) would get 2 hot dogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hot dog each.
   - The total number of hot dogs prepared is:
     \[
     18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is:
     \[
     80 - 54 = 26 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{1} = 26 \text{ guests}
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. The area of the room is given as 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = \(1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60\) beads.

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Margareth bought = \(3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140\) beads.

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
- Difference = Total beads Margareth bought - Total beads Elizabeth bought = \(140 - 60 = 80\) beads.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"When Marcus wakes up, the house is at 40 degrees. Over the course of 3 hours of baking, the temperature in the house increases by 5 degrees each hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase due to baking is:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

So, the temperature after baking is:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down at a rate of 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. The total cooling over 30 minutes is:

30 minutes / 10 minutes * 2 degrees = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting the cooling from the temperature after baking gives us the final temperature:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes.
   - Convert 30 minutes to hours: \( 30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Determine the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   - The horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) bail of hay per mile.
   - Hay needed = \( 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Total cost = \( 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Determine the total amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six 5-dollar bills.
   - Total money = \( 6 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bill} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

5. **Calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:**
   - Change = Total money - Total cost = \( 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - You get one popcorn and one soda for an additional $1.
   - Total cost with the super ticket: \( 20 + 1 = 21 \) dollars.

2. **Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let the regular price of the popcorn be \( P \) dollars.
   - Total cost without the super ticket: \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \) dollars.

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - This gives us the equation: \( 15 + P = 21 - 2 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pencils:**
   - There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total initial pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.
   - Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

3. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We need to determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, given that he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the equation:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that this combined length represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are two remoras, the combined length is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Lily, David, and Bodhi together collected 43 insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found.
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found.
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma. We start by adding the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that fraction into yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4.

Convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To help Andy reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, we need to calculate the daily calorie deficit he should aim for. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Determine the total number of days:**
   - From December 31st to July 19th:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days

   Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the cost of the computer:**
   - The computer costs $1,100.

2. **Determine the cost of the printer:**
   - The printer costs $400 less than the computer.
   - Therefore, the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:**
   - Total cost of the computer and printer = $1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) = $1,800.

4. **Find the total cost of the 2 monitors:**
   - The total amount spent is $2,400.
   - Subtract the total cost of the computer and printer from the total amount spent: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

5. **Determine the cost of one monitor:**
   - The total cost of the 2 monitors is $600.
   - Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

The cost of one monitor is $300.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, which is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

"To determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made in the first three weeks:
   - First week: 18 vlogs
   - Second week: 21 vlogs
   - Third week: 15 vlogs

   Total vlogs made so far: \( 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \) vlogs

2. Subtract the total number of vlogs made from her monthly goal:
   - Monthly goal: 72 vlogs
   - Vlogs made so far: 54 vlogs

   Vlogs needed: \( 72 - 54 = 18 \) vlogs

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To calculate the total amount you need to pay, we first determine the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Adding this tip to the original bill gives us the total amount:

$50 + $10 = $60

Since the bill is split evenly, each person would normally pay half of the original bill:

$50 / 2 = $25

However, since you are responsible for the entire tip, you need to add the full tip amount to your half of the bill:

$25 (your half of the bill) + $10 (the tip) = $35

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

3. **Spending**:
   - The eldest boy spends $8 from his total:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount**:
   - After spending, he triples the amount he has left:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)

4. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \).
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"As an engineering student, Daniel needs to purchase specific school supplies for his studies. Let's calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy, taking into account the 10% discount offered by the shop.

First, we'll calculate the cost of each type of item:
- Notebooks: 5 notebooks at $1.50 each = 5 * 1.50 = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens at $0.25 each = 2 * 0.25 = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator at $12.00 each = 1 * 12.00 = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set at $10.00 each = 1 * 10.00 = $10.00

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop offers a 10% discount on all items. To find the discount amount:
Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * 30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to pay:
Final cost = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks, we need to break down the information given and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert this reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.

- Therefore, the number of pages read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

Let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

"Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. When he increases the weight by 50%, the calculation is as follows:

50% of 8 pounds = 0.50 * 8 = 4 pounds

Adding this to the original weight:

8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Since 12 pounds is too heavy, he decides to use a weight that is 2 pounds lighter:

12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"To calculate the total number of video games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into the initial number of games, the games he buys each month, and the games he receives for Christmas each year.

1. **Initial Games:**
   - Steve starts with 5 games from his birthday.

2. **Games Purchased:**
   - In the first year, he buys 1 game per month for 12 months: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
   - In the second year, he buys 2 games per month for 12 months: \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
   - In the third year, he buys 4 games per month for 12 months: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.

3. **Games Received for Christmas:**
   - He receives 5 games each Christmas for 3 years: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, we sum up all the games:
- Initial games: 5
- Games purchased in the first year: 12
- Games purchased in the second year: 24
- Games purchased in the third year: 48
- Games received for Christmas: 15

Total games: \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is the distance divided by the speed, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the rate at which Ruiz makes chocolates. Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, the rate at which Ruiz makes chocolates is:

\[ \text{Rate of Ruiz} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's rate is:

\[ \text{Rate of Marissa} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ \text{Total for Ruiz} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ \text{Total for Marissa} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ \text{Total amount of chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two segments and calculate the earnings for each segment separately.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- The total number of cups sold in the first four hours is \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the first four hours are \( 60 \text{ cups} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- The total number of cups sold in the next two hours is \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the next two hours are \( 20 \text{ cups} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both segments:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we first need to understand the total number of washes the bottle can provide under her usage.

Given:
- The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
- The directions suggest using 2 pumps per wash, which provides 120 washes.

If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes the bottle can provide is:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we calculate the cost per pump:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\text{Total cost of the bottle}}{\text{Total number of pumps}} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents:
\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- The shirt costs $25.
- The shorts cost $35.
- Total cost before discount: \( 25 + 35 = 60 \) dollars.

Next, we apply the 30% discount:
- A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost.
- Discounted total: \( 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money:
- Joe has $50.
- Amount left after purchase: \( 50 - 42 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, Joe will have \(\boxed{8}\) dollars left after the purchase."

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Monthly funding for the first 5 months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: $20,000 * 5 = $100,000

2. **Extended period:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for the additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for initial 5 months + Cost for additional 45 months

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the truck over the week, we can break down the week into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the truck towed 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the truck towed 4 fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. So, the number of cars towed each day for the last four days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the totals from both parts of the week gives us the total number of cars towed:

First, we calculate the number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. We calculate the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ 10 \]"
"As a jeweler with extensive knowledge in the field, I can help you calculate the total price for the three jewels based on the given information.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond Jewell is given as $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. 

The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 total classes. If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate the number of customers each processes daily and then extend that to a weekly total.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

The total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

"To solve this, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the more expensive coffee:**
   - The normal brand costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
   - 20% of $5 is \( 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the more expensive brand costs \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) dollars per pound.

2. **Total coffee cost for a week:**
   - Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs \( 7 \times 1 = 7 \) pounds.
   - The total cost for the coffee is \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of the donut:**
   - The donut costs $2.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut: \( 42 + 2 = 44 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

"James needs to ensure that each dog at his shelter has one toy. Initially, he has 4 toys for 4 dogs. When 8 more dogs join, he needs to buy 8 more toys to have a total of 12 toys for 12 dogs. However, upon his return, he finds that the number of dogs has doubled to 24. This means he needs to buy an additional 12 toys to have a total of 24 toys for 24 dogs. When he comes back again, he finds that 3 dogs have left the shelter, reducing the number of dogs to 21. Therefore, he no longer needs 3 toys, so he needs to buy 9 more toys to have a total of 21 toys for 21 dogs.

To summarize:
- Initial toys: 4
- Toys bought for 8 more dogs: 8
- Toys bought for 12 more dogs (due to doubling): 12
- Toys no longer needed (3 dogs left): -3

Total toys needed: 4 + 8 + 12 - 3 = 21

"Let's solve this step-by-step using algebra to find the total number of cookies.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]
3. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]
4. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61

5. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Next, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get for the function, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Each adult will need a regular chair.
   - Each baby will need a high chair.

   Total chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of babies
   \[
   42 + 15 = 57
   \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
   \]

   Total chairs currently available = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
   \[
   8 + 40 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Total chairs needed = 57
   - Total chairs currently available = 48

   Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs currently available
   \[
   57 - 48 = 9
   \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. The ice cream parlor is offering a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00.

First, let's determine how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 2 paid scoops gives her 1 free scoop, so:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Number of Pizzas and Slices:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - Total number of pizzas = 5.
   - Total number of slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices Eaten by Bryce and Two Friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices Eaten by the Remaining Two Friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices Left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cat's Eating Time:**
   - The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.

2. **Dog's Eating Time:**
   - The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes.
   - Therefore, the dog's time is:
     \[
     \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Average Time Calculation:**
   - The average time is the sum of the cat's time and the dog's time divided by 2.
   - So, the average time is:
     \[
     \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches and then use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe.

First, convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we have:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the relationship given in the problem. The length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of votes for candidate A:**
   - Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for candidate A = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. **Determine the number of votes for candidate B:**
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% more than 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for candidate B = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. **Determine the number of votes for candidate C:**
   - The total number of votes is 100.

   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

4. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Number of large stickers left: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she trades the remaining 20 large stickers for:
     \[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

5. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Small buttons from trading remaining large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \)

6. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons, so the 20 large buttons are equivalent to:
     \[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]
   - Total small buttons (including the equivalent of large buttons):
     \[ 87 + 60 = 147 \]

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

\[ 147 \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is equal to the total number of people on the council:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting \( F = 2A \) into the equation \( F + A = 33 \):

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"To determine the total number of field trip shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the requirements step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
2. The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it also needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using my expertise in algebra and logical reasoning.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can harvest from his garden, we need to calculate the yield from both the tomato and eggplant plants separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has planted 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has planted 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is 142.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the number of students on campus. Given that the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

\[ N(t) = N_0 \times 2^t \]

where:
- \( N(t) \) is the number of students at time \( t \) (in months),
- \( N_0 \) is the initial number of students,
- \( t \) is the time in months.

Given:
- \( N_0 = 10 \) (initial number of students),
- \( t = 5 \) (end of May, which is 5 months from the beginning of the year).

Let's calculate the number of students at the end of May:

\[ N(5) = 10 \times 2^5 \]
\[ N(5) = 10 \times 32 \]
\[ N(5) = 320 \]

So, there are 320 students on campus at the end of May.

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[ \text{Additional students} = N(5) - N_0 \]
\[ \text{Additional students} = 320 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Additional students} = 310 \]

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the components and their relationships:

- Let the amount of citrus zest be \( z \) ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total volume:

\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):

\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:

\[ \text{Amount of oil} = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

"To determine how much each student raised, we first need to calculate the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Since there are 20 students, and they each raised the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day Walking Time:**
   Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

2. **Second Day Walking Time:**
   On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Total Walking Time in Hours:**
   To find the total time Sandy walked over the two days, we add the hours from both days:

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- The total number of Magic Cards is 341.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

Since Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be found using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - For 3 kangaroos:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     \text{Total speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{Total speed of 4 turtles}} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}

2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so the number of socks Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so the number of dishes Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Total number of socks:
  \[
  \text{Total socks} = 30 + 60 = 90
  \]
- Total number of dishes:
  \[
  \text{Total dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90
  \]

Finally, the total number of socks and dishes together is:
\[
\text{Total} = 90 + 90 = 180

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- Students good at math only: 5
- Total students: 20
- Students good at English only: 8

First, we find the number of students who are good at both math and English by subtracting the students good at English only and those good at math only from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 8 - 5 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Next, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects to get the total number of students good at math:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform at the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including the time for getting on stage, performing, and exiting the stage. We also need to account for the intermission.

Each group's total time:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtract the 10-minute intermission:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time each group takes:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To solve the problem of calculating the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the principal (P):**
   The principal amount \( P \) is $300.

2. **Determine the interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. Therefore, the interest rate \( r \) is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

3. **Identify the time (t):**
   The time period \( t \) is 3 years.

4. **Calculate the simple interest (I):**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   I = 300 \times 675
   \]
   \[
   I = 202500
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount (A):**
   The total amount \( A \) is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   A = 300 + 202500
   \]
   \[
   A = 202800

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- I am three years younger than my brother.
- I am two years older than my sister.
- My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
- The sum of all our ages is 87.

Let's denote:
- My age as \( x \).
- My brother's age as \( x + 3 \).
- My sister's age as \( x - 2 \).
- My mom's age as \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The equation for the sum of our ages is:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To ensure each of the 27 students in Mr. Jackson’s fourth-grade class gets 2 glue sticks, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to determine how many packs are required to meet or exceed 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks:

\[ \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, let's start by calculating the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Given that each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate this as:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the desired profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, let's calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he bought is:
\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale is:
\[ 7000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more glasses of lemonade Julie sold compared to Micah. 

First, we know the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, each of them sold:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Thus, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the rope:**
   - Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.
   - Her friend buys it for $2 per meter.
   - Total revenue = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.

2. **Calculate the cost of the new rope:**
   - The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
   - Sarah wants to buy 20 meters of the new rope.
   - Total cost = 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30.

3. **Determine the leftover money:**
   - Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total revenue.
   - Leftover money = $40 - $30 = $10.

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Kelly is grocery shopping and needs to ensure she stays within her budget. Let's break down the costs of the items she has:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs at a total cost of $10, so each pack costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   With 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
   With 7 packs, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To calculate the total amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we need to determine the material required for each type of mask and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let \( y \) represent the number of yellow balloons. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 3 \times y \]

According to the problem, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first determine the total distance driven in a 30-day month. Given that Jon drives 100 miles each day, the total distance driven in 30 days is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since the car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by the interval for tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, let's break down the hours worked each day:

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: He works twice the time he worked on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: He works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is:

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the profit the class raised from selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, then find the difference between them.

1. **Total Number of Lollipops Sold:**
   Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   \[
   \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Total Revenue:**
   Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( L \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the given information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we need to calculate the hay required for the goats and the sheep separately and then sum these amounts.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

\[ \text{Labor Cost} = 2.25 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 78.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 \text{ dollars} + 78.75 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 178.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Patty charged is:
\[ 178.75 \]

"James gets 10 new CDs, each costing $15. With a 40% discount, the cost per CD is reduced to 60% of the original price. Let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

\[ \text{Discounted price per CD} = 15 \times 0.60 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 10 CDs} = 10 \times 9 = 90 \]

James then sells 5 of the CDs for $40. To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the amount he recovered from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money out} = 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of crop by its respective selling price and then sum the totals.

1. For the yams:
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam sells for $1.50.
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 * $1.50 = $9.00.

2. For the sweet potatoes:
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato sells for $2.00.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 * $2.00 = $20.00.

3. For the carrots:
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot sells for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 * $1.25 = $5.00.

Adding these amounts together gives us Jen's total earnings:
- Total earnings = $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00.

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells all her root crops.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Swimming Distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Time for Initial Swimming:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Rest Time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Remaining Distance:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Speed for Remaining Distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Time for Remaining Swimming:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns from selling newspapers, we need to consider the commission rate for each type of newspaper and the number of copies sold.

1. **New York Times:**
   - Commission rate: 10%
   - Cost per copy: $5
   - Number of copies sold: 6
   - Commission per copy: \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars
   - Total commission from New York Times: \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Commission rate: 8%
   - Cost per copy: $15
   - Number of copies sold: 10
   - Commission per copy: \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal: \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- The total points scored by the team is 45.
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the points scored by Bahati,
- \( A \) as the points scored by Azibo,
- \( D \) as the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using algebra to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught.

Given:
1. Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.
- \( X \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. Let's break down the journey step by step:

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first, and then see how much soil is left for the roses.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Peeling Time:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking Time:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine the number of batches:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per batch}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) flights in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The number of remaining flights is \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We have a family of 6 people, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon is to be divided such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Total cost per week: $40 * 3 = $120

Then, calculate the total cost per month:
- Total cost per week: $120
- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total cost per month: $120 * 4 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings (or rather, the total expenses) of the dance studio in a month are:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. **Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population:**
   The initial population is 50. Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:
   \[
   \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

Thus, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:
\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company provided a conversion factor of 5.9 gallons per cubic foot. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
   \[
   G = V \times 5.9
   \]
   \[
   G = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Thus, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = G \times 0.10
   \]
   \[
   C = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]"

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, considering the rate at which the power bank lost charge over time.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge After 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, let's first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Adding these amounts together gives the total spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the growth factor:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this growth factor to the power of 3:

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their respective probabilities. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set.
- Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

Let \( x \) be the number of balls retrieved in the second set.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
- First set: \( x + 4 \)
- Second set: \( x \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} \)

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the times taken by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the earnings from selling apples, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

1. First, we find the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold 2000 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining weight after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total production by the first four workers:**
   - Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - Each worker works for 10 hours.

   For the first two workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
   \]

   For the next two workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
   \]

   Total production by the first four workers:
   \[
   120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of toys produced by all five workers:**
   - The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys.
   - Therefore, the number of toys produced by the end of the shift:
   \[
   400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Total production by all five workers: 380 toys.
   - Total production by the first four workers: 200 toys.
   - Production by the fifth worker:
   \[
   380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
   \]

4. **Determine the hourly production of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours.
   - Hourly production of the fifth worker:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
   \]

The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, and then sum up all the weights.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days it will take for Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the Earth.

1. The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers.
2. Half of the Earth's circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]
3. Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

5. **Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

6. **Total Eggs Painted by All Four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
   - Therefore, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).

7. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - \( 2A = 26 \)
   - \( A = 13 \)

8. **Number of Eggs Camden Painted More Than Arnold:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to group them into sets of 8.
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes required is equal to the number of groups.
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we first calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem provides a ratio: it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's calculate these values:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to calculate the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then find the combined probability.

1. The probability that the first lottery ticket wins is 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket wins is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. The probability that both tickets win is the product of their individual probabilities:
   \[
   0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   0.12 \times 100 = 12\%

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of seashells each person collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\) seashells.

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells:**
   - Total seashells = Seashells collected by Jim + Seashells collected by Carlos + Seashells collected by Carrey
   - Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

3. **Divide the total number of seashells equally among the three:**
   - Each person gets \(\frac{60}{3} = 20\) seashells.

Thus, each person got 20 seashells.

"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to consider the production for each year from age 5 to age 10, as the tree does not produce any fruit before age 5.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

To find the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's solve this step-by-step using algebra.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]

6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]

7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12

"Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills from the bank. Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many $5 bills he ends up with.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   - Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   - Number of $20 bills = \(\frac{1000}{20} = 50\).

2. **Losing Bills:**
   - Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   - Remaining $20 bills = \(50 - 10 = 40\).

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   - Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   - Bills used = \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\).
   - Remaining $20 bills = \(40 - 20 = 20\).

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   - Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   - Value of remaining $20 bills = \(20 \times 20 = 400\).
   - Tripled value = \(400 \times 3 = 1200\).

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   - Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we can expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made per hour - Snowballs melted per hour
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour

4. **Time to Accumulate 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball accumulation.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backward from the final count.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the concept of averages. The average distance walked by the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. This means the total distance walked by all 4 dogs combined is:

\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We know the distances walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these distances together gives:

\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance walked by the last dog, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To determine how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the loan amount, which is 40% of the home's value.
2. Determine the amount used to pay off debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.
3. Subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount to find the leftover money.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The value of John's home is $250,000. The loan amount is 40% of this value:
   \[
   \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the amount used to pay off debts, which is 60% of the loan amount:
   \[
   \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000
   \]

3. Finally, we find the leftover money by subtracting the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount:
   \[
   \text{Money left over} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
   \]

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Diaper Changes per Day:**
   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   - Jordan has 2 children.
   - Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day is \( 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \).

2. **Diaper Changes by Jordan's Wife:**
   - Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles is \( \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \).

3. **Diaper Changes by Jordan:**
   - The total number of diaper changes per day is 10.
   - Jordan's wife changes 5 of these.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is \( 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \).

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow a series of calculations based on the given information:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by jelly beans.
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Determine the difference between the true number and Tim's estimate:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Grapes eaten by Madeline:**
   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Grapes used by her brother:**
   Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice.
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Grapes used by their mother:**
   Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes.
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

4. **Total number of grapes:**
   To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we sum the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother.
   \[
   6 + 30 + 48 = 84
   \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug: \( 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \).

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day: \( 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \).

3. **Calculate the number of days required to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes to be filled: 84 holes.
   - Net holes filled per day: 3 holes/day.
   - Number of days required: \( \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \).

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given and use it to find the number of beakers Igor lost.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg requires 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table needs \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws required is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).
5. James has 40 screws in total.

To find out how many screws James will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

2. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed

"To calculate the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to break down the components of each reservation and then scale it up to the number of days the restaurant is open.

Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each, totaling \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- 1 bottle of wine at $5.

So, the total revenue per reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night, so the revenue per night is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows. We know the following:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + k = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   2c + 4k = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
c + k = 20
\]
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
k = 15
\]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
\[
c = 5
\]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
