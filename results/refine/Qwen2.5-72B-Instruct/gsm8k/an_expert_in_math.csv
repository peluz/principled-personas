"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a series of steps involving basic arithmetic and percentage calculations.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Repair costs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - 150% of the original value (which is $80,000) is calculated as:
     \[
     1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is:
     \[
     80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
     \[
     200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
     \]

Thus, the profit Josh made is:
\[
\boxed{70000}

"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. Calculate the distance James runs in one session:
   - James runs 3 sprints per session.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.
   - Therefore, the distance per session is \( 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \).

2. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week:
   - James runs 3 sessions per week.
   - The distance per session is 180 meters.
   - Therefore, the total distance per week is \( 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \).

Thus, the total distance James runs in a week is 540 meters.

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
  \[
  20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is:
  \[
  15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
  \]

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal:
  \[
  60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
  \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.
- The cost for one pair is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

There are 8 pairs in 16 glasses:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:

"Given the problem, we can set up the relationships between the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle as follows:

- Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep in Seattle.
- Let \( C \) represent the number of sheep in Charleston.
- Let \( T \) represent the number of sheep in Toulouse.

From the problem, we know:
1. Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the initial partial download, the Windows restart, and the full re-download.

1. **Initial Partial Download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Full Re-Download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The time to download the full 200 GB file is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Initial Distance Traveled Away from Home:**
   John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next 0.5 hours, he drives at 30 mph.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   \[
   \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular and overtime components.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She works 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings Calculation:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

"To determine the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the original price of the book before the discount, we can use the relationship between the discounted price and the original price. Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price.

Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. The equation representing the discounted price is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To solve for \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Thus, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to analyze the given information:

- Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
- His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip.

First, we calculate the position of the second stop:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (45 miles):
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We are given:
- The cost of the first pair of high heels is \( \$33 \).
- The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = \$66 \).

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = \$99 \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and their total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
\[
7x + 11x = 162
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
18x = 162
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
\]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[
99 + 10 = 109
\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[
\boxed{109}

"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the mean of the guesses provided by Gunter's friends. Let's break down the information:

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the daily care time for all dogs:**
   - Each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day.
   - John has 10 dogs.
   - Therefore, the total daily care time is:
     \[
     10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weekly care time:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly care time is:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

Thus, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
- Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Given the problem, we start by defining the relationships between the number of jewels each person has. Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as \( R \), the number of jewels Aaron has as \( A \), and the number of jewels Siobhan has as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Raymond has 40 jewels, so \( R = 40 \).
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so \( A = \frac{R}{2} + 5 \).
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so \( S = A - 2 \).

First, we calculate the number of jewels Aaron has:
\[
A = \frac{40}{2} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of jewels Siobhan has:
\[
S = 25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

\[

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

First, we calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both intervals:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of yogurts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per yogurt:**
   - The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - The cost per yogurt is:
     \[
     \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**
   - The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
     \[
     60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

"To determine how many lego sets John still has, we need to follow the sequence of transactions and verify the final state.

1. John starts with 13 lego sets.
2. He sells each lego set for $15, so the total amount he earns from selling the lego sets is:
   \[
   13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. John then buys 8 video games, each costing $20, so the total cost of the video games is:
   \[
   8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the amount of money he spent on the video games and the remaining money should add up to the total amount he earned from selling the lego sets:
   \[
   160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. Since the total amount he earned from selling the lego sets is $195, and he has spent $165, the remaining $30 is consistent with the problem statement.

Since John sold all 13 lego sets, he no longer has any lego sets left.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles each week.

To find his average speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour Ã— \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour Ã— \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she holds the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the dragon's flame reach:**
   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.

3. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips can be consumed given the daily calorie target and the calories already consumed.

First, let's calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. The bag has 5 servings, and each serving contains 250 calories:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily calorie target. You have a daily target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, we can find the number of grams per calorie:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat for 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the amount of beeswax required:**
   - Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs \( \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of materials:**
   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - The total revenue from selling 20 candles is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = \( 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased. We can set up the problem with the following information:

- Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.
- She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
- She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she initially had and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of blue ties John bought. Given that he spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books removed is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to achieve the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we sum the total number of pets:

\[
4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28 \text{ pets}
\]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:

"Given the relationships between the ages of Emily's children, we can set up a series of equations to solve for Jackson's age:

1. Let \( J \) represent Jackson's age.
2. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( (J + 5) + 2 = J + 7 \).
4. James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

From the equation for Corey's age:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time and then calculate his improved time after a 10% speed increase.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - A 10% improvement in speed means Gerald can now run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - Gerald's improved time is \( 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \) seconds.

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the given information to set up equations.

Let:
- \( D \) be the number of dogs.
- \( C \) be the number of cats.
- \( R \) be the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of dogs \( D \) is 60.
2. There are two cats for every dog, so \( C = 2D \).
3. The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

First, we calculate the number of cats:
\[
C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[
D + C = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

Then, we find the number of rabbits:
\[
R = D + C - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
\]

Finally, we calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
\]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
348

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce, given that the volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked and each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes.

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Since the volume is halved when cooked, the initial volume of tomatoes must be twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Volume of sauce: 32 ounces
   - Initial volume of tomatoes: \( 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \)

2. **Calculate the number of 16-ounce cans used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - Number of cans: \( \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \)

3. **Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Total number of tomatoes: \( 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \)

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Driving Through**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.
   - 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
3. **Cars Taking an Exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To determine how many potted plants Mary will have remaining, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary initially has.
2. Add the number of new potted plants she received.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants she plans to give away.

First, let's calculate the initial number of potted plants:
- Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the total number of initial potted plants is:
  \[
  2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}
  \]

Next, add the 18 new potted plants she received:
\[
80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants}
\]

Finally, subtract the number of potted plants she plans to give away:
- Mary will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the number of potted plants she will give away is:
  \[
  1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
  \]

Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants:
\[
98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}
\]

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Summing these times:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Given that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes} \]

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine Lylah's salary four years ago, given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

Let \( L \) represent Lylah's salary four years ago. According to the problem, Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so we can write the equation:

\[ 40000 = L + 0.30L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30L \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, we need to calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%) as Adrien's:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day.
   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday: \(6 + 6 = 12\) hours.

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   - She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - Therefore, on these days, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.
   - Total for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

4. **Total sleep for the week:**
   - Add the hours from all the days together.

"To determine how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

"To determine the total earnings from the bike inflation service, we need to calculate the cost for inflating the tires of bicycles, tricycles, and a unicycle, and then sum these costs.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people each had both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people each had all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person had their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[
10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires}

1. Dave ate 14 fries:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries:
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:
   \[
   x - 21 - (3 \times 3) = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. Ants carried off one fry:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. Five fries were left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
\[
x = 48
\]

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( 48 \).

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the weekly schedule and then extend it over the 16 weeks of the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. Therefore, the total number of hours per day on these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours for these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. Therefore, the total number of hours per day on these days is:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours for these days is:
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week to find the total number of hours per week:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
272

"To determine the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert the lengths of each type of baked good to feet and then sum them up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - The total length of all the baked goods is the sum of the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes.
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

**Blake's Distance:**
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards (100 yards there + 100 yards back).
- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there + 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
- Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards.
- Difference: \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

The winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable to this scenario of repeated percentage increases.

1. **Initial Price:**
   - \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars

2. **Increase Rate:**
   - \( r = 20\% = 0.20 \)

3. **Number of Periods:**
   - Each period is 2 months, and 36 months is equivalent to \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) periods.

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The formula for the final price after \( n \) periods is:
     \[
     P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
     \]
   - Simplifying inside the parentheses:
     \[
     P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator to find \( (1.20)^{18} \):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P_{18} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information:

1. Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
2. Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
3. Jan's age is given as 30.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

Now, let's solve the second equation:
\[ M - 2 = 19 \]
\[ M = 19 + 2 \]

"To determine the winning margin between the two teams in the 4 by 400 meter relay, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the race.

**Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team):**
- Each of the four members runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team 1: \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so they complete it in \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they complete it in \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they complete it in \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds.
- Total time for Team 2: \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

The difference in their total times is:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \]

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we start by breaking down the information provided:

1. **Rats:**
   - Rats are kept in 3 cages.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Since each cage has one hamster, the total number of hamsters is 10.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can set up the equation for the total straw distributed as follows:
\[ \text{Total straw} = (\text{straw for rats}) + (\text{straw for hamsters}) + (\text{straw for rabbits}) \]

First, calculate the straw for the hamsters:
\[ \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces/hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the straw for the rabbits:
\[ \text{Straw for rabbits} = 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, express the straw for the rats in terms of \( r \):
\[ \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces/rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

Using the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after \( n \) months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

"To determine the daily insect consumption for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement and then convert it to a daily amount.

1. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
   \[
   3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week}
   \]

2. To find the daily requirement, we divide the total weekly requirement by 7 days:
   \[
   35 \, \text{pounds/week} \div 7 \, \text{days/week} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day}
   \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and placed back in the yard.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.

"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First month collection**: She collects three times the initial number of cards. Therefore, she collects \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. **Second month collection**: She collects 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. Thus, she collects \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. **Third month collection**: She collects twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, she collects \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, we sum up all the cards she has collected over the three months and her initial number of cards:
- Initial cards: 20
- First month: 60
- Second month: 40

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for \( d \) and \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Sloane counted 100 customers.

2. **Second Day:**
   - She counted 50 more customers than the first day.
   - Number of customers on the second day: \( 100 + 50 = 150 \).

3. **Total Number of Customers Over Three Days:**
   - The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

4. **Third Day:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day.
   - The equation for the total number of customers over the three days is:
     \[
     100 + 150 + x = 500
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will owe after adding the 10% interest and then determine how much she will have paid over 12 months. Finally, we'll find the remaining balance.

1. **Calculate the total amount to be paid back:**
   - Principal amount: $2000
   - Interest: 10% of $2000
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200
   \]
   - Total amount to be paid back:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months:**
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Number of months: 12
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining balance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Total amount paid} = 2200 - 1980 = 220
   \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of flower in the vase. We know there are 4 roses. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias can be calculated as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Next, we find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

"Given the problem, we start by defining the current ages of the individuals involved:

- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
  \[
  \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
  \]
- Harriet is half the age of Zack:
  \[
  \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
  \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

To find the average age of the three individuals in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we first need to calculate the points scored by the other three students: Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.

1. **Naomi's score**: Given as 68 points.
2. **Yuri's score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score.
   - Half of Naomi's score: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
   - Yuri's score: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)
3. **Brianna's score**: Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi's score.
   - Brianna's score: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Next, we sum the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the sum of the scores of the other three students from the total:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Thus, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after the changes, we start by calculating the new total number of cards and the number of water type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

The new total number of cards is:
- 30 fire type cards
- 34 grass type cards
- 32 water type cards

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The probability that a randomly picked card will be a water type is given by the ratio of the number of water type cards to the total number of cards, expressed as a percentage:
\[ \text{Probability} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Probability} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

Given:
- The first aquarium has 4 snails.
- The second aquarium has 32 snails.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2f) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

Thus, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[ 7 \]

Final answer:

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.
- Let \( A_a \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we can use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the information that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Lines in the solo song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **Lines in the first scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines.

3. **Lines in the second scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

4. **Total lines Sean has to memorize:**
   - Lines from the song: 54
   - Lines from the first scene: 36
   - Lines from the second scene: 48
   - Total: \( 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \)

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

First, we calculate the number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of stars in the two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of chocolate bars. Given that there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we determine the number of chocolate bars that the adults will receive. Since there are 4 adults and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars the adults receive from the total number of chocolate bars gives us the number of chocolate bars left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will receive:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

"To determine the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Loaves Produced:**
   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Morning Sales:**
   Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Loaves Remaining After Morning Sales:**
   Subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total loaves produced:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Afternoon and Evening Sales:**
   Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
   These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so:
   \[
   \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, his weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Weekly weight loss}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we start by calculating the daily consumption and then extend that to a weekly total.

1. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Three family members each consume 3 eggs per day: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
   - The remaining two family members each consume 2 eggs per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
   - Total daily consumption: \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

2. **Weekly Consumption:**
   - Since the family eats eggs every day, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
   - Total weekly consumption: \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"Given the relationships between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( T = J + 5 \) (Trent is 5 years older than Jane)
2. \( J = Q - 3 \) (Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn)

We are given that Quinn is 30 years old, so \( Q = 30 \).

Substituting \( Q = 30 \) into the second equation:
\[ J = 30 - 3 \]
\[ J = 27 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ T = 27 + 5 \]
\[ T = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided to set up equations and solve for the unknowns. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.
- The total number of players on the team is 105.

We can set up the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is given by:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils that Jam and her sister, Meg, have, we start by calculating the number of pencils in each of Jam's boxes.

Given:
- Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils.
- Meg has 46 pencils.

First, let's find out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we calculate the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils, given that each box holds 8 pencils:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannonâ€™s iced coffee is, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannonâ€™s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To determine how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the previous shopping trip.
2. Determine the total discount applied using the rewards and the coupon.
3. Subtract the total discount from the current shopping trip's total.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the previous shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. They earn $1 off for every $20 spent.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of hot dogs each person ate.

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
2. Thomas ate three times as many hot dogs as Luke. Therefore, Thomas ate:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]
3. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate. Therefore, John ate:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate compared to Luke. We subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group has \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

With the number of cows and chickens determined, we can calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

1. Let \( M \) be the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks. According to the problem, \( M = 3 \).

2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is given by \( 4M - 5 \). Substituting \( M = 3 \):
   \[
   4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]

3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

4. Let \( O \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is 50. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   M + (4M - 5) + 3(4M - 5) + O = 50
   \]

5. Substituting the known values:
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50
   \]

6. Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   31 + O = 50
   \]

7. Solving for \( O \):
   \[
   O = 50 - 31 = 19
   \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

1. Let \( E \) represent the number of points Erin had initially.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).
3. According to the problem, after scoring these 14 points, Erin has three times as many points as Sara, who has 8 points.

We can express this relationship with the equation:
\[
E + 14 = 3 \times 8
\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[
E + 14 = 24
\]

To find \( E \), we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
\[
E = 24 - 14
\]
\[
E = 10
\]

Thus, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

Next, we sum up the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:

"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. **Milk from the first half of the sheep:**
   - Mary has 30 sheep, and half of them (15 sheep) each produce 1 kg of milk per day.
   - Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:
     \[
     15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Milk from the second half of the sheep:**
   - The other half of the sheep (also 15 sheep) each produce 2 kg of milk per day.
   - Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:
     \[
     15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Total milk collected:**
   - Adding the milk from both halves of the sheep:

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount ($3,650),
   - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (10% or 0.10),
   - \( t \) is the time in years (5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) years).

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   I = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   \[
   A = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   A = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   The monthly payment is the total amount divided by the number of months:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{A}{n}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of months (5).

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}

"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can use the information that he has 12.8 hectares left after selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land. This means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land remaining.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation representing the remaining land is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To determine the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent recording the song:**
   - Carol spends 4 hours writing the song.
   - She spends half that time recording it.
   - Time spent recording = \( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Convert all times to the same unit (minutes):**
   - Time spent writing = \( 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Time spent recording = \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Time spent editing = 90 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total work time:**
   - Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
   - Total work time = \( 240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Determine the percentage of the total work time spent editing:**
   - Percentage spent editing = \( \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \)
   - Percentage spent editing = \( \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \).

"To determine the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Number of spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Number of millipedes**: She saw \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many millipedes as spiders.
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Number of stink bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of each type of bug:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

Thus, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

"To determine the energy savings, we need to calculate the reduction in energy consumption over the specified period. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the original daily energy consumption:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts (0.9 kilowatts) per hour.
   - If it is used for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     0.9 \text{ kW} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7.2 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new daily energy consumption:**
   - If the usage time is reduced by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     0.9 \text{ kW} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2.7 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original and new daily energy consumption:
     \[
     7.2 \text{ kWh} - 2.7 \text{ kWh} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:**
   - The total energy savings over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Therefore, the total energy savings in 30 days is 135 kilowatt-hours.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of the meat and cheese required to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Total number of people = 20.
   - Number of sandwiches required = \(\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches \(\times\) 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches \(\times\) 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds \(\times\) $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds \(\times\) $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, Tyson would spend \(\boxed{50}\) dollars on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the initial quantities of corn and cannolis at Allan's house. Given that there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and Allan has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns:

\[
\text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:

\[
\text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100
\]

Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis. Therefore, the new number of corns is:

\[
\text{New number of corns} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Finally, we find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[
\text{Combined total} = 60 + 100 = 160
\]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[
160

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can break down the information given:

1. Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps.
2. He completed half of his steps (5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
3. He did an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with his friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Next, we know that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps he had taken by the end of his jog is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ (goal)} - 2,000 \text{ (steps left)} = 8,000 \text{ steps} \]

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had taken before the jog from the total steps he had taken by the end of the jog:
\[ 8,000 \text{ (total steps by the end of the jog)} - 6,000 \text{ (steps before the jog)} = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

Thus, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided:

- Let \( J_t \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.
- Let \( J_s \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
- Let \( S_t \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the tallest trees.
- Let \( S_s \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.
- Let \( S_a \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the average trees.

From the problem, we know:
- \( J_t = 30 \)
- \( J_s = \frac{J_t}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)
- \( S_t = 2 \times J_t = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- \( S_s = 3 \times J_s = 3 \times 15 = 45 \)
- \( S_a = 0 \)

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ J_t + J_s + J_a + S_t + S_s + S_a = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 30 + 15 + J_a + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + J_a = 500 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):

\[ J_a = 500 - 150 \]
\[ J_a = 350 \]

Thus, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each, so:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D = 180 - C \) into the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the elevation at which the comb landed and then calculate the difference between this elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's initial elevation is 10,000 feet.
2. The comb falls 4,000 feet from this elevation: 
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]
   So, the comb lands at an elevation of 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver's current elevation is 3,000 feet.

To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of cats on the rock, which is 50. 

Next, we account for the cats that were carried away by the four boats. Each boat carried away 5 cats, so the total number of cats carried away is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting the number of cats carried away by the boats from the initial number of cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Then, we need to determine how many of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. Therefore, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats to find the number of cats left on the rock:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of cats left on the rock is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, and then find the difference between these original prices.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.

2. **Minibusses**: Each minibus can hold 30 employees, and there are 6 minibusses.
   \[
   6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees/minibus} = 180 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Minivans**: Each minivan can hold 15 employees, and there are 10 minivans.
   \[
   10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees/minivan} = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

Next, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[
240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Number of homemade bird feeders**: 3
2. **Number of store-bought bird feeders**: 3
3. **Birds attracted by each store-bought feeder**: 20
4. **Birds attracted by each homemade feeder**: 20 + 10 = 30

First, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Thus, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the individual costs of the soup, bagel, and cake, and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Cost of the soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \( 4 / 2 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost: \( 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \) dollars.

Thus, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To determine the number of cards Kenny started with, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided.

Kenny sells his cards for $1.5 each and keeps 1/3 of his cards. Therefore, he sells 2/3 of his cards. The total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $150 (since he needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left for spending cash).

Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}C \).

The revenue from selling the cards is given by:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 150 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 150 \]
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3} = 1 \]
\[ 1C = 150 \]

Thus, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[ C = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

26"
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6. 

Next, we calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this half:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order, we first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the discount. The items and their costs are as follows:

- Set of pots and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: \(5 \times 5.00 = 25.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

132.00"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we first calculate the total cost of these items:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

The total cost is:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Money saved from her allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

The total amount of money Dora has is:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"To determine the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce, we can follow these steps:

   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. **Prince Walter** slew twice the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. **Prince Bruce** slew one-fifth of the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using mathematical reasoning.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George initially had $5.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which is \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   - The number of candy bars George bought is \( \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \).

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To solve the problem, we start with the total number of lollipops Ray had, which is 25. Ray decided to keep 5 lollipops for himself, so the number of lollipops he shared is:

25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

These 20 lollipops were then shared equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends:

20 Ã· 4 = 5 lollipops

Thus, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the weight of each piece of cake. Given that the entire cake weighs 20 ounces and is divided into 8 equal pieces, the weight of each piece is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each piece} = \frac{\text{Total weight of the cake}}{\text{Number of pieces}} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the total weight of the cake they have consumed is:

\[ \text{Weight of cake consumed} = 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake consumed from the total weight of the cake:

\[ \text{Weight of remaining cake} = 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by using the given information: the area of the room is 360 square feet, and the length of the room is 3 yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of one raised bed:**
   The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
   \]
   For one raised bed:
   \[
   V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all raised beds:**
   Since Bob has 10 raised beds:
   \[
   \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of bags of potting soil required:**
   Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the potting soil:**
   Each bag costs $12:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To determine the total number of cards, we need to calculate the number of each color of card and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, we sum up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

"To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of spotted puppies.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, with 3 of them having spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, with 4 of them having spots.

First, we find the total number of puppies:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we find the total number of spotted puppies:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of spotted puppies, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
35%"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** \(2 \text{ boxes} \times 1 \text{ pound/box} = 2 \text{ pounds}\)
   - **Carrots:** \(4 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ pounds/bag} = 48 \text{ pounds}\)
   - **Hay:** \(42 \text{ bales} \times 75 \text{ pounds/bale} = 3150 \text{ pounds}\)
   - **Oats:** \(20 \text{ sacks} \times 65 \text{ pounds/sack} = 1300 \text{ pounds}\)

2. **Sum the weights to find the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of carrot sticks Matt must eat to be allowed to have five cookies. According to the given conditions, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of carrot sticks} + 2 \]

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks. The equation becomes:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to be allowed to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that this combined length represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are two remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 0.1 \times 100\% = 10\% \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. This principle helps us avoid double-counting the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( |A| \) as the number of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( |B| \) as the number of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( |A \cap B| \) as the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.
- \( |A \cup B| \) as the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \)
- \( |B| = 6 \)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we calculate the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both:
\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]
\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either from the total number of kids in the class:
\[
|U| - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of songs each person has on their media player. Gabriel has 20 songs, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each person can add to their media player, given that the maximum capacity is 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather effectively gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

5. **Converting the Cost to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

- **Second layer**: 3 girls, each 64 inches tall.
- **Third layer**: 2 girls, each 64 inches tall.
- **Top layer**: 1 girl, 60 inches tall.

First, we calculate the total height for each layer:

1. **Bottom layer**:
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer**:
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer**:
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer**:
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we sum the heights of all the layers to find the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

   - Since \( B = 14 \):
     \[
     A + 4 = 3 \times 14
     \]
     \[
     A + 4 = 42
     \]

5. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - Subtract 4 from both sides:
     \[
     A = 42 - 4
     \]
     \[
     A = 38

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up and solve an equation based on the given costs.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]
3. David found half the number of insects that Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B
   \]

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[
B = 2D
\]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[
(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4D + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
4D = 36
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
D = 9
\]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]
\[
B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we start by adding the fractions of the skein they each used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

First, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Next, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the relationships between the number of cookies made by each person. We know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. According to the problem, Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Next, we are told that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Thus, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"To solve the problem, we first calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, which total to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, which total to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

After giving her $80, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"To solve the problem, we start by converting Rob's time from hours to minutes. Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate double the time it takes Rob:

\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than this doubled time. Therefore, we add 40 minutes to 240 minutes:

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle the house.

"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the picking rate for each individual and then sum these rates.

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
   - Kathy's rate = 2 * 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.

5. **Total picking rate:**
   - Total rate = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
   - Total rate = 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour
   - Total rate = 29 quarts/hour

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the current daily cost of electricity.
2. Calculate the additional daily cost due to the new device.
3. Determine the total daily cost after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.
5. Find the difference between the two weekly costs.

**Step 1: Calculate the current daily cost of electricity.**

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, and the cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50.

\[
\text{Current daily cost} = 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 18 \, \text{\$}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the additional daily cost due to the new device.**

The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.

\[
\text{Additional daily cost} = 2 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3 \, \text{\$}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the total daily cost after adding the new device.**

\[
\text{Total daily cost after adding the device} = 18 \, \text{\$} + 3 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.**

There are 7 days in a week.

\[
\text{Current weekly cost} = 18 \, \text{\$} \times 7 = 126 \, \text{\$}
\]
\[
\text{Weekly cost after adding the device} = 21 \, \text{\$} \times 7 = 147 \, \text{\$}
\]

**Step 5: Find the difference between the two weekly costs.**

\[
\text{Difference} = 147 \, \text{\$} - 126 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$}
\]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we start by calculating the rate at which one person can paint a house.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.
2. Converting days to hours, since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take one person \(10 \times 24 = 240\) hours to paint a whole house.
3. If 5 people are working together, the total time required to paint the house is divided by 5. Therefore, the time it would take 5 people to paint a whole house is \(240 \div 5 = 48\) hours.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have, given the relationships between the number of sofas and chairs each has.

Let's denote:
- \( C_O \) as the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- \( S_O \) as the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- \( C_J \) as the number of chairs Jenna has.
- \( S_J \) as the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
3. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
4. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).

First, we use the information that Ophelia has 20 sofas to find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Regular Routine**: Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for most of the weeks.
2. **Variations**:
   - For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each week.
   - For 1 week, he spent 6 hours.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks he followed his regular routine:
- Total weeks: 8
- Weeks with 5 hours: 2
- Week with 6 hours: 1
- Weeks with 4 hours: \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\)

Now, calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he spent 5 hours each:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, calculate the total hours for the 1 week he spent 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, add all these hours together to get the total:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"To solve this problem, we will follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of passengers at each step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40 \text{ passengers remain}
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ passengers get on}
   \]
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80 \text{ passengers are now on the bus}
   \]
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59 \text{ passengers remain}
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus compared to those who got off:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ passengers get on}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step using algebraic reasoning.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the given values and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
3. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer, which means the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
\[ \text{Total cost of computer and printer} = \$1,100 + \$700 = \$1,800 \]

The remaining amount, which is the total cost of the 2 monitors, is:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = \$2,400 - \$1,800 = \$600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{\$600}{2} = \$300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, which is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]

1. **Total number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jeff gets when the total amount is 100 dollars and Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad.

Let \( B \) represent the amount Brad receives. According to the problem, Jeff receives \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is the sum of what Jeff and Brad receive:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we start by understanding the relationship between the number of toys in James's play set and the number of toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger.

1. James's play set has 80 toys.
2. Jonathan needs a play set that is five times the size of James's play set:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]
3. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398
   \]

Thus, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To determine the total cost Daniel has to spend on the items he wants to buy, we first calculate the cost of each type of item before applying the discount:

- Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Cost of two pens: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times 12.00 = 12.00\)
- Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times 10.00 = 10.00\)

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

The shop offers a 10% discount on all purchased items. To find the discount amount:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend:
\[27.00\]"

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the amount of coffee Octavia drinks daily. Given that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of this, she drinks:

\[ \text{Octavia's daily coffee intake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan's daily coffee intake is:

\[ \text{Juan's daily coffee intake} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has advised him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommended amount of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each person's weight.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's weight:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the average weight of the three friends is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
1. Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature when set to 450 degrees:

1. The actual temperature when set to 450 degrees is 468 degrees.
2. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
3. The percentage error is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to be 520 degrees, so we set up the equation:
\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To determine the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses, we first need to calculate the value of Juan's house, which is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.

Herb's house value: $76,000

To find 30% of Herb's house value:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The combined value of the two houses is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought to the church's charity event.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups:
\[ \text{Number of dishes} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cups and dishes her friend brought. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy:
\[ \text{Number of dishes brought by her friend} = 24 + 20 = 44 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy's total utensils:
\[ 12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36 \text{ utensils} \]

Her friend's total utensils:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} + 44 \text{ dishes} = 84 \text{ utensils} \]

Finally, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total hours worked by both John and Jill, and then determine their respective earnings. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

**Step 1: Calculate the total hours worked by Jill.**
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

**Step 2: Calculate the total hours worked by John.**
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

**Step 3: Calculate the earnings for both John and Jill.**
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

**Step 4: Determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill.**
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

Thus, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can determine the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles its height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( h(n) \). The height of the beanstalk can be expressed as:
\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
\[ 4 \times 2^n > 20 \]

First, we solve the inequality:
\[ 2^n > \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ 2^n > 5 \]

Next, we find the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by testing successive values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 0 \):
  \[ 2^0 = 1 \]
  \[ 1 \not> 5 \]

- For \( n = 1 \):
  \[ 2^1 = 2 \]
  \[ 2 \not> 5 \]

- For \( n = 2 \):
  \[ 2^2 = 4 \]
  \[ 4 \not> 5 \]

- For \( n = 3 \):
  \[ 2^3 = 8 \]
  \[ 8 > 5 \]

Thus, the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies the inequality is \( n = 3 \).

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To solve the problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to cover the cost of his dental work, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an additional cost of $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

"To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to calculate the speed of the plane.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

The speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa.

Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, his production rate is:
\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's production rate is:
\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each of them can produce in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:
\[ \text{Ruiz's total} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

"To determine Patrick's total earnings from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first four hours.**
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Earnings per hour = \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Total earnings for four hours = \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

**Step 2: Calculate earnings for the next two hours.**
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Earnings per hour = \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Total earnings for two hours = \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

**Step 3: Sum the earnings from both periods.**

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per mile is:
     \[
     \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the total number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months per year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can handle by the number of rotations per year:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years}

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. This means the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:

\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Monthly funding for the first 5 months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: $20,000 * 5 = $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for initial 5 months + Cost for additional 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to sum the amounts of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so the total for the second player is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player consumed 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year.
   \[
   \text{Total loads per year} = 2 \, \text{loads/week} \times 52 \, \text{weeks/year} = 104 \, \text{loads/year}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of water used per year:**
   Each load uses 20 gallons of water.
   \[
   \text{Total water used per year} = 104 \, \text{loads/year} \times 20 \, \text{gallons/load} = 2080 \, \text{gallons/year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the water used:**
   The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon.
   \[
   \text{Total cost per year} = 2080 \, \text{gallons/year} \times 0.15 \, \text{dollars/gallon} = 312 \, \text{dollars/year}

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of seats in the auditorium. Given that there are 4 rows with 18 seats each, the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Subtracting the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats gives us the remaining seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of these remaining seats are occupied by the parents:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Finally, the rest of the seats are occupied by the students. We find the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ 36 \]

"To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to account for all the pieces he chews and the pieces he gives away.

1. **Gum Chewing During School:**
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours.
   - The school day lasts 8 hours.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces he chews during school is:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Additional Gum Chewing:**
   - Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.
   - Jim chews 1 piece after dinner.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional pieces he chews is:
     \[
     1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 2 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Total Pieces Chewed:**
   - The total number of pieces Jim chews during the day is:
     \[
     4 \text{ pieces} + 2 \text{ pieces} = 6 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Remaining Pieces Before Giving Away:**
   - Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum.
   - After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:
     \[
     20 \text{ pieces} - 6 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces}
     \]

5. **Giving Away Half of the Remaining Gum:**
   - Jim gives half of the remaining 14 pieces to his sister.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces he gives away is:
     \[
     \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
     \]

6. **Final Number of Pieces Left:**
   - The number of pieces Jim has left at the end of the day is:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. 

Given:
- Total cost for the classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10
- Maximum acceptable cost per class: $10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Therefore, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum value of \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10. This can be expressed as the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Thus, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we start by calculating the daily and weekly customer processing rates for each.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Similarly, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - The cost of one apple is $1.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - The cost of one orange is $1.10.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - The total cost is \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The dimensions of the hole are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.

The volume \( V \) of the hole can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to shovel this volume of earth. Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) can be calculated as:
\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to sum the base price and the costs of all the additional features. Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1500

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

The next three days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sally has. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, and Janey has 21 books. This can be expressed as:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first isolate the term involving \( S \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional growth needed to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional amount.

First, convert the current height from feet to inches:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, calculate the additional growth needed:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. Therefore, the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Thus, the bamboo will reach 600 inches in 12 days.

"James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. When 8 more dogs join the shelter, he needs to buy 8 additional toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs. After purchasing these toys, he discovers that the number of dogs has doubled to 24. To accommodate these 24 dogs, he needs to buy 12 more toys, bringing the total to 24 toys. Finally, when he returns and finds that 3 dogs have left, he now needs toys for only 21 dogs. Since he already has 24 toys, he can return or not purchase the 3 extra toys.

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

"To determine Skyler's investment, we start by calculating the contributions of Dylan and Frances, and then find the remaining amount for Skyler.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invests \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

2. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invests \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480
   \]

4. **Skyler's Investment:**
   The remaining amount after both Dylan's and Frances's investments is Skyler's investment.
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 720 - 480 = 240
   \]

Thus, Skyler's investment is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we start by calculating the total number of signatures they currently have. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Adding these together gives:

\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \]

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining Karen's hourly wage. Given that Lorie earns $10 per hour and Karen earns twice that amount, Karen's hourly wage is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate Karen's daily earnings. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the group and compare it to the elevator's maximum capacity.

1. The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg.
2. There are 9 people in the elevator (Jack and 8 other adults).
3. The average weight of an adult is 80 kg.

First, we calculate the total weight of the 9 people:
\[ 9 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has and then sum them up. Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]

4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298
\]

Thus, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[
298

"To determine the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To determine the total time Chris took to mow his lawn by using both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time for each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

1. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes

2. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - 40 minutes

3. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes

4. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes

5. **Total time to mow the lawn:**
   - Add the time for ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode.
   - \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the cost of the candies. Given that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40, we can calculate the total cost of the lollipops:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost gives us the cost of the four candies:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Thus, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"To determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then extend that to the total period.

First, let's calculate Rong's monthly savings:
- Rong saves 20 coins every month.

Next, we calculate Neil's monthly savings:
- Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. Therefore, Neil's additional savings per month are:
  \[
  \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins}
  \]
- Thus, Neil's total monthly savings are:
  \[
  20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total savings over ten years (120 months):
- Rong's total savings over ten years:
  \[
  20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
  \]
- Neil's total savings over ten years:
  \[
  28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
  \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:
\[
2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins}
\]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let \( T \) represent the total bill. The heartworm check can be expressed as:
\[ 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To determine the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.50, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.00, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5.00
- Total cost for apples: $6.00
- Total cost for oranges: $21.00

The total price for the crate is \(5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

2. **Determine the number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
   \]

   Total chairs currently available = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
   \[
   8 + 40 = 48

"To determine how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by each student and then compare this total to the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find this, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Thus:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:
\[
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 255 = 145
\]

Therefore, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the speed of the turtle. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat runs at 15 feet per second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their fundraising goal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the hourly fundraising rate:**
   - The firefighters raised $2100 in the first 3 hours.
   - The hourly rate is:
     \[
     \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount needed:**
   - The total goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - The remaining amount needed is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total Water Usage by the City:**
   The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Industrial Water Usage:**
   80% of the city's water usage is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes is:
   \[
   40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%
   \]

3. **Non-Industrial Water Usage:**
   To find the percentage of the river's water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial water usage from the total water usage by the city:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $50.00:

\[
0.10 \times 50.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final total:

\[
50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Marcus' total bill is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops of ice cream, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50, and Erin has $6.00.

First, let's determine how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Next, we calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 2 paid scoops gives her 1 free scoop, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages based on the given information:

- Dora's age is 15 years.
- Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
- Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.

First, calculate Dora's father's age:
\[ \text{Dora's father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, calculate Dora's mother's age:
\[ \text{Dora's mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

"To determine the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to sum the weights of each individual book. Let's break it down:

1. **Math and Science Books**: Each weighs 2 pounds. Since there are two books, the total weight for these is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **French Book**: Weighs 4 pounds.

3. **English Book**: Weighs 3 pounds.

4. **History Book**: Weighs twice as much as the English book, so:
   \[
   2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we sum the weights of all the books:
\[
4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 4 \text{ pounds (French)} + 3 \text{ pounds (English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (History)} = 17 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we start by calculating the votes for candidates A and B.

1. Candidate A received 20% of the total votes. Given that there were 100 voters:
   \[
   \text{Votes for A} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}
   \]

2. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Votes for B} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes}
   \]

3. The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidates A and B together are:
   \[
   \text{Votes for A and B} = 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes}
   \]

4. The remaining votes, which were given to candidate C, are:
   \[
   \text{Votes for C} = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes}
   \]

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we sum the total costs to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

Given:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the rides on the usual days and the rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
   - This happens for 2 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought from the pet store. Let's break down the information and use algebra to find the solution.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. Let:
- \( x \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
3. After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To determine Jamie's total earnings for working 11 hours on Tuesday, we need to break down her pay into regular and overtime components.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20.
   - She works 8 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160.

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so the number of overtime hours is 11 - 8 = 3 hours.
   - Her overtime rate is 150% of her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = 1.5 * $20/hour = $30/hour.
   - Overtime pay = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90.

3. **Total Pay:**
   - Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   - Total pay = $160 + $90 = $250.

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work last Tuesday.

"To determine how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we need to calculate the sale price of the jeans and then subtract this from the amount he pays with.

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are on sale for 25% off.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 0.25 \times 40 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the sale price:**
   Subtract the discount amount from the original price.
   \[
   \text{Sale price} = 40 - 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the change Mike will receive:**
   Mike pays with a $50 bill.
   \[
   \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over.

"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3
4. **Monthly salary per employee**: $4000

First, calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of employees after three months:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary cost for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Since we need the total amount of money paid over three months, we multiply the monthly salary cost by 3:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To determine the total duration of the caroling, we need to sum the durations of the songs the choir plans to sing. The choir will sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once. 

First, we calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- Each performance of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds.
- Since it will be sung twice, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is:
  \[
  150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Next, we consider the time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.
- Since it will be sung once, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is:
  \[
  240 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the overall caroling duration:
\[
300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
\]

Therefore, the total time the choir will be caroling is:

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their respective hourly rates and then compute the difference in their earnings for 20 hours of work.

1. **Billy's Hourly Rate:**
   - Initial rate: $10.00 per hour.
   - After 2 months, raise: $0.50 per hour.
     \[
     10.00 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]
   - On his first anniversary, another raise: $1.00 per hour.
     \[
     10.50 + 1.00 = 11.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Sally's Hourly Rate:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
     \[
     10.00 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

3. **Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - Billy's earnings for 20 hours:
     \[
     11.50 \times 20 = 230 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
     \[
     10.50 \times 20 = 210 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in their earnings:
     \[
     230 - 210 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"To solve the problem, we first calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels. 

The cost of one loaf of bread is $2, so the cost of 3 loaves is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one bagel is $1, so the cost of 2 bagels is:
\[ 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels is:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first calculate Nikita's score. Given that Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can express this mathematically as:

Nikita's score = (1/2) * Pierson's score + 11

Substituting Pierson's score of 278 points:

Nikita's score = (1/2) * 278 + 11
Nikita's score = 139 + 11
Nikita's score = 150

Next, we find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita by adding their individual scores:

Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total points = 278 + 150
Total points = 428

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we start by calculating the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down the problem into two parts: the hours played in the first two weeks and the hours played in the following week.

1. **First 2 weeks:**
   - Kris plays for half an hour every day.
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - Total hours played in the first 2 weeks: \(0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours}\).

2. **Following week:**
   - Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
   - There are 7 days in 1 week.
   - Total hours played in the following week: \(2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours}\).

3. **Total hours played so far:**
   - Sum of the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the following week: \(7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours}\).

4. **Hours needed to reach the achievement:**
   - The achievement requires 30 hours of play.
   - Hours still needed: \(30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours}\).

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To determine the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the ratio of these two numbers.

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third grade: 340 out of 500 students passed.
   - Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 students passed.
   - Fifth grade: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth grade. The fourth grade's pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \). Therefore, the fifth grade's pass rate is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \). So, \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \) fifth graders passed.

2. **Calculate the total number of students who passed:**
   - Total passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students.

3. **Calculate the total number of students who took the test:**
   - Total students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.

4. **Calculate the overall pass rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = \( \frac{\text{Total passed}}{\text{Total students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%.

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine the initial amount of tea in gallons at the beginning of the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students:
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. Add the tea consumed by both groups to find the total amount of tea consumed:

"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order**: Dale started with 100 candies.
2. **Candies Sold**: Dale sold 150 candies.
3. **Additional Order**: Dale then ordered 100 more candies.

First, we calculate the deficit after selling 150 candies:
- Dale sold 150 candies but only had 100 initially, so he needed 50 more candies to fulfill the order.

Next, we account for the additional 100 candies he ordered:
- After selling 150 candies, he had 0 candies left and needed 50 more.
- He then ordered 100 more candies, so he now has 100 - 50 = 50 candies left.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To determine the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern described in the problem. The number of students doubles at the end of each month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year.

Let's break down the growth month by month:

- **Initial number of students (beginning of January):** \(10\)
- **End of January:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
- **End of February:** \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
- **End of March:** \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
- **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
- **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

By the end of May, the number of students on campus is 320. To find the number of additional students who joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

\[
320 - 10 = 310
\]

Thus, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average number of branches Felix climbs per day based on his weekly earnings and the cost per branch.

First, we calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week. Given that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and made $105 in total, we can use the following formula:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbs per day is:

     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean have made their S'mores and account for the marshmallows they dropped.

1. **Initial Marshmallows**: The bag contains 35 marshmallows.
2. **Marshmallows Used by John**: John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
3. **Marshmallows Used by DeSean**: DeSean makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
4. **Marshmallows Dropped**: They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
\[ 9 \text{ (John)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, subtract the total number of marshmallows used and lost from the initial number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since there are 2 kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:

"To determine the total amount of money used by Jack and his three friends, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses over the 4-hour period and then convert that into dollars.

First, let's establish the play time per quarter for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.

Next, we calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we sum the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \( 24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total volume as:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ \text{Amount of oil} = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:

"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats at $500 each.
- The total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows at $1500 each.
- The total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Finally, we add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tasks John completes in one day:**
   - John completes 30 cycles per day.
   - Each cycle consists of 5 tasks.
   - Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is:
     \[
     30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate John's daily earnings:**
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, John's daily earnings are:
     \[
     150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$180 \text{ per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate John's weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, his weekly earnings are:
     \[
     \$180 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260 \text{ per week}
     \]

Thus, John makes:

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cards:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Thus, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy collected, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Thus, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs.

     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Milly will lose:

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Mason travels at a speed of 8 miles per hour. He first travels for 4 hours, and then after a rest, he travels for another 6 hours. We can calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then sum them up.

For the first segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives us the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel the same distance that three kangaroos can cover in 18 hours.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all her financial resources and the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the new cost to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let \( x \) represent the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of goats remaining in both farms after Mr. Smith sells some of them.

Initially, Mr. Smith has:
- 55 goats in Farm X
- 45 goats in Farm Y

He sells:
- 10 goats from Farm X
- Twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats

Now, we calculate the remaining goats in each farm:
- Goats left in Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\)
- Goats left in Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from each farm:
- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\)

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the average cost per pair of shoes that James pays, we start by calculating the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year. Given that he buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, we can calculate the annual total as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the given discount, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, the cost for 3 baskets of green food is:
     \[
     3 \times 25 = 75
     \]

2. Calculate the total cost of the red food before the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - Therefore, the cost for 3 baskets of red food is:
     \[
     3 \times 18 = 54
     \]

3. Apply the discount to the red food:
   - There is a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
   - Therefore, the total discount for 3 baskets of red food is:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

4. Calculate the total cost of the red food after the discount:
   - Subtract the total discount from the total cost of the red food:
     \[
     54 - 6 = 48
     \]

5. Calculate the total cost of all the baskets:
   - Add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food:
     \[
     75 + 48 = 123
     \]

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. **First Year**: The town will build 12 homes.
2. **Second Year**: The town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. This is calculated as:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
   \]
3. **Third Year**: The town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes}
   \]
   Doubling this amount for the third year gives:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes}
   \]

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years**: Adding the homes built in each year:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables based on the given relationships:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- My brother's age is \( x + 3 \).
- My sister's age is \( x - 2 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 13 \]

Thus, I am 13 years old.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. Each of the 27 students needs 2 glue sticks:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to meet this demand. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks:

\[ \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we start with the initial volume of water passing through the river, which is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the volume doubles, so the volume on the second day is:

\[ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume increases by an additional 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total volume of water passing through the river on the third day is:

\[ 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we can model the spread of the infection using exponential growth. Initially, there are 10 infected people, and each infected person infects 6 others every day. This can be represented by the formula:

\[ I(n) = I(0) \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( I(n) \) is the number of infected people after \( n \) days,
- \( I(0) \) is the initial number of infected people,
- \( r \) is the rate of infection per day,
- \( n \) is the number of days.

In this scenario:
- \( I(0) = 10 \),
- \( r = 6 \) (since each infected person infects 6 others),
- \( n = 3 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ I(3) = 10 \times (1 + 6)^3 \]
\[ I(3) = 10 \times 7^3 \]
\[ I(3) = 10 \times 343 \]
\[ I(3) = 3430 \]

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is:

3430"
"To determine the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we start by calculating the amount Rafaela received. Given that each of the forty customers tipped her $20, we can calculate her total tips as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we calculate the amount Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total tips:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

1520"
"To solve the problem, we start with the total number of oranges Jennifer bought, which is 12. She then distributed these oranges among her children. Each of her three daughters received 2 oranges, and her only son received 3 oranges.

First, calculate the total number of oranges given to her daughters:
\[ 3 \text{ daughters} \times 2 \text{ oranges/daughter} = 6 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, add the number of oranges given to her son:
\[ 6 \text{ oranges} + 3 \text{ oranges} = 9 \text{ oranges} \]

Subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
\[ 12 \text{ oranges} - 9 \text{ oranges} = 3 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges each person earns in one year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number of badges Amber earns.

1. **Claire's Badge Earning:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earning:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges:**
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in one year is \(36 - 6 = 30\).

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.

We are given the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:

   \text{Total Cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the leftover money after buying the new rope:
   \[
   \text{Leftover Money} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Sarah will have \(\boxed{10}\) dollars left over after she buys the new rope."
"To determine in how many years Melanie's age will be three times her current age, we start by finding her current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find the number of years, \( x \), such that her age will be three times her current age. This can be expressed with the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Thus, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs of all the items:
     \[
     10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Remaining Budget:**
   - Kellyâ€™s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
     \[
     65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Kelly has \(\boxed{5}\) dollars left in her budget."
"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the total duration of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let \( x \) represent the length of her usual concerts in minutes. The equation for the final concert duration can be written as:
\[

"To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we start by calculating the number of microphones that do not fit into pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones do not find space, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

"To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Total petals for orchids = \( 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Total petals for daisies = \( 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \).

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals:
- Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
- Difference = \( 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To solve this problem, we start by establishing the relationships between the speeds of the different objects mentioned:

1. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
2. A whirligig spins five times the speed of a thingamabob.
3. The speed of a whatchamacallit is given as 121 meters per second.

First, let's determine the speed of a thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of a whatchamacallit}}{11} \]

Substituting the given speed of the whatchamacallit:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we use the speed of the thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig. Since a whirligig spins five times the speed of a thingamabob:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of a thingamabob} \]

Substituting the speed of the thingamabob:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we start by calculating the total distance driven:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Given that the car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can find the number of tune-ups needed by dividing the total distance by the interval for tune-ups:

\[ \text{Number of tune-ups} = \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he worked on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is:

"To determine the amount of allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the profit raised by the class from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   \[
   \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the problem step by step using the given information:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish:
   \[
   \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of rabbits} + \text{Number of fish} + \text{Number of gerbils}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of slices Abby and Josh consume together each day and then calculate how many days the loaf of bread will last.

1. Abby eats 2 slices per day.
2. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means he eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices per day.
3. Together, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

Given that the loaf of bread has 24 slices, we can find the number of days the loaf will last by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together each day:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Slices eaten per day}} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
\]

Thus, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

2. **Determine the number of berries per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect a total of 24 berries.
   - If he makes 2 trips, he must pick up \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which has 10,000 gallons. Therefore, the initial amount of water in the tank is:

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we determine the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Thus, the total amount of water used over 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Sum the total calories from both types of pastries.

First, let's calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = \(600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200\) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = \(450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150\) calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = \(200 \times 200 = 40,000\) calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = \(300 \times 150 = 45,000\) calories.

"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Next, we sum these values to find the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's break it down step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5):

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peterâ€™s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we start by calculating the individual requirements for the goats and the sheep.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**

"James buys 10 new CDs, each costing $15. The total cost before any discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

He gets a 40% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James then sells 5 of the CDs for $40. The amount he recovers from selling these CDs is:

\[ 40 \]

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he recovered from the amount he paid:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Therefore, the amount of money James was out is:

"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the initial swimming distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - Initial distance = \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time for the initial swimming:**
   - James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - Initial swimming time = \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swimming time.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - Remaining speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \text{ miles per hour} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).

6. **Calculate the time for the remaining swimming:**
   - Remaining swimming time = \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To determine the total commission Cayley earns, we need to calculate the commission from the sales of both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the given information and setting up the relationships between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna.

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
3. Marcus is half of Leoâ€™s age.

First, we calculate Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Marcus's age and Leo's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

Since Marcus is 21 years old:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

To find Leo's age, we solve for Leo's age:
\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Next, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides to isolate the term with \( B \):
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the given information: the book is 1.5 inches thick, and there are 100 pages per inch. Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes two pages to the total count.

First, calculate the total number of pages per inch:
\[ 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

Next, multiply this by the thickness of the book to find the total number of pages:
\[ 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

Thus, the book contains 150 pages.

"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to account for the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Calculate the total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total time from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate the time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time she woke up early is 5 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Total time subtracted = time spent sleepwalking + time woke up early
   - Total time subtracted = 23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes

5. **Calculate the total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time on the bed = total sleep time without interruptions - total time subtracted
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Given that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of patients admitted over a period of 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

We then find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"To determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \(X\) and \(S\) into the first equation to solve for \(A\).

First, substitute \(X = S + 5\) into the total equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \(S = 4A - 13\) into the equation \(A + 2S = 334\):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \(A = 40\) back into the equation \(S = 4A - 13\):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. Let's break down the journey step by step:

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister, and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother's age is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find her age, we calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years}

"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we determine how many boxes she gave away:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes she has left:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

The number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes after keeping 1/4:

\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

"To determine the total number of states in both India and the USA, we start by noting the number of states in the USA, which is 50. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. 

First, we calculate half the number of states in the USA:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we add 4 to this number to find the number of states in India:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]

Now, we add the number of states in both countries to find the total:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

The total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of cherries each person has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cherries Jerry has. The total number of cherries is 60, and we already know the number of cherries Robert and Richard have. Thus, the number of cherries Jerry has is:

\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has compared to Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. The difference is:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To determine the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the daily sunscreen usage:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours each day.
   - Therefore, her daily sunscreen usage is \( 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \).

2. **Calculate the total sunscreen usage over the 8 days:**
   - She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.
   - She is on vacation for 8 days.
   - Therefore, her total sunscreen usage is \( 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \).

3. **Determine the number of 8-ounce bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - She needs a total of 32 ounces.
   - Therefore, the number of bottles required is \( \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \).

Thus, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"To determine the total cost of both the red car and the blue car, we start by calculating the price of the red car, which is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

Given:
- The price of the blue car is $100.
- The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

First, calculate the discount on the red car:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

Next, subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow a series of steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant. Therefore, the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 111 feet long. The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   Pat already owns 17 flowers. The number of additional plants needed is:
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   Each plant costs $6. The total cost is:
   \[
   27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"To determine the total cost for Katherine to fill all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

1. **Cost of Petunias for One Basket:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias per basket.
   - Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. **Cost of Sweet Potato Vines for One Basket:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
   - Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. **Total Cost for One Basket:**
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. **Total Cost for All 5 Baskets:**

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then see how much soil remains for the roses.

1. Calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
   - Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   \[
   4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Calculate the soil used for the carnations:
   - Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   \[
   10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Calculate the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
   \[
   12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Determine the remaining soil:
   - They start with a 30-pound bag of soil.
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. Calculate the number of roses they can plant:
   - Each rose requires 1 pound of soil.

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first calculate the monthly savings allocated for shoes. Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly income for shoes:

\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

This means she saves $500.00 each month for shoes. Over the course of a year, her total savings for shoes will be:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year is:

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Thus, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve the problem of determining how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find the time required to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Rate of peeling}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sautÃ© 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find the time required to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine the number of batches needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per batch}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Time per batch} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both tasks is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To determine the final temperature change, we need to calculate the temperature changes at each stage of the air conditioner's operation and then sum these changes.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Next, we sum the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using mathematical reasoning:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check he writes:

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill checks**: Similarly, Buford writes 1 check per month for the gas bill. Therefore, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks per month to the church. Thus, he writes:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check per quarter for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
12 \text{ checks/year} + 12 \text{ checks/year} + 24 \text{ checks/year} + 4 \text{ checks/year} = 52 \text{ checks/year}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:
     \[
     F = 2 \times 44 = 88
     \]

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Thus, the number of flights to Greece is:
     \[
     \text{Flights to Greece} = \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66
     \]
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The number of remaining flights is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining flights} = 88 - 66 = 22
     \]
   - Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to each destination is:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{22}{2} = 11
     \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To determine Wilfred's age, we start by using the given information:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. With 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we start by defining the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices, in terms of \( x \), is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Thus, the total watermelon is \( 8x \).

Each adult receives a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, which translates to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, which translates to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Thus, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total costs incurred and then consider the context of the question to determine if it's asking for earnings or expenses. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Number of sessions per week**: 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month**: 4

First, calculate the total cost per session:
- Cost to rent the studio per session: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Total cost per week: $40 * 3 = $120

Then, calculate the total cost per month:
- Total cost per week: $120
- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total cost per month: $120 * 4 = $480

Since the question asks for the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, and it only provides cost information without any revenue data, the expected earnings would be the negative of the total cost (assuming no revenue is generated from the students).

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:

"To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow a series of mathematical steps:

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines is 50, and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of babies born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   \[
   \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. **Find the total population after a year:**
   The initial population is 50. Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:
   \[
   \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert cubic feet to gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.28}{(0.93)^3} = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
     \]
   - So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

2. **Charge After 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{0.348}{(0.91)^5} = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
     \]
   - So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   Janet works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. The prices are as follows:

- Peaches: $0.50 each
- Pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

Let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

- Cost of peaches: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- Cost of pears: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- Cost of kiwis: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- Cost of apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits already purchased:

\[
1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25
\]

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount is:

\[
10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75
\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

\[
\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3
\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of sweets Anne had initially. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces she gave away is the total number of pieces minus the pieces she kept:

\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

She distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend received:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the growth factor:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this growth factor to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To determine the total number of portraits and selfies, we start by calculating the number of pictures in each album. Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them equally across 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. We can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]
\[ \text{Total number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To find the total number of selfies and portraits combined, we add the two quantities:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Thus, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We are given:
- \( S = 4 \) dollars
- \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

   - With an iron pickaxe, the mining rate doubles: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the mining rate is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the daily mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total mining rate for 30 days:**
   - The daily rate for 40 dwarves is 1440 pounds.
   - Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the principle of proportionality. Given that the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich should be consistent across all package sizes.

First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the given packages:
- For the package with 2 sandwiches at $3, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the package with 4 sandwiches at $6, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the cost per sandwich is $1.5 for both packages, we can use this rate to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their respective probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: \(0.50\)

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\)
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: \(0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06\)

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: \(0.50\)
- Normal teacher gives an extension: \(0.20\)
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: \(0.06\)

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76\]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
\[1 - 0.76 = 0.24\]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of tickets each graduate can distribute to their friends and family. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. We need to account for the seats allocated to graduates and faculty, and then distribute the remaining seats equally among the graduates.

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family:
   \[
   \text{Total seats} = 6000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Seats for graduates} = 950
   \]
   \[
   \text{Seats for faculty} = 300
   \]
   \[
   \text{Seats for friends and family} = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750
   \]

2. Divide the number of seats for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give:
   \[
   \text{Number of tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{950} = 5
   \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given relationships between the sizes of the jelly beans:

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.

First, let's determine how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \]

Next, we convert the number of medium-sized beans to the number of small beans. Since 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean:
\[ 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans} \]

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains by placing the candy in each bottle. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop the candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we start by calculating the dimensions of the fabric required for each piece. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we find the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we calculate the total area required:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

The second person received \( x + 80 \).

The third person received twice what the second person received, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for the price of the car after \( t \) years, given an initial price \( P_0 \) and an annual depreciation rate \( r \), is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Given:
- Initial price \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- Annual depreciation rate \( r = 0.21 \)
- Time \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To determine the annual cost of insurance for James after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new monthly cost after the 60% increase.
2. Multiply the new monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the new monthly cost:
- The normal monthly cost is $120.
- The increase due to the accident is 60% of $120.

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance.

"To determine the number of laundry loads Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

1. **Weekly Laundry Calculation:**
   - Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king-size bed each week.
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

2. **Twin Sheets:**
   - Greg needs to wash 4 twin sets of sheets each week.
   - Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, the number of loads for twin sheets is:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
     \]

3. **King Sheets:**
   - Greg needs to wash 1 king set of sheets each week.
   - Since the machine can wash 1 king set at a time, the number of loads for king sheets is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
     \]

4. **Total Weekly Loads:**
   - Adding the loads for twin sheets and king sheets:
     \[
     2 \text{ loads for twin sheets} + 1 \text{ load for king sheets} = 3 \text{ loads per week}
     \]

5. **Yearly Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of loads in a year is:
     \[
     3 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks per year} = 156 \text{ loads per year}
     \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
156

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the times taken by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about the sequence of events and the final amount of meat left.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, the remaining meat was 270 kilograms.

2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate represents the other half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the velociraptors scavenged, the amount of meat was:
   \[
   270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex ate represents the other half of the triceratops. This means that the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was:
   \[
   540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. **Calculate the area of the north and south walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = \(10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}\).
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = \(2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}\).

2. **Calculate the area of the east and west walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = \(5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet}\).
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = \(2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}\).

3. **Calculate the total area of all four walls:**
   - Total area = \(160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet}\).

4. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = \(\frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons}\).

"To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances, as they are moving in opposite directions.

1. The first train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Now, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \)

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
- Total distance apart: \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \)

"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to account for the initial charge, the return, and the subsequent purchases with discounts.

1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. **Return**: She returned an item worth $15.00, so the balance after the return is:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Purchases**:
   - **Frying Pan**: The original price is $20.00, and it is on sale for 20% off. The discount amount is:
     \[
     20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
     \]
     Therefore, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
     \[
     20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
     \]

   - **Set of Towels**: The original price is $30.00, and it is on sale for 10% off. The discount amount is:

"To determine how much money Raymond has left, we need to follow the sequence of his financial transactions:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

Let's calculate the final amount step by step:

1. Initial amount: $21
2. After saving $11: $21 + $11 = $32
3. After spending $5 on a comic book: $32 - $5 = $27
4. After spending $19 on a puzzle: $27 - $19 = $8

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

"To determine the cost of each book, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount spent by Anna: 
   - Initial budget: $16
   - Remaining budget: $2
   - Total spent: $16 - $2 = $14

2. Subtract the amount already spent from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on the books:
   - Amount already spent: $4
   - Amount spent on books: $14 - $4 = $10

3. Since Anna bought 2 books at the same price, divide the total amount spent on books by 2 to find the cost of each book:
   - Cost per book: $10 / 2 = $5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

"To determine the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives at a speed of 70 miles per hour (mph) for 2 hours.
   - Using the formula for distance, \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \):
   \[
   \text{One-way distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the round trip distance:**
   - A round trip involves driving to his parents' house and back.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance is:
   \[
   \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance driven in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Thus, the total monthly distance is:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum the weights of all the dogs:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step using algebraic reasoning.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the Earth's circumference.

1. **Calculate half of the Earth's circumference:**
   The circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the Earth's circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days required:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. We know that Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

The relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages two years ago can be expressed as:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve the equation:

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step using algebraic reasoning.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Therefore, \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).

3. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - \( 2S + 12 = 30 \)
   - \( 2S = 18 \)
   - \( S = 9 \)

4. **Number of eggs Camden painted:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

6. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
   - Therefore, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).

7. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - \( 2A = 26 \)
   - \( A = 13 \)

8. **Number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process:

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound:

"To determine the total time Grandma spends on her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the problem into the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach.
   - She spends 40 minutes on the beach.
   - Therefore, her speed on the beach is \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Her speed on the sidewalk is \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).
   - She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach: 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes.
   - Total time: \(40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\).

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total amount Jane has saved over the past 8 weeks. Given that she saves $4 each week, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane continues to save $4 each week, we calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we start by translating the given information into a mathematical equation. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

where \( x \) is the number of marbles Bob currently has. Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we need to use the principle of weighted averages. The final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water can be calculated using the formula:

\[ T_f = \frac{m_1 \cdot T_1 + m_2 \cdot T_2}{m_1 + m_2} \]

where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces),
- \( T_1 \) is the temperature of the water from the first mug (33 degrees),
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce),
- \( T_2 \) is the temperature of the water from the second mug (unknown),
- \( T_f \) is the final temperature of the mixed water.

Given that Donny can only drink the water if it is at least 40 degrees, we set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{4 + 1} \geq 40 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:

\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

2. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans:
   \[
   \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
   \]
3. The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (\text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9

"To solve the problem, let's define the lengths of the ropes using algebra. Let \( B \) represent the length of the blue rope in centimeters. According to the problem:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the initial amounts of money that Ronnie and Rissa have. Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given three times as much, which is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we can use the concept of a geometric sequence. Each day, the number of cloud puffs doubles, starting with 3 puffs on Monday.

The number of puffs on each day can be represented as:
- Monday: \(3\)
- Tuesday: \(3 \times 2 = 6\)
- Wednesday: \(3 \times 2^2 = 12\)
- Thursday: \(3 \times 2^3 = 24\)
- Friday: \(3 \times 2^4 = 48\)

The total number of puffs counted over the five days is the sum of these terms:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

We can sum these values step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the special size box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

"To solve the problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach, applying basic arithmetic and financial calculations.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Daily Usage and Remaining Chalk:**
   - Each subsequent day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - The remaining chalk after each day is 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the Remaining Chalk for Each Subsequent Day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches (remaining after Monday).
   - \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

4. **Determine the Number of Days Before the Chalk is Less Than 2 Inches:**
   - After 1 day, the remaining chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days, the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"To solve the problem, let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we can expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we start by calculating the total number of books he can purchase with his budget of $27,000. Given that 100 books cost $500, we can find the cost per book:

\[
\text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Since Bob is distributing these books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[
\text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books}
\]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

"To determine how many apples Newton brought home, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first event) + 5 (from the second event) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (left from the previous step) + 6 (from the third event) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Let's count the total number of apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event.
- 5 apples from the second event.
- 6 apples from the third event.

Total apples in his pocket: 1 + 5 + 6 = 12

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To determine the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her 6 friends and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is:
  \[
  6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices/friend} = 36 \text{ slices}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is:
  \[
  6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices/friend} = 24 \text{ slices}
  \]

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizzas needed is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- The number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
  \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
\[
3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Production:**
   - The net number of snowballs Jay can make in one hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Time to Make 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of production:
   \[

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacherâ€™s lounge as \( x \).

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be expressed as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacherâ€™s lounge is \( 8 \).

"To determine the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - Given that one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish:**
   - After accounting for the fish with red stripes, the remaining fish are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - Given that \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Adding the fish with red stripes and the fish with blue stripes, we get:
   \[
   \text{Total fish with red stripes and blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
   \]

Thus, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Initial Count of Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy has 2 eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy also has 3 makeup sets, each with 6 colors:
     \[
     3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors initially is:
     \[
     8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **Colors Stolen by Her Sister:**
   - Her sister steals one of the palettes, which contains 4 colors:
     \[
     26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors}
     \]

3. **Colors Used Up from One Makeup Set:**
   - Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of 6 colors is:
     \[
     \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Subtract these 3 colors from the remaining total:
     \[
     22 - 3 = 19 \text{ colors}
     \]

Thus, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
19

     \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed from all settings:

Let \( M \) represent the number of paintings Samantha has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings: \( M = 27 \).

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Solving for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, given that 9 novels represent 3 quarters of that total.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

To isolate the number of novels this year, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. Given that his original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM) and he increases this by 2.5 times, we calculate his new speed as follows:

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages, with each page containing 450 words:

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"To determine the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then sum them up.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels.

Summing these amounts gives the total number of pieces of popcorn:

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim will need, we can break down the problem into two parts: the lemons needed for the pool party and the lemons needed for Allen's extra gallon.

1. **Lemons for the Pool Party:**
   - Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice needed for the pool party is:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice, the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}
     \]

2. **Lemons for Allen's Extra Gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the regular lemonade.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the number of lemons needed for 2 cups of lemon juice is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}
     \]

3. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - Adding the lemons needed for the pool party and Allen's extra gallon:
     \[
     24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}

"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we start by calculating the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then find the number of seeds in a large sunflower.

1. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, the number of seeds in a small sunflower is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds}
   \]

2. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we calculate 50% of 36 and add it to 36:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 36 = 0.5 \times 36 = 18
   \]
   \[
   36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds}
   \]

3. To find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:
   \[
   36 + 54 = 90
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:
90"
"Given that George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times as many pens as George, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:

"To determine the total amount Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The store offers a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price:
  \[
  8 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- For the second T-shirt, Jake pays 50% of the original price:
  \[
  8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Therefore, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
  \[
  8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

- The discount amount is:
  \[
  40 \times 0.4 = 16 \text{ dollars}

"Ryan's weekly allowance is $6, and he completed his chores for 3 weeks. Therefore, his total earnings are:
\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

He then bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, with each cone costing $1.25. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \, \text{cones} \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars/cone} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings, we get:
\[ 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of one ticket:
\[ \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}} = 2 \, \text{tickets} \]

Thus, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day, so:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he fills in 9 holes per day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

To find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, we calculate Aaron's speed:
- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

Next, we determine Vanessa's speed:
- Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
- Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:

"To solve the problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
