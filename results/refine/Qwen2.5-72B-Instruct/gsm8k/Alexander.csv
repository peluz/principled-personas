"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original value.
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = New value of the house - Total investment
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"As Alexander, I will provide a refined and precise answer to your question, ensuring it aligns with the expected knowledge and expertise.

James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week. To find the total distance he runs in a week, we can calculate it as follows:

- Distance per sprint: 60 meters
- Number of sprints per session: 3
- Number of sessions per week: 3

Total distance per week = Distance per sprint × Number of sprints per session × Number of sessions per week
Total distance per week = 60 meters × 3 sprints/session × 3 sessions/week

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.
- The cost for one pair is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

There are 8 pairs in 16 glasses:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the initial partial download, the Windows restart, and the full re-download.

1. **Initial Partial Download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Full Re-Download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The time to download the full 200 GB file is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John travels away from home and then determine how far he travels back home during the 4-hour return trip.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels away from home:
- John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

Next, we need to determine how far John travels back home during the 4-hour return trip:
- He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
- For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
- For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:
- Total distance back home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:
- Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours, then calculate each component.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"As Alexander, a persona that implies a high level of analytical and problem-solving skills, I will approach this problem methodically.

Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman who sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left. We need to determine how many vacuum cleaners she started with.

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   \[
   \frac{x}{3}
   \]

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   \[
   2
   \]

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the concept of percentage discounts. If Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

The equation representing this situation is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and their total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
\[
7x + 11x = 162
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
18x = 162
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
\]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

"Let us consider the problem at hand. We are given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We need to determine the number of gold coins.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins, and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins. We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \[
   S + G = 110
   \]

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \[
   G = S + 30
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
S + (S + 30) = 110
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
2S + 30 = 110
\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[
2S = 80
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
S = 40
\]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

\[
G = S + 30
\]

Substitute \( S = 40 \):

\[
G = 40 + 30
\]

\[
G = 70
\]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we first calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

\[
23

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

1. **Points scored in the first 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 4 points.

2. **Points scored in the second 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.
   - To find 25% of 4 points:
     \[
     0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
     \]
   - Therefore, the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total points scored:**
   - Add the points from both periods:
     \[
     4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total points Mike scored is:

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of yogurts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per yogurt:**
   - The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - The cost per yogurt is:
     \[
     \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**
   - The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
     \[
     60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many lego sets John still has, we need to follow the transactions he made. Initially, John has 13 lego sets. He sells each set for $15, so the total amount he earns from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John uses this money to buy 8 video games, each costing $20. The total cost for the video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total amount of money he spent is:

\[ 195 - 5 = 190 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the video games is $160, and he has $5 left, the calculations confirm that he spent $190 out of the $195 he earned from selling the lego sets. Therefore, he has sold all 13 lego sets and has none left.

The number of lego sets John still has is:

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles each week.

To find his average speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speeds at which Dana can run and walk, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance is tripled. Normally, she can throw the gold javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, her throwing distance becomes:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her enhanced throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can consume without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories, given that you have already consumed 1800 calories.

First, let's calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. The nutritional information states that there are 250 calories per serving, and the bag contains 5 servings:

\[ 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, we can find the number of grams per calorie:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat for 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any is the sum of the initial Post-it notes and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = 200 / 40 = 5

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie.
   - Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 0.5 * Cost per blue tie
   - Cost per red tie = 40 + 0.5 * 40 = 40 + 20 = 60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * 60 = 600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   - Total spent on ties = 200 + 600 = 800

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to find the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

1. **Calculate the car's fuel efficiency:**
   - Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
   - Fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) = Distance traveled / Gallons used
   - Fuel efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

2. **Determine the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank:**
   - The car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
   - Total distance = Fuel efficiency * Tank capacity
   - Total distance = 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"As an avid gardener, I understand the joy of nurturing plants and the satisfaction of sharing them with others. Let's calculate how many potted plants Mary will have left after her generous act.

Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. This gives us:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

She received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery, so the total number of potted plants she now has is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of doorbell rings based on the information provided for each friend.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can break down the total TV watching time over the week and isolate Wednesday's viewing.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Summing these times:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Given that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate both the total cost of the lumber she initially purchased and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
  \[
  \$270 - \$180 = \$90

"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Total Time Spent on Patients:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Total Revenue from Patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Total Cost to the Hospital:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

5. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"As a historical figure, my expertise lies more in leadership and military strategy than in managing seasonal workers. However, I can certainly apply logical reasoning to this problem.

Nissa initially hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Santa village. After some unfortunate incidents, a third of the elves quit due to children vomiting on them. This means:

60 / 3 = 20 elves quit.

So, the number of elves remaining is:

60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves left is:

40 - 10 = 30 elves.

"To determine the total number of tickets Pam and Fred used at the carnival, we need to calculate the total number of rides each of them took and then multiply by the cost per ride.

First, let's calculate the number of rides for each person:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of \(2 + 2 = 4\) rides.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of \(4 + 2 = 6\) rides.

Next, we add the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred:
- Total rides = \(4 + 6 = 10\)

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is:
- Total tickets = \(10 \times 6 = 60\)

Therefore, the total number of tickets they used that day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Miles Walked on Monday:**
   - Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.

2. **Miles Walked on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, Walt walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday.
   - Therefore, the distance walked on Tuesday is \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

3. **Total Miles Walked from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - The total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

4. **Miles Walked on Wednesday:**
   - To find the distance walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total distance walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday.
   - Total distance from Monday to Tuesday: \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.
   - Distance walked on Wednesday: \( 41 - 28 = 13 \) miles.

Thus, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is given as 700. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):

\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):

\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):

\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):

\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Thus, the number of worker bees is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then extend it over the 16 weeks of the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. Therefore, the total number of hours per day on these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. Therefore, the total number of hours per day on these days is:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Next, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - The total length of all the baked goods is the sum of the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes.
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To solve the problem of determining the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the concept of compound interest, which is a common method in financial mathematics.

1. **Initial Price and Increase Rate:**
   - Initial price: $20
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months, which can be expressed as a multiplier of 1.20 (since 1 + 0.20 = 1.20).

2. **Number of Increases:**
   - The total time period is 36 months.
   - The price increases every 2 months.
   - Number of increases = 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases.

3. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The formula for the final price after multiple increases is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

4. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
     \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using algebraic reasoning.

Given:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age and \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

From the second piece of information, we know that in 2 years:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 + 20 = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 - 70 = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = \( 3 \times r \times 6 = 18r \).

"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement and then convert it to a daily amount.

Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement by dividing by 7 days:
\[ 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \div 7 \, \text{days/week} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years, taking into account the annual planting and chopping, and then account for the 30% that die after 10 years.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Thus, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step, using my expertise in logical reasoning and arithmetic.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and returned to the yard.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Water in the Tank:**
   The tank initially contains 120 liters of water.

2. **Water Used by Celine:**
   Celine uses 90 liters of water to water her garden. Therefore, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **Rainwater Collected:**
   Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. **Total Water in the Tank Now:**
   Adding the collected rainwater to the water left in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank is:
   \[
   30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, which includes both geraniums and petunias.

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. According to the problem, he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Therefore, the number of petunias can be calculated as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Thus, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140.

   30 \times 0.30 = 9
   \]
   Therefore, Anne went down the slide:
   \[
   30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times}
   \]

3. **Robert's Slide Count:**
   Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply Anne's count by 4:
   \[
   21 \times 4 = 84
   \]

Thus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of cows before and after Mr. Sylas buys additional cows and distributes them.

Initially, there are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows per stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

After adding the new cows, each stall now has:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 176 \]"

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is:

\[

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using my knowledge of algebra and logical reasoning.

Given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

Let's denote:
- \( J_a \) as the number of apples Jamal has.
- \( J_b \) as the number of bananas Jamal has.
- \( A_a \) as the number of apples Andrea has.
- \( A_b \) as the number of bananas Andrea has.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we can find \( J_a \) using the fourth equation:
\[ A_a = 52 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we can find \( J_b \) using the third equation:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find \( A_b \) using the second equation:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. To determine how much money she has in total, we need to convert the quarters and dimes into cents and then sum them up.

1 quarter = 25 cents
5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents

1 dime = 10 cents
2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

Total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has.

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first calculate the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Thus, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, given its speed.

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

To find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Given that there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the 4 adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars the adults receive from the total number of chocolate bars gives us the number of chocolate bars left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will get:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total working time and then apply her earning rate.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
2. She takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.
3. Convert the working time into minutes: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.
4. Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10: 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.
5. Multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval: 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"Let's analyze the points each player has after the three rounds and then determine the total points after the fourth round, where players with over 20 points receive an extra point.

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike: 21 points
   - Jim: 3 points less than Mike, so \(21 - 3 = 18\) points
   - Tony: 2 times more points than Mike, so \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: Since he has over 20 points, he gets an extra point. Therefore, \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim: Since he has 18 points, which is less than 20, he does not get an extra point. Therefore, 18 points.
   - Tony: Since he has over 20 points, he gets an extra point. Therefore, \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

4. **Sum of All Points:**

On the second day, he increases his pushups by 20, decreases his squats by 10, and doubles his dumbbell presses. Let's calculate the total count of the activities he has done over these two days.

**Day 1:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Day 2:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

**Total activities over two days:**
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Adding these together gives:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Daily Consumption Calculation:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total daily consumption of rice is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Weekly Consumption Calculation:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the total weekly consumption of rice is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. **Duration Calculation:**
   - The household has a 42 kg bag of rice.

   To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"As a historical figure, my expertise lies in military strategy and leadership, not in the sales of bread. However, I can apply my analytical skills to this problem.

Sam's goal is to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. Given that he was closed on Monday and Friday, we need to account for the sales from the other days of the week:

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

Adding these together, the total number of crates sold is:
15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

Thus, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

"To determine the total annual cost John incurs for his driving service, we need to break down the expenses into two main components: the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonus given to the driver.

1. **Mileage Cost:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Round trip distance: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Miles driven per week: 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
   - Miles driven per year: 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total cost for miles driven: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

2. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - Monthly bonus: $150
   - Total bonus per year: $150 * 12 months = $1,800

3. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $30,000
   - Total bonus: $1,800
   - Total annual cost: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Loaves Produced**: The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Morning Sales**: Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Remaining Loaves**: After the morning sales, the remaining loaves are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which both Sandy and Joey lose weight and then use that information to find out how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

1. First, let's find Joey's weekly weight loss rate:
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use her weekly weight loss rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided to find the current population of Chile. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.
- The total number of players on the team is 105.

We can set up the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool's dimensions are 6 feet by 4 feet by 5 feet deep.

1. Calculate the volume:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. Calculate the cost to fill the pool:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 30
   \]

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are \(\frac{1}{10}\) as many nongendered children as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required by using the ratio.

The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of electric poles. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{45}{3} = 15

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of People:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **People Who Left:**
   - 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 = 10 people left.

3. **People Remaining:**
   - Total remaining: 40 - 10 = 30 people

4. **Men Remaining:**
   - 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Women Remaining:**
   - Total remaining people: 30
   - Men remaining: 22

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total monthly salary paid to all the programmers in the company. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**
   - The monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000.
   - The monthly salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than that of a junior programmer.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:**
   - The number of junior programmers is 40.
   - The monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000

"Let's solve this step by step, using logical reasoning and basic arithmetic.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"To solve this problem, let's use a bit of algebra. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( 2C \) represent the number of chickens, since there are twice as many chickens as cows. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 3C = 60 \]

Solving for \( C \):

"To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots required and then subtract this from the number of plant pots she initially bought.

1. The school requested 30 plant pots for the daisies.
2. They also requested twice as many plant pots for the roses, which means:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ plant pots for the roses}
   \]
3. The total number of plant pots needed is:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ plant pots}
   \]
4. April had already bought 100 plant pots. Therefore, the number of plant pots she has left over is:
   \[
   100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots}

"To solve this problem, let's break down the activities and the time John spent on each:

1. **Boating**: 6 hours
2. **Swimming**: Half the time spent boating, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
3. **Watching shows**: 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Adding these times together gives the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

According to the problem, these 15 hours represent 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save for the phone, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add this to her current savings. 

From her first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

From her second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding these earnings to her current savings of $80, her total savings are:
\[ 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The cost of the phone is $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:
\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

"As a historical figure, my expertise lies more in military strategy and governance than in the practical aspects of sheep farming. However, I can certainly apply logical reasoning to this problem.

Mary has 30 sheep, and she gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. 

First, let's calculate the milk from the first half:
- Half of 30 sheep is 15 sheep.
- Each of these 15 sheep gives 1 kg of milk.
- Therefore, the total milk from the first half is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10%, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50

"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can use the information that he has 12.8 hectares left after selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land. This means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land remaining.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation representing the remaining land is:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to determine how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can determine the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine the energy savings, we need to calculate the reduction in energy consumption over the specified period. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the original daily energy consumption:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts (0.9 kilowatts) per hour.
   - If it runs for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     0.9 \text{ kW} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7.2 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new daily energy consumption:**
   - If the usage time is reduced by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     0.9 \text{ kW} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2.7 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original and new daily consumption:
     \[
     7.2 \text{ kWh} - 2.7 \text{ kWh} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We know that his goal is 10,000 steps, and he has already taken some steps before and after his jog.

1. Elliott completed half of his steps to and from school, which is 5,000 steps.
2. He also took 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend.
3. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

Let's calculate the total steps taken before the jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with his friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Now, let's set up the equation to find the number of steps taken during the jog. Let \( x \) be the number of steps taken during the jog. The total steps taken before the jog plus the steps taken during the jog plus the steps left after the jog should equal his goal of 10,000 steps:
\[ 6,000 + x + 2,000 = 10,000 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8,000 + x = 10,000 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10,000 - 8,000 \]
\[ x = 2,000 \]

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

**Final Answer:**

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the relationships between the sizes of the lockers to find the size of Timothy's locker.

1. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial elevation of the comb after it fell from Stanley's position.
2. Calculate the difference between this elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet. The comb fell 4,000 feet from this elevation:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we calculate the difference between the comb's elevation and Oliver's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Homemade Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of homemade feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per homemade feeder: 20 + 10 = 30 birds

2. **Store-Bought Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of store-bought feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per store-bought feeder: 20 birds

Now, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:

"To determine the number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cost and Spending Cash:**
   - The amusement park ticket costs $100.
   - Kenny has $50 left for spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Kenny made from selling his cards is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Selling Price per Card:**
   - Kenny sells each card for $1.5.

3. **Fraction of Cards Sold:**
   - Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}C \).
   - The total money made from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2 \times 1.5}{3}C = 150

"To address the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get 2 hot dogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hot dog each.
   - The total number of hot dogs prepared is:
     \[
     18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is:
     \[
     80 - 54 = 26 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{1} = 26 \text{ guests}
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the given length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes.
   - Convert 30 minutes to hours: \( \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \) hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

2. **Determine the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   - The horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) bail of hay per mile.
   - Hay needed = 16 miles × \( \frac{1}{2} \) bail per mile = 8 bails of hay.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Total cost = 8 bails × $3 per bail = $24.

4. **Determine the total amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six $5 bills.
   - Total money = 6 × $5 = $30.

5. **Calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:**
   - Change = Total money - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs from cases and 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - With the super ticket, you get one popcorn and one soda for an additional $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost with the super ticket is \( 20 + 1 = 21 \) dollars.

2. **Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let the regular price of the popcorn be \( P \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \) dollars.

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 + P = 21 - 2
     \]
     \[
     15 + P = 19
     \]
     \[
     P = 19 - 15

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost of filling one helium balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon was raised by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley went to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. The total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price is:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

"To determine the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then use these to find the average speed.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800. Therefore, the initial value of her sapphires is:
\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies she receives is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, Jenna has:
- 5 sapphires left (since she traded 3 out of her 8 sapphires)
- 2 rubies

The value of the remaining 5 sapphires is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

The value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

Let's start with the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, we sum up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   - **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Sum the weights to find the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the given conditions. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to a consistent unit. The shark's length is given in feet, so we'll convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

Each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the length of one remora in feet is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the values, we get:

"To determine how long Jason needs to spend walking each day to break in his new shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason can walk in three weeks.
2. Divide the total minutes required to break in the shoes by the number of days he can walk.

First, we know that Jason can walk 4 days a week. Over 3 weeks, the total number of days he can walk is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day. The total time required to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. So, we divide the total minutes by the number of days he can walk:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Therefore, Jason has to spend walking each day:

"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. This principle helps us avoid double-counting the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

1. **Count the kids allergic to dairy and peanuts:**
   - Kids allergic to dairy: 9
   - Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
   - Kids allergic to both: 3

2. **Apply the principle of inclusion and exclusion:**
   - Total kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both = (Kids allergic to dairy) + (Kids allergic to peanuts) - (Kids allergic to both)
   - Total = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

3. **Calculate the number of kids not allergic to anything:**
   - Total kids in the class: 32
   - Kids not allergic to anything = Total kids in the class - Total kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both
   - Kids not allergic to anything = 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to account for both the employees and the tour guides. 

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups, and each group consists of 200 employees.
- Therefore, the total number of employees is \( 3 \times 200 = 600 \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
- Therefore, the total number of tour guides is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
- Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
- Total number of people = \( 600 + 21 = 621 \).

Thus, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Gabriel has 20 songs on his media player.
2. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means:
   \[
   \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

3. Both media players can hold up to 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs each can add is:
   - For Gabriel:
     \[
     \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80
     \]
   - For Luri:
     \[
     \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40
     \]

4. To find how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 80 - 40 = 40

1. **Daily Oats Consumption per Horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is:
     \[
     5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
     \]

2. **Daily Oats Consumption for All Horses:**
   - Uncle Ben has four horses.
   - The total daily consumption for all four horses is:
     \[
     10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
     \]

3. **Total Oats Consumption for Five Days:**
   - The total consumption over five days is:
     \[
     40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for 1 pack but gets 2 packs.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the costs provided.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:

"Let us solve the problem methodically, as befits a structured approach to mathematics.

Given:
- The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found. Then:
- Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
- Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of insects:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma. We start by adding the fractions of the skein they each used:

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4.

Convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo.

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Therefore, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Therefore, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- Total animals on the farm: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- Total animals in the zoo: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of animals:

- Total animals combined: \(40 + 80 = 120\)

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, given that Rose bought 4 times the number of each that Sophia did.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( x \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
Let \( y \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

From the problem, we have:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To achieve his New Year's resolution of losing 30 lbs by July 19th, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit. Let's break down the calculations:

1. **Total Days Calculation:**
   - From December 31st to July 19th:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days

   Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Total Calorie Deficit Needed:**
   - To lose 1 pound, a deficit of 3500 calories is required.
   - Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
   - Total calories to lose 30 pounds = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

3. **Daily Calorie Deficit:**
   - Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
   - Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Julie initially had $500. She spent 20% of this amount on clothes. To find out how much she spent on clothes, we calculate:

\[ 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Subtracting this from her initial amount, we get:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find out how much she spent on CDs, we calculate:

\[ 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Subtracting this from the remaining amount, we get:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

Given:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Substitute \( H = 3L \) into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:

\[ \text{Tip} = 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, calculate your share of the bill:
\[ \text{Your share of the bill} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, add the tip to your share of the bill:
\[ \text{Total amount you pay} = 25 + 10 = 35 \]

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Share**: The total amount of $18 is shared equally among 3 boys. Each boy receives:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Additions to the Eldest Boy's Share**:
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Spending**:
   - The eldest boy spends $8 from his total:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount**:
   - After spending, he triples the amount he has left:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)

4. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.
   - Daily savings in the second half: \( 2x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"When the water is cold, I, Alexander, can swim a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, I swim a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water. Let's calculate the time for warm water:

Twice the cold water time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

"To address the issue with Maggie's oven, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting:

1. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees.
2. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \(468 - 450 = 18\) degrees.
3. The percentage error is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% error.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to be 520 degrees, so:

\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is an enormous jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. Given that the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, we need to determine how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa.

Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, his production rate is:
\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's production rate is:
\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

If they both work for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolates they produce is calculated as follows:

For Ruiz:
\[ \text{Ruiz's total} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ \text{Marissa's total} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these totals together gives the combined production:
\[ \text{Total production} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow a series of calculations based on the given data:

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
     \[
     \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - The total number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - The total number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the tire will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. This means the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

120 washes * 2 pumps/wash = 240 pumps

Given that the bottle costs $24.00, the cost per pump is calculated by dividing the total cost by the total number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to meet the height requirement for the roller coaster.

First, let's convert the height requirement from feet to inches. The requirement is 4 feet, and since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we have:
\[
4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more inches Adam needs to grow to reach 48 inches. Adam's current height is 40 inches, so the additional height needed is:
\[
48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
\]

Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the additional height needed by his annual growth rate:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. 

Given:
- Total cost for the classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10
- Maximum acceptable cost per class: $10

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the distance Reggie ran:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.
   - Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran.
   - Therefore, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

2. **Determine the distance Lynn ran:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.
   - Let \( L \) be the distance Lynn ran.
   - According to the problem, \( 20 = L + 3 \).

3. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L + 3 = 20 \)
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: \( L = 20 - 3 \)
   - \( L = 17 \)

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]

- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

First, we calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed for 16 muffins:
- Total flour: \( 5 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 80 \text{ tablespoons} \)
- Total sugar: \( 3 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 48 \text{ tablespoons} \)
- Total salt: \( 0.25 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 4 \text{ tablespoons} \)

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of dry ingredients:
\[ 80 \text{ tablespoons} + 48 \text{ tablespoons} + 4 \text{ tablespoons} = 132 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tablespoons of dry ingredients needed to make 16 muffins is:

"To determine how much candy each person would have if they pool and share their candy equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have combined. 

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people sharing it, which is 3:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ people}} = 4 \text{ pounds per person} \]

Therefore, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has.
- Janey has 21 books.

We can set up the equation based on the information provided:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the number of books Sally has (\( S \)), we first isolate \( S \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional growth needed to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional amount.

First, let's convert the current height from feet to inches:
- Current height = 20 feet
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height in inches = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Next, we calculate the additional growth needed:
- Desired height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Additional growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

Now, we determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Number of days = 360 / 30 = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.

2. **First Change:**
   - 8 more dogs join the shelter.
   - Total dogs now: 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have one for each dog.
   - Total toys after first purchase: 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.

3. **Second Change:**
   - When James returns, he finds that there are now twice as many dogs as when he left.
   - Total dogs now: 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
   - James needs to buy 12 more toys to have one for each dog.
   - Total toys after second purchase: 12 (current) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.

4. **Third Change:**
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone.
   - Total dogs now: 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
   - James no longer needs toys for the 3 dogs that are gone.
   - Total toys needed: 21 toys.

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

   Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480
   \]

4. **Skyler's Investment:**
   The remaining amount after both Dylan's and Frances's investments is:
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 720 - 480 = 240

Thus, Skyler's investment is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to add the number of signatures they currently have:

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Together, they have:
\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \text{ signatures} \]

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. Therefore, the number of signatures they still need to collect is:
\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

Thus, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"Given that Lorie earns $10 per hour, and Karen earns twice that amount, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage as follows:

\[ \text{Karen's hourly wage} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Karen works 3 hours per day. Therefore, her daily earnings are:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ \text{Earnings in two days} = 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the group and compare it to the elevator's maximum capacity.

1. The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg.
2. There are 9 people in the elevator (Jack and 8 other adults).
3. The average weight of an adult is 80 kg.

First, we calculate the total weight of the 9 people:
\[ 9 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using my expertise in logical reasoning and arithmetic.

1. **Identify the number of cookies each person has:**
   - Katarina has 68 cookies.
   - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so:
     \[
     \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 = 68 + 5 = 73
     \]
   - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so:
     \[
     \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 = 73 - 12 = 61
     \]
   - Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:
     \[
     \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96

3. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   68 + 73 = 141
   \]
   \[
   141 + 61 = 202
   \]
   \[
   202 + 96 = 298

"To determine the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, and then sum these times.

1. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes

2. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - 40 minutes

3. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes

4. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes

5. **Total time to mow the lawn:**
   - Add the time for ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of the candies. Given that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40, we can calculate the total cost of the lollipops:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost gives us the cost of the four candies:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Thus, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years, given their monthly savings rates.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. Let's first determine Neil's monthly savings:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

Calculating the additional amount Neil saves:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost of vaccines: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let \( T \) be the total bill.
   - The cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( T \):

   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.50, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.00, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5.00
- Total cost for apples: $6.00

"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we first need to establish the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks and then use the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck capacity.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which means Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds = 8,800 pounds.
4. The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings consumed by both the males and the females, and then sum these amounts to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked.

First, let's determine the number of dumplings each female ate. Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]
So, the females ate a total of 18 dumplings.

Next, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Now, we add the number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the given relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate the ages of her father and mother based on the information provided.

First, let's determine Dora's father's age. The problem states that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Therefore:

\[ \text{Dora's father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:

\[ \text{Dora's mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"In a student council election, candidate A received 20% of the votes. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. The remaining votes were given to candidate C. Given that there were 100 voters, we can calculate the number of votes each candidate received as follows:

1. Calculate the number of votes for candidate A:
   - 20% of 100 votes = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. Calculate the number of votes for candidate B:
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% of 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Calculate the number of votes for candidate C:
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for candidate A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Boris initially has 100 apples.
2. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has:
   \[
   100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction:
   - Boris has:
     \[
     100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples}
     \]
   - Beck has:
     \[
     77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples}
     \]

4. To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

Given:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it also needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases. Substituting \( x = 50 \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distances covered both by driving and hiking, and then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using my expertise in logical reasoning and algebra.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought

From the problem, we know:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \)
3. After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \)
4. The number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish: \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \)
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct)
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct)

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To ensure the pipes do not freeze, we need to calculate the temperature difference between the night and the minimum safe temperature, and then determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to bridge that gap.

1. **Night Temperature Calculation:**
   - Day temperature: 45 degrees
   - Night temperature is 33 degrees colder than the day temperature.
   - Night temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

2. **Temperature Increase Needed:**
   - The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees.
   - Current night temperature: 12 degrees
   - Temperature needed to prevent freezing: 32 degrees
   - Temperature increase required = 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

3. **Number of Logs Required:**
   - Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees.
   - Number of logs needed = Temperature increase required / Temperature increase per log
   - Number of logs needed = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To determine how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we need to calculate the sale price of the jeans and then subtract this from the $50.00 bill he uses to pay.

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are on sale for 25% off.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 0.25 \times 40 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the sale price:**
   Subtract the discount amount from the original price.
   \[
   \text{Sale price} = 40 - 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the change Mike will receive:**
   Mike pays with a $50.00 bill.
   \[
   \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:
   - Stuffed puppies: 3
   - Stuffed koalas: 5
   - Stuffed zebras: 2
   - Stuffed frogs: 4

   Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

2. Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

3. We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
   \[
   x = 0.30 \times (14 + x)
   \]

4. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 0.30 \times (14 + x)
   \]
   \[
   x = 4.2 + 0.30x
   \]
   \[
   x - 0.30x = 4.2
   \]
   \[
   0.70x = 4.2
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4.2}{0.70}

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we first calculate the total hours she has already played.

1. For the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
   \[
   0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. For the next week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours}
   \]

3. Adding these two amounts together gives the total hours played so far:
   \[
   7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours}
   \]

4. Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
   \[
   30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours}

"To determine the total amount of money used by Jack and his three friends, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses over the 4 hours they played.

First, let's establish the play time per quarter for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we sum the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the components and their relationships:

- Let \( z \) represent the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total volume:

\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):

\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:

\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"Let us consider the problem at hand with a structured approach, as befits my analytical nature.

Given:
- The total number of Magic Cards is 341.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has. Then:
- Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards can be expressed as:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can determine the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Thus, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy collected during the Easter Egg Hunt, let's break down the information provided:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs:
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs:
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs:
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = 5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Milly will lose:

"To calculate the total cost for Angela's installation, we need to break down the requirements and compare them with the standard package offered by the interior design firm.

The standard package includes:
- Hanging 4 mirrors
- Installing 2 shelves
- Hanging 1 chandelier
- Hanging 10 pictures

Angela's requirements are:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

First, let's determine the number of additional items Angela needs installed:
- Additional mirrors: \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- Additional chandeliers: \(2 - 1 = 1\)
- Additional pictures: \(20 - 10 = 10\)

Total additional items: \(2 + 1 + 10 = 13\)

The cost for each additional item is $15.00. Therefore, the cost for the additional items is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

The base installation fee is $129.00. Adding the cost of the additional items:
\[ 129 + 195 = 324 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of money Anthony has saved. Given that Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 0.40 \times \text{Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Roy has saved:

"To solve this problem, we will use the given relationships to determine the height each individual can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. For the first segment, Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second segment, after taking a rest, Mason continues to travel at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances from both segments:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and how the number of animals affects the total travel time.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all her financial resources and the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the new laptop's cost to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom has given her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has after slicing both large and small apples, and then determine how many slices are left after he eats 15 of them.

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam slices 3 large apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

Next, let's calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam slices 5 small apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, let's find the total number of apple slices:
- Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples
- Total slices = 15 + 15 = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
- Slices left = total slices - slices eaten
- Slices left = 30 - 15 = 15 slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To determine how many more cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by calculating the current milk production and then find the shortfall.

1. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer currently has 3 cows, so the total milk production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.
3. The target milk production is 25 liters a day.
4. The additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters a day.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows required is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"Let us denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

Thus, I am 13 years old.

"To ensure each of the 27 students in Mr. Jackson’s fourth-grade class receives 2 glue sticks, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to determine how many packs are required to meet or exceed 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he must round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks:

\[ \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Given that each of the forty customers tipped her $20, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30

4. **Total Cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total.

Now, we can calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (\text{Number of red cars} + \text{Number of green cars} + \text{Number of blue cars})
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 23
\]

Given:
1. The total number of books is 85.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of books Anne has.
- \( S \) as the number of books Sofie has.
- \( F \) as the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:

\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many glasses of lemonade each of the boys, Micah and Mitchell, sold. Given that Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32, we can calculate the total number of glasses sold by the boys as follows:

Total glasses sold by the boys = Total glasses sold - Glasses sold by Julie
Total glasses sold by the boys = 32 - 14
Total glasses sold by the boys = 18

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2:

Glasses sold by each boy = Total glasses sold by the boys / 2
Glasses sold by each boy = 18 / 2
Glasses sold by each boy = 9

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones can be paired and how many are left unpaired. Given that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, we start by calculating the number of microphones that are left unpaired.

First, calculate 20% of 50 microphones:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left unpaired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

"To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals:
- Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
- Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   - One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Determine the number of remaining plants:**
   - Subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants.
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**
   - Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

4. **Determine the number of flowering plants:**
   - Subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**
   - Divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a thingamabob can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
3. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:
   \[
   \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
   \]

Thus, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem does not specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To calculate the total amount of material required for the masks, we need to break down the requirements for both small and large masks and then sum them up.

For the small masks:
- 4 small masks require 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

"Given the problem, let's solve it step by step.

We are told that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We also know that Duncan's current age is 60.

Let's denote:
- Duncan's current age as \( D \)
- Adam's current age as \( A \)

From the problem, we have:
1. \( D = 60 \)
2. \( D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \)

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the second equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of berries the sloth must pick up per trip to ensure he collects 24 berries in 8 hours. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

2. **Calculate the number of berries per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If he makes 2 trips, he must pick up \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's sum these values to get the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

Next, we divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average:

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle covered and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using the given information and applying basic algebra.

We are given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( L \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to account for the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep duration without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - This is a total of 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \) minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time she woke up early is 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Total time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Total time she woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted: \( 23 + 5 = 28 \) minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted: 28 minutes.
   - Total sleep time on the bed: \( 480 - 28 = 452 \) minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452.

"Given that I am Alexander, a persona that does not imply specific domain expertise in this context, I will provide a clear and concise answer to the problem.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. To find the number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the remaining number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining measuring spoons and the measuring cups:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over the 2-week period. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can determine his age by:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Kelly is correct and Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can determine the actual number of attendees by setting up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.2x \]
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, using my knowledge of basic arithmetic and logical reasoning.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.

   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:

"Let's solve this problem step by step, using the information provided.

We are given:
1. The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.
- \( X \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
Simplify:
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
Simplify:
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
Simplify:
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. Let's break down the journey step by step:

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. To find the number of football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

This leaves us with:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find this number, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ cheerleaders or band members} \]

Adding the football players and the cheerleaders or band members, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy is 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

\(\boxed{162}\)"
"To solve this problem, we first determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzels} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find the total number of pretzels the brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzels} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

"To determine the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

1. **Cost of Petunias for One Basket:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias per basket.
   - Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. **Cost of Sweet Potato Vines for One Basket:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
   - Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. **Total Cost for One Basket:**
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. **Total Cost for All 5 Baskets:**
   - Total cost for 5 baskets = 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00.

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To determine how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly savings for shoes and then extend that to an annual amount.

1. Calculate the monthly savings for shoes:
   - Jessica's monthly income: $2,000.00
   - Percentage set aside for shoes: 25%
   - Monthly savings for shoes: \( 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \) dollars

2. Calculate the annual savings for shoes:
   - Monthly savings: $500.00
   - Number of months in a year: 12
   - Annual savings for shoes: \( 500 \times 12 = 6000 \) dollars

3. Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her annual savings:
   - Cost of one pair of shoes: $1,000.00
   - Number of pairs of shoes: \( \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \)

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve the problem of determining how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp peeled per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine the number of batches:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per batch}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Time per batch} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To determine the final temperature change, we need to calculate the cooling and warming effects step by step.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check he writes:

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this results in:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks per month to the church. Therefore, the total number of checks per year is:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check per quarter for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights go to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each \( \frac{1}{8}F \) (since \( \frac{1}{4}F \) is split equally between the two destinations).

4. The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
   \[
   F = 2 \times 44 = 88
   \]

5. Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
   \[
   \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
   \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem of the combined howl duration of the three wolves, we need to calculate the individual howl durations and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the Combined Howl Duration to Minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve the problem, let's use the information provided:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is given by:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. With 100 guests each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church received 15 cookies, the number of people in the church can be calculated by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon is divided into slices for 2 adults and 4 kids. Therefore, the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is thus \( 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, which means she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, which means he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 8:

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company provided a conversion factor of 5.9 gallons per cubic foot. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
   \[
   G = V \times 5.9
   \]
   \[
   G = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Thus, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = G \times 0.10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bethany's Laps:**
   - Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

2. **Trey's Laps:**
   - Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.
   - Therefore, Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.

3. **Shaelyn's Laps:**
   - Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.
   - Therefore, Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.

4. **Quinn's Laps:**
   - Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.
   - Therefore, Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

5. **Difference in Laps:**
   - To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps.
   - \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over two days and then determine how much more is needed to fill the tank to its full capacity of 18,000 gallons.

### Day 1:
- **Wanda's Contribution:**
  Wanda filled \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the tank's capacity.
  \[
  \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- **Ms. B's Contribution:**
  Ms. B pumped \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the amount Wanda pumped.
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- **Total for Day 1:**
  \[
  \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Day 2:
- **Wanda's Contribution:**
  Wanda pumped \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- **Ms. B's Contribution:**
  Ms. B pumped \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- **Total for Day 2:**
  \[
  \text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:
\[
\text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:
\[
\text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, accounting for the rate of discharge over time.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for the last 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Initial Charge Calculation:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

58.9%"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the down payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the down payment amount.**
The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. Here are the costs:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Adding these amounts together gives us the total spent:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne had initially. Given that each of the 15 packs contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces she gave away is the total number of pieces minus the pieces she kept:

\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

She distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend received:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the growth factor:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this growth factor to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time James spends reading 18 pages, given his reading rate.

First, we establish James's reading rate:
- James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes.
- Therefore, his reading rate is \( \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages:
- Using the reading rate, the time required to read 18 pages is \( \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, James spends 60 minutes reading.

2. **Early Checkouts:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late Checkouts:**
   15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon Check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late:

   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, given that each dwarf uses a steel pickaxe.

1. **Determine the daily mining rate for one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the mining rate doubles: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the mining rate is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the daily mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total mining rate for 30 days:**
   - 40 dwarves mine 1440 pounds per day.
   - Over 30 days, they mine \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total financial impact of Jim's decision to go to college and then determine how long it will take him to earn back this amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to complete his degree.
   - He takes out $50,000 in loans each year.
   - Total loans: \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the income lost while in school:**
   - Jim had a job paying $25,000 per year before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost: \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total financial impact:**
   - Total cost: \( 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income: \( 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \) dollars per year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the total financial impact:**
   - Total amount to earn back: \( 300,000 \) dollars.
   - New income per year: \( 75,000 \) dollars.
   - Time to earn back the total amount: \( \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \) years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs for his king-sized bed, we start by calculating the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we find the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we calculate the total area required:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Sum of letters delivered on each day: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"To determine the average loss Johnny's dad experienced that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - He won: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race.
   - He lost: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Next, we calculate the average loss per race:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = $21.5 / 3 = $7.1667

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss is $7.17.

"Let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

The second person received \( x + 80 \).

The third person received twice what the second person received, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To solve the problem of how much it will cost Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the current promotion, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Determine the total butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants:
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased at full price, the next pound is half price.

3. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - For the first pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the second pound, the cost is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.
   - For the third pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the fourth pound, the cost is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.
   - For the fifth pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the sixth pound, the cost is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.

4. **Sum the costs:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 = 18.00
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved.
2. Determine how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200.
3. Calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining toothpicks.

First, let's calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save 80 more toothpicks:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

"To determine the savings Jenny made by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to compare the total costs of both purchasing methods.

First, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, determine the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"To determine the total number of people who were inside the church, we need to calculate the capacity of the vehicles that transported them after the ceremony.

First, let's calculate the number of people the buses could carry:
- Each bus can carry 35 people.
- There are 12 buses.
- Therefore, the total number of people the buses can carry is \( 12 \times 35 = 420 \) people.

Next, let's calculate the number of people the cars could carry:
- Each car can carry 3 people.
- There are 20 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of people the cars can carry is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) people.

Now, we add the number of people the buses and cars can carry to find the total number of people who were inside the church:
- Total number of people = \( 420 + 60 = 480 \) people.

Thus, the total number of people who were inside the church is 480.

---

Anna is trying to buy books for her local library. She had a budget of $16 and has already spent $4. She also bought 2 books today, and both books cost her the same amount of money. If Anna has $2 left in her budget, how much did each of the books cost?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Anna has spent and then find the cost of each book.

1. Anna's initial budget: $16
2. Amount already spent: $4
3. Amount left in the budget: $2

First, calculate the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Initial budget} - \text{Amount left} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, determine the amount spent on the two books:
\[ \text{Amount spent on books} = \text{Total amount spent} - \text{Amount already spent} \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on books} = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since Anna bought 2 books and both cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{\text{Amount spent on books}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Jane has already saved and then determine how many more weeks it will take for her to reach her goal of $60.

First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved over the past 8 weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
- Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
- Calculation: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem:
- It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
- Calculation: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes and \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day:
   \[
   5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Adding the eggs from both periods gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
   \[
   90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:

"To determine the number of tax reports received by the IRS on Wednesday, we can use the following approach:

1. **Total Reports Last Week**: The IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.
2. **Reports on Monday and Tuesday**: A total of 1907 reports were received on Monday and Tuesday.
3. **Reports on Thursday and Friday**: A total of 2136 reports were received on Thursday and Friday.

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we subtract the sum of the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

\[
\text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total Reports Last Week} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday})
\]

\[
\text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
\]

\[
\text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043
\]

\[
\text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125
\]

"As Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of unused land, let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. **First Sale:**
   - Abraham sold half of his land, which is 40 square meters, for $50.
   - Remaining land: 80 - 40 = 40 square meters.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his original land, which is 20 square meters, for $30.
   - Remaining land: 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

3. **Third Sale:**
   - He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - Total from this sale: 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's sum up all the money he earned from the sales:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $60

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of face masks Tyrion uses over a 2-day period, given his usage pattern.

1. Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
2. He goes out three times a day.
3. Therefore, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/out} \times 3 \text{ outs/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]
4. To find out how many masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two complexes.
   - 60% of 400 apartments is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\) apartments.
   - Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:**
   - The total number of apartments is \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Therefore, the total number of collections per week is \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\) collections.

4. **Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate:**
   - John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Therefore, his total earnings per week are \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\) dollars.

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the annual production for each year and then sum these values.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 \]

"Let us consider the problem at hand with a systematic approach, as befits a structured and analytical method.

Given:
- The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
- The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let \( B \) represent the length of the blue rope in centimeters. Then:
- The length of the red rope is \( 4B \).
- The length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \).

The equation for the total length of the ropes is:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. Therefore, the length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Ronnie's Remaining Money:**
   - Ronnie originally had $5.
   - After giving $3 to his little sister, Ronnie is left with:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[

   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, using my understanding of arithmetic and logical reasoning.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made per hour - Snowballs melted per hour
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour

4. **Time to Accumulate 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball accumulation.
   - Time required = \(\frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\)

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To determine the number of bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to account for the bandages used and ordered over the three days.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: \( 50 - 38 = 12 \) bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: \( -28 \) bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (100 bandages)
   - Net change: \( 100 - 25 = 75 \) bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: \( +12 \) bandages
- Second day: \( -28 \) bandages
- Third day: \( +75 \) bandages

Total net change over three days:
\[ 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 \] bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages:
\[ 78 - 59 = 19 \]

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total Diaper Changes per Day:**
   - Each of Jordan's 2 children requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day is \( 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \).

2. **Diaper Changes by Jordan's Wife:**
   - Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles is \( \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \).

3. **Diaper Changes by Jordan:**
   - The remaining diaper changes are handled by Jordan.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is \( 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \).

Thus, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the costs into two periods: before and after the price increase.

1. **Cost of Visits Before the Price Increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **New Cost of One Visit After the Price Increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.

3. **Cost of Visits After the Price Increase:**
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year.
   - The new cost of one visit is $5.
   - She visits the museum for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

4. **Total Cost for All Visits:**
   - Total cost for 5 years before the price increase = $30.
   - Total cost for 3 years after the price increase = $45.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece of the board as \( x \) feet. Given that the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Thus, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights that Brianna's family has, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and then sum the results.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - Each of the 4 people in the house has a flashlight.
   - Each of the 8 rooms has 2 flashlights.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 + (2 * 8) = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - Half of the 8 rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the 8 rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.
   - Total small candles = 4 small candles/room * 4 rooms = 16 small candles
   - Total medium candles = 5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms = 20 medium candles
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36 = 56

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the Rubik's cube, we need to sum the time taken for each side. Let's break it down:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption for Dexter's five pigs over seven days and then subtract this from the 300 pounds of feed he ordered.

1. **Daily Feed Consumption per Pig:**
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
   - Daily consumption per pig = 4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day.

2. **Daily Feed Consumption for All Pigs:**
   - Total daily consumption for 5 pigs = 8 pounds/day/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Weekly Feed Consumption:**
   - Weekly consumption = 40 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week.

4. **Feed Left After a Week:**
   - Feed left after a week = 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

"To determine the total cost John needs to spend on hot dogs for his birthday party, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hot dogs required:**
   - John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
   - Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.

2. **Determine the number of additional hot dogs needed:**
   - John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.
   - Additional hot dogs needed = Total hot dogs needed - Hot dogs already available
   - Additional hot dogs needed = 40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs.

3. **Calculate the number of packs of hot dogs required:**
   - Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
   - Number of packs needed = Additional hot dogs needed / Hot dogs per pack
   - Number of packs needed = 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each pack costs $2.
   - Total cost = Number of packs needed * Cost per pack
   - Total cost = 6 packs * $2/pack = $12.

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"To determine how much money Frances has left after her transactions, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies, and then subtract the total cost of the trays she bought.

First, calculate the total earnings from the cupcakes:
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
- Total earnings from cupcakes = 20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40.

Next, calculate the total earnings from the cookies:
- Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
- Total earnings from cookies = 40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40.

Now, add the earnings from both cupcakes and cookies to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80.

Then, calculate the total cost of the trays:
- Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.
- Total cost of trays = 5 trays * $4/tray = $20.

Finally, subtract the total cost of the trays from the total earnings to find the money Frances has left:
- Money left = $80 (total earnings) - $20 (total cost of trays) = $60.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day, so:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he fills in 9 holes per day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

To find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

"To ensure the docks are properly secured, I need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the current length of the dock and the existing line. For every foot of dock, 3 feet of line are needed. Given that there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 3 \text{ feet of line} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

I currently have 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line I need to purchase is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Thus, I need to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to break down the components of each reservation and then scale it up to the number of days the restaurant is open.

Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each, totaling \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- 1 bottle of wine at $5.

Thus, the total revenue per reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Given that the restaurant receives 6 reservations per night, the nightly revenue is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**
   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Determine the total profit:**
   - The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. **Find the selling price per watermelon:**
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference between the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the total cost Mark incurred for the radiator and its installation, we need to break down the expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of the Radiator:**
   - Original price: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of Mechanic's Labor:**
   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Radiator cost: $80
   - Labor cost: $150
   - Total: \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows. We know the following:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + k = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   2c + 4k = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
c + k = 20
\]
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[
(c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
k = 15
\]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
\[
c = 5
\]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices and then divide that number equally among the four people. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas, with each pizza being cut into 8 slices:
\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (4):
\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.
