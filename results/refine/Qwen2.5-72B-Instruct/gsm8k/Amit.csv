"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.
   - 150% of $80,000 is calculated as: 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the new value of the house minus the total investment.
   - Profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Thus, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"As a fitness enthusiast, I can break down James's weekly running routine for you. He runs 3 sprints each session, with each sprint covering 60 meters. Since he does this 3 times a week, we can calculate the total distance he runs each week as follows:

- Sprints per session: 3
- Distance per sprint: 60 meters
- Sessions per week: 3

Total distance per week = Sprints per session × Distance per sprint × Sessions per week
Total distance per week = 3 × 60 × 3 = 540 meters

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.
- The cost for one pair is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

There are 8 pairs in 16 glasses:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:

"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

He then turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. During this return trip, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance he covers on his return trip is:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Subtracting the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"As a door-to-door saleswoman, Melanie's sales journey can be broken down into a series of steps, each reducing the number of vacuum cleaners she has. Let's calculate the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with.

1. **Sales at the Green House:**
   - Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) at the green house.
   - After the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. **Sales at the Red House:**
   - She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.
   - After the red house, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. **Sales at the Orange House:**
   - At the orange house, she sold half of what was left.
   - The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).
   - After the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

4. **Final Count:**
   - We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \).

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} = 12
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x = 36
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = 18
     \]

Thus, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Daily Egg Consumption**: Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. **Number of Days in 4 Weeks**: There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days.
3. **Total Eggs Consumed in 4 Weeks**: Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs}\).
4. **Convert Eggs to Dozens**: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12: \(84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens}\).

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa must maintain for the remaining part of her hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa should take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles, totaling 2 hours for the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the concept of percentage discounts. If Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

The equation representing this situation is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, let's break down the guesses from each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent per day on all the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the total time spent per day:
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of.
- John has 10 dogs.

So, the total time spent per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent per week:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total time spent per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \) (total number of coins)
2. \( G = S + 30 \) (30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know \( S = 40 \), we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To calculate the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
2. Calculate the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Compute the total expenditure for the 30-day period.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts consumed
Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Over 30 days, he will consume:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. Therefore, the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Step 3: Total expenditure
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

"John initially has 13 lego sets. He sells each lego set for $15, so the total amount he earns from selling the lego sets is:

13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He then buys 8 video games, each costing $20, so the total cost of the video games is:

8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total amount he spent on the video games and the remaining money is:

$160 + $5 = $165

Since he started with $195 and has $165 accounted for, the calculation checks out. Therefore, after selling all his lego sets, John has 0 lego sets left.

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Next, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the dragon's flame reach:**
   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.

3. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the throwing distance with the gemstone:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to find the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

1. **Calculate the car's fuel efficiency:**
   - Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
   - Fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) = Distance traveled / Gallons used
   - Fuel efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

2. **Determine the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank:**
   - The car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
   - Total distance = Fuel efficiency * Tank capacity
   - Total distance = 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first calculate the inner dimensions of one box, considering the wall thickness, and then find the volume of one box. Finally, we multiply that volume by 3 to get the total volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \( 3 \) inches × \( 4 \) inches × \( 2 \) inches
   - Inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches × 3

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can break down the total TV watching time for the week and isolate Wednesday's viewing.

First, let's calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she initially bought and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270

"As a data analyst, I can break down the problem step by step to find the number of elves left after the incidents.

1. Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. This means:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ elves quit}
   \]
3. After 20 elves quit, the number of remaining elves is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ elves}
   \]
4. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. This leaves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30 \text{ elves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Miles walked on Monday:**
   - Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.

2. **Miles walked on Tuesday:**
   - Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, he walked \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

3. **Total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:**
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.

4. **Total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

5. **Miles walked on Wednesday:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is given as 700. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

2. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

3. **Number of Periods:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of two-month periods in 36 months is 36 / 2 = 18.

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Periods}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
     \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let \( S \) be Seth's current age and \( B \) be Brooke's current age.

From the first condition:
\[ S = 2B \]

From the second condition:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on Sue's front yard.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool (in gallons).
Let \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool (in gallons).

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons leaked out).
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 4S
   \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
\[
4S - 2S = 32 - 16
\]
\[
2S = 16

"James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards initially. After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the new counts are:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Calculating the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer:
\[ 33\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:**
   - The tree is 200 feet tall.
   - Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
   - Number of 10-foot sections in the tree: \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
   - Total weight of the tree: \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Calculate the weight of the wood eaten by the termites:**
   - The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
   - Weight of the wood eaten: \( 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Determine the remaining weight of the tree:**
   - Remaining weight: \( 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
- Andrea has 52 apples.

Let's denote:
- \( J_a \) as the number of apples Jamal has.
- \( J_b \) as the number of bananas Jamal has.
- \( A_a \) as the number of apples Andrea has.
- \( A_b \) as the number of bananas Andrea has.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we can find \( J_a \) using the fourth equation:
\[ A_a = 52 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we can find \( J_b \) using the third equation:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find \( A_b \) using the second equation:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

2. **Transfer Fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Loan Amount} = \$250,000

"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, where each member consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and they eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Daily Rice Consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Weekly Rice Consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the total weekly consumption is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. **Duration the Bag Will Last:**
   - The bag contains 42 kg of rice.

   Therefore, the number of weeks the bag will last is:

"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus he receives if the company performs well.

1. **Hourly Wage Calculation:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - April has 30 days, which is approximately 4.29 weeks (30 days / 7 days per week).
   - Since Watson works 5 days a week, the total number of working days in April is \( 4.29 \times 5 = 21.45 \) days. We round this down to 21 days because he cannot work a fraction of a day.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).
   - Watson earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings from his hourly wage are \( 210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars} \).

2. **Weekly Bonus Calculation:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - Total bonus for April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Total Earnings Calculation:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2100.
   - Total bonus: $1200.
   - Total earnings for April: \( 2100 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3300 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Watson made $3300 in April.

   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Loaves Remaining After Morning Sales**: 
   \[
   \text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Afternoon and Evening Sales**: Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

5. **Loaves Sold in the Afternoon**: Since the 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening:

   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Weekly weight loss}}

   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Total number of players on the football team: 105
- Number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense.
- Number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense.

Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

From the problem:
- Number of players on the offense: \( 2D \)
- Number of players on the special teams: \( \frac{D}{2} \)

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the defense, offense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required.

The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of electric poles. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
x = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Account for the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression for the number of people on the bus after the second stop:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- A class of 200 students is split into 3 groups.
- Two of the groups are equal in number.
- The smallest group is 10 students fewer than each of the other two groups.

Let \( x \) be the number of students in each of the two equal groups. Then, the smallest group has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students can be expressed as:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the activities and the time John spent on each:

1. **Boating**: 6 hours
2. **Swimming**: Half the time spent boating, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
3. **Watching shows**: 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Adding these times together gives the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

According to the problem, these 15 hours represent 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save for the phone, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her current savings.

From her first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

From her second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours:
\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding these earnings to her current savings of $80:
\[ 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:
\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]
\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Given that the choir has 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

On the day of the performance, only half of the girls can make it due to a bus breakdown:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers join the performance. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to determine how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the number of popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his goal, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. Additionally, he walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can calculate the total steps he had taken before the jog and then subtract this from the total steps he needed to reach his goal.

Steps taken before the jog:
- 5,000 steps (to and from school)
- 1,000 steps (with his friend)
Total steps before the jog = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Steps left after the jog: 2,000 steps

Total steps taken before the jog + steps taken during the jog + steps left after the jog = 10,000 steps
6,000 + steps during the jog + 2,000 = 10,000

Solving for the steps during the jog:
6,000 + steps during the jog + 2,000 = 10,000
8,000 + steps during the jog = 10,000
steps during the jog = 10,000 - 8,000
steps during the jog = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, considering the given information:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

For her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of dromedaries in a herd that consists of camels and dromedaries. We know the following:

- There are 180 heads in total.
- There are 304 humps in total.
- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of heads:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

To solve this system, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

From the first equation, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Substitute \( D \) into the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

**Final Answer:**

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: 30% of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the elevation at which the comb landed and then calculate the difference between this elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from this elevation: 
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[
6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs:**
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - He also has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he needs is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - He keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
   - The amount of money from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total money from selling the cards is $150.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C = 100
   \]
   \[
   C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get 2 hot dogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hot dog each.
   - The total number of hot dogs prepared is:
     \[
     18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is:
     \[
     80 - 54 = 26 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{1} = 26 \text{ guests}
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that this combined length represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are two remoras, the combined length is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather effectively gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Lily, David, and Bodhi together collected 43 insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found.
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found.
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma. We start by adding the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that fraction into yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 4.

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

   - To maximize the number of sticks, Frederick should focus on the option that provides the most sticks per dollar. However, since the question asks for the most sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, we will consider the 2 x 4 pieces of wood.

4. **Calculating the Number of 2 x 4 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, Frederick can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"To achieve his New Year's resolution of losing 30 lbs by July 19th, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Determine the total number of days:**
   - From December 31st to July 19th:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days

   Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.
   - Each pound of weight loss requires a deficit of 3500 calories.

"To calculate the total thickness of the four books arranged on a shelf, we need to sum their individual thicknesses. Here are the given thicknesses:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, which makes it \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, which makes it \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, we add these thicknesses together:

\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:

\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]
\[
126 + 62 = 188

"To determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made in the first three weeks:
   - First week: 18 vlogs
   - Second week: 21 vlogs
   - Third week: 15 vlogs

   Total vlogs made so far: \( 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \) vlogs

2. Subtract the total number of vlogs made from her monthly goal to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make:
   - Monthly goal: 72 vlogs
   - Vlogs made so far: 54 vlogs

   Vlogs needed: \( 72 - 54 = 18 \) vlogs

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To calculate the total amount you need to pay, we first determine the tip and then add it to your share of the bill. 

The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill:
\[ \text{Tip} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

The total bill including the tip is:
\[ \text{Total Bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since the bill is split evenly, each person pays half of the original bill:
\[ \text{Your Share of the Bill} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

However, you are responsible for the entire tip, so your total payment is:
\[ \text{Total Payment} = 25 + 10 = 35 \]

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)

4. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.
   - Daily savings in the second half: \( 2x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"To determine the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the sales into two periods and calculate the earnings for each period separately.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
- Total earnings for the first four hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
- Total earnings for the next two hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.00.

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost.

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. This means the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes she can get from the bottle is 240 washes.

Next, we calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\$24.00}{240 \text{ pumps}} = \$0.10 \text{ per pump} \]

To convert this cost into cents:

\[ \$0.10 \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- The shirt costs $25.
- The shorts cost $35.
- Total cost before discount: \( 25 + 35 = 60 \) dollars.

Next, we apply the 30% discount:
- A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost.
- Discounted total cost: \( 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money:
- Joe has $50.
- Amount left after purchase: \( 50 - 42 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, Joe will have \(\boxed{8}\) dollars left after the purchase."
"To calculate the total amount of butter needed for Juan to make croissants, we need to follow these steps:

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Monthly funding for the first 5 months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000

2. **Extended period:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for the additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Initial 5 months cost + Additional 45 months cost
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

3. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars per class.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jewel's daily production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

2. **Calculate Jewel's weekly production:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is:
     \[
     50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week}
     \]

3. **Determine Julie's daily production:**
   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
     \[
     2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day}
     \]

4. **Calculate Julie's weekly production:**
   - Julie's weekly production is:
     \[
     100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel:**
   - Adding their individual weekly totals:
     \[
     350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week}
     \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

"As a financial analyst, I can break down the costs for you in a structured manner to ensure clarity and accuracy.

James buys:
- 10 suits at $750 each.
- 10 dress pants at \( \frac{1}{5} \) the cost of a suit.
- 3 dress shirts per suit at $60 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
\[ \text{Cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the cost of the dress pants:
\[ \text{Cost of one dress pant} = \frac{750}{5} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, the cost of the dress shirts:
\[ \text{Number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total cost of everything:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"James needs to ensure that each dog at his shelter has one toy. Initially, he has 4 toys for 4 dogs. With 8 more dogs added, he needs to buy 8 more toys to have a total of 12 toys for 12 dogs. However, upon his return, he finds that the number of dogs has doubled to 24. This means he needs to buy an additional 12 toys to have a total of 24 toys for 24 dogs. When he comes back again, he finds that 3 dogs have left the shelter, reducing the number of dogs to 21. Therefore, he no longer needs 3 toys, so he needs to buy 9 more toys to have a total of 21 toys for 21 dogs.

To summarize:
- Initial toys: 4
- First purchase: 8 toys (for 8 more dogs)
- Second purchase: 12 toys (for 12 more dogs, doubling the total to 24)
- Final adjustment: -3 toys (3 dogs left, reducing the total to 21)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( L \) be the original length of the dress in centimeters.
2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is \( 1.5L \).
3. She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.
4. We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1.5L + 20 = 140
   \]
5. Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
   \[
   1.5L = 120
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let \( T \) be the age of one of the twins and \( R \) be the age of one of the triplets.

From the first piece of information, we have:
\[ T = R + 7 \]

From the second piece of information, we have:
\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the given relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the windows of the students' cars and the windows of the teachers' cars.

1. **Students' Cars:**
   - There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
   - Total number of windows in students' cars: \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) windows.
   - Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \) windows.

2. **Teachers' Cars:**
   - There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
   - Total number of windows in teachers' cars: \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) windows.
   - Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \) windows.

3. **Total Windows Smashed:**

"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. **Calculate the number of blue spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. **Calculate the percentage of blue spools:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

   Convert to a percentage:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Number of Pomeranians} = 6
   \]
   Solving for the number of Pomeranians:
   \[
   \text{Number of Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

2. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( T \) be the total number of puppies. Then:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times T = 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
2. According to the problem, the second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so the second house needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so the third house needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = \text{Driving Time} \times \text{Driving Speed} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = \text{Hiking Time} \times \text{Hiking Speed} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using a systematic approach.

Initially, Bob has:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob buys
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob buys

From the problem, we know:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \)
3. After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \)
4. The number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish: \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \)
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct)
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct)

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the components and their relationships:

- Let the amount of citrus zest be \( z \) ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total volume:

\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 10z = 10 \]

"In the first game, Sasha, playing at home, scored 14 points. Julie, playing away, scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, which means Julie scored:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points} \]

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points} \]

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add the points from each game:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

Thus, the total points Sasha scored during both games is:

"To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
   - Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
   - Each package contains 11 tins.
   - Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
   - Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
   - Each package contains 6 tins.
   - Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

3. Find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food:
   - Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
   - Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Total number of cards: 341
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote:
- The number of cards PJ has as \( P \).
- The number of cards Smendrick has as \( S \).
- The number of cards Becca has as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = 3P \)
2. \( B = S + 12 \)
3. \( P + S + B = 341 \)

Substitute \( S \) and \( B \) in terms of \( P \) into the total equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- \( P = 47 \)
- \( S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \)
- \( B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \)

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs:
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs:
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs:
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the eggs:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = 5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.

"As a professional in the field of transportation and logistics, I can break down the problem efficiently to find the total distance Mason has traveled.

Mason is traveling at a constant speed of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours initially, and then after a rest, he continues for another 6 hours. To find the total distance, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the first part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be found using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - For 3 kangaroos:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     \text{Total speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{Total speed of 4 turtles}} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all the sources of her funds and the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the new laptop's cost to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam slices 3 large apples, so the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam slices 5 small apples, so the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
- Total slices = \(15\) (from large apples) + \(15\) (from small apples) = \(30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices:
- Slices left = \(30 - 15 = 15\) slices.

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of rooms to be cleaned:**
   - The KozyInn Motel has 90 rooms.
   - We need to clean one-half of the rooms.
   - Number of rooms to be cleaned: \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) rooms.

2. **Calculate the total time required to clean these rooms:**
   - It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.
   - Total time to clean 45 rooms: \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) minutes.

3. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours: \( \frac{900}{60} = 15 \) hours.

"As a town planner, I can break down the expansion plan for the new homes over the next three years as follows:

- In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
- In the second year, the number of homes built will be three times the number built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.
- In the third year, the town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total for the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Therefore, in the third year, they will build 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Adding up the homes built over the three years, the total is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To ensure each of the 27 students in Mr. Jackson’s fourth-grade class gets 2 glue sticks, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to determine how many packs are required to meet or exceed 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks:

\[ \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning Rate:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote:
- The number of books Anne has as \( A \).
- The number of books Sofie has as \( S \).
- The number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"Kelly is grocery shopping and needs to ensure she stays within her budget. Let's break down the costs of the items she has:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs at a total cost of $10, so each pack costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   With 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
   With 7 packs, the total cost for apples is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many microphones are left without a space to fit in. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't find any space, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To calculate the total amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we need to determine the material required for each type of mask and then sum these amounts.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material required for both types of masks:
- Total material required = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"Given the problem, let's solve it step by step.

We know:
- Duncan's current age is 60.
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Let's denote:
- Duncan's current age as \( D = 60 \).
- Adam's current age as \( A \).

From the problem statement:
\[ D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides:
\[ A = 30 \]

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

Here are the numbers of Junebugs removed each day:
- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

First, let's sum these values:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding them step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

The total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

Next, we find the average by dividing the total by the number of days (5):

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle covered and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( L \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the given information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we need to calculate the hay required for the goats and the sheep separately and then sum these amounts.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- The total points scored by the team is 45.
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the points scored by Bahati.
- \( A \) as the points scored by Azibo.
- \( D \) as the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To calculate the total sleep time Kim had on her bed, we need to account for the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep duration without interruptions:**
   - Kim goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - This is a total of 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time she woke up early is 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Total time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Total time she woke up early: 5 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupied Beds:**
   The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are initially occupied.
   \[
   \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
   \]

2. **Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks:**
   The hospital admits 50 patients each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700
   \]

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the sum of the initial occupied beds and the patients admitted:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900
   \]

4. **Unoccupied Beds:**

"Given that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can determine his age by:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using the given information and algebraic equations.

We are given:
1. The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.
- \( X \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
Simplify:
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
Simplify:
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
Simplify:
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. Let's break down the journey step by step:

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

\(\boxed{162}\)"

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine the number of batches:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per batch}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Time per batch} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) flights in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the number of remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The number of remaining flights is \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**

"To solve the problem, let's break down the howl durations for each of the three wolves:

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We have a family of 6 people, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon is to be divided such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
- For the 4 kids: \( 4x \)
- For the 2 adults: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

   - Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

2. **Trey's Laps:**
   - Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.
   - Therefore, Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.

3. **Shaelyn's Laps:**
   - Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.
   - Therefore, Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.

4. **Quinn's Laps:**
   - Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.
   - Therefore, Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

5. **Difference in Laps:**
   - To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps.
   - \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

Thus, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the capacity of the tank and the amounts of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

1. **Tank Capacity:**
   - The tank has a total capacity of 18,000 gallons.

2. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the second day:
     \[
     \text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:
6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

58.9%"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the down payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the down payment amount.**
The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Jamaar has a budget of $10 and has already made several fruit purchases. Let's break down the costs:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Adding these up, the total cost of the fruits already purchased is:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the growth factor:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this growth factor to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Guests:**
   The hotel started with 100 guests.

2. **Early Checkouts:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late Checkouts:**
   15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon Check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- The price of a small stuffed animal, \( S \), is $4.
- The price of a large stuffed animal, \( L \), is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.
- Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
- The total earnings from the sales are $120.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To calculate the total amount of fabric Jim needs for his king-sized bed, we first need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

The area of one piece of fabric is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Sum of letters delivered on each day: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set.
- Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

Let \( x \) be the number of balls retrieved in the second set.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
- First set: \( x + 4 \)
- Second set: \( x \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} \)

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - Therefore, the total butter needed is:
     \[
     6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""
   - This means for every pound of butter purchased at full price, the next pound is half price.

3. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - For the first pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the second pound, the cost is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.
   - For the third pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the fourth pound, the cost is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.
   - For the fifth pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the sixth pound, the cost is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.

4. **Sum the costs:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 = 18.00
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{18.00}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the cost of 15 roses:**
   - The cost of a dozen (12) roses is $15.
   - Jenny buys 15 roses, which can be split into 12 roses and 3 additional roses.
   - The cost of 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost of 3 additional roses at $2 each is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost of 15 roses is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five 5-dollar bills, so the total amount of money she has is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

3. **Determine the change Jenny receives:**
   - The change is the total amount of money she has minus the total cost of the roses.
   - The change is \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 4 quarters, 4 dollars is equal to \(4 \times 4 = 16\) quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To determine the savings, we need to compare the total cost of buying the bananas individually versus buying them in bunches.

First, calculate the total number of bananas:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, determine the savings:

"If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S \) be the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) be the amount of fence Harry gets.

From the problem, we have:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

Substituting the second equation into the first:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"As a farmer with a good understanding of the baling process and logistics, I can break down the situation for you. 

Each hour, I manage to bale 5 bales of hay. Over a 6-hour workday, this results in:
\[ 5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales} \]

Simultaneously, the truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over the same 6-hour period, the truck will pick up:
\[ 3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales} \]

To find out how many bales are left in the field at the end of the day, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales I've made:
\[ 30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales} \]

Therefore, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining weight after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080

"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to account for the initial charge, the return, and the subsequent purchases with discounts.

1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. **Return**: She returned an item worth $15.00, so the balance after the return is:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. **Purchases**:
   - **Frying Pan**: The original price is $20.00, and it is on sale for 20% off. The discount amount is:
     \[
     20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
     \]
     Therefore, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
     \[
     20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
     \]
   - **Set of Towels**: The original price is $30.00, and it is on sale for 10% off. The discount amount is:
     \[
     30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
     \]
     Therefore, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
     \[
     30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
     \]

4. **New Balance**: Adding the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return:

   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - For 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\).

2. Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - For the next 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\).

3. Add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days:
   - Total eggs = \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\).

4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of dozens is \(\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}\).

"To determine the number of tax reports received by the IRS on Wednesday, we can use the following approach:

1. **Total Reports Last Week**: The IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.
2. **Reports on Monday and Tuesday**: A total of 1907 reports were received on Monday and Tuesday.
3. **Reports on Thursday and Friday**: A total of 2136 reports were received on Thursday and Friday.

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we subtract the sum of the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

\[
\text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total Reports Last Week} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday})
\]

\[
\text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
\]

\[
\text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043
\]

\[
\text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125
\]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes each have 200 apartments. Therefore, the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**

Adding the apartments from all three complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections per week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 3120 \text{ collections/week} \]

**Step 4: Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate.**

John gets paid $0.40 per collection:
\[ 3120 \text{ collections/week} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, John makes:

"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to consider the production for each year from age 5 to age 10, as the tree does not produce any fruit before age 5.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

To find the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]

6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]

7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]

8. Now, the length of the red rope is:
   \[
   4B = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Money Left with Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie originally had $5.
   - After giving $3 to his little sister, Ronnie is left with:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[

2. The remaining half of the mural is divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints. Therefore, the total amount of paint for these three colors is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, each color uses:
   \[
   \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using algebraic equations to find Colin's current age.

Let \( W \) represent Wendy's current age and \( C \) represent Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we can expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made per hour - Snowballs melted per hour
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour

4. **Time to Accumulate 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball accumulation.
   - Time required = \(\frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\)

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current Age of John:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.

2. **Time Frame:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.

3. **John's Age 20 Years Ago:**
   - 20 years ago, John was \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) years old.

4. **Relationship Between John's and Jim's Ages 20 Years Ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \( J \) be Jim's age 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 8 = 2J \).

5. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - \( J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

6. **Jim's Current Age:**
   - Jim's current age is \( 4 + 20 = 24 \) years old.

Thus, Jim is currently 24 years old.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backward from the final count.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost and Visits:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - For the first 5 years, the total cost is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 5 years} = 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/visit} \times 5 \text{ years} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Price Increase:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - The increase in cost is:
     \[
     150\% \text{ of } 2 \text{ dollars} = 1.5 \times 2 \text{ dollars} = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The new cost of one visit is:
     \[
     2 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost After Price Increase:**
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for the next 3 years.
   - The total cost for these 3 years is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 3 years} = 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} \times 3 \text{ years} = 45 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   S = M + 12
   \]
   where \( S \) is the number of paintings Shelley has and \( M \) is the number of paintings Samantha has. Substituting \( M = 27 \):
   \[
   S = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
   So, Shelley has 39 paintings.
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   S = K + 8
   \]
   where \( K \) is the number of paintings Kim has. Substituting \( S = 39 \):
   \[
   39 = K + 8

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - So, the price in December is $72.

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights that Brianna's family has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - Each of the 4 people in the house has a flashlight.
   - Each of the 8 rooms has 2 flashlights.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 (people) + 2 * 8 (rooms) = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - Half of the 8 rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the 8 rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.
   - Total small candles = 4 small candles/room * 4 rooms = 16 small candles
   - Total medium candles = 5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms = 20 medium candles
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36 = 56

"To solve the Rubik's cube, let's break down the time taken for each side:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's sum up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption for the pigs over that period and then subtract it from the initial amount of feed Dexter ordered.

1. **Daily Feed Consumption per Pig:**
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
   - Daily consumption per pig = 4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day.

2. **Daily Feed Consumption for All Pigs:**
   - Dexter has 5 pigs.
   - Total daily consumption for 5 pigs = 8 pounds/day/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Weekly Feed Consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly consumption = 40 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week.

4. **Feed Left After a Week:**
   - Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
   - Feed left after a week = 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed:**
   - John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
   - Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.

2. **Determine the number of additional hot dogs required:**
   - John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.
   - Additional hot dogs needed = Total hot dogs needed - Hot dogs already available
   - Additional hot dogs needed = 40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs.

3. **Calculate the number of packs of hot dogs John needs to buy:**
   - Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
   - Number of packs needed = Additional hot dogs needed / Hot dogs per pack
   - Number of packs needed = 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each pack costs $2.
   - Total cost = Number of packs needed * Cost per pack
   - Total cost = 6 packs * $2/pack = $12.

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

Given:
- The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There are 200 feet of dock.
- The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line.

First, calculate the total amount of line needed:
\[ 3 \text{ feet of line/foot of dock} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, subtract the line the caretaker already has from the total required:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to break down the components of each reservation and then scale it up to the number of days the restaurant is open.

Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each, totaling \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- 1 bottle of wine at $5.

So, the total revenue per reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night, so the revenue per night is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"As a fruit vendor, I understand the importance of calculating costs and profits accurately to ensure a successful business. Here’s how I would calculate the selling price per watermelon:

1. **Determine the total cost of the watermelons:**
   - I bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - The profit margin is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the peeling rate for Ana:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Ana can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Determine the peeling rate for Jane:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Jane can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after one hour is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Radiator:**
   - The original price of the radiator is $400.
   - The discount is 80%, so the discount amount is:
     \[
     400 \times 0.80 = 320
     \]
   - Therefore, the price Mark pays for the radiator is:
     \[
     400 - 320 = 80
     \]

2. **Cost of Mechanic's Labor:**
   - The mechanic charges $50 per hour.
   - The installation takes 3 hours, so the total labor cost is:
     \[
     50 \times 3 = 150
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total amount Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost:
     \[
     80 + 150 = 230
     \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices and then divide that number equally among the four people (Henry and his three friends).

First, calculate the total number of slices:
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- There are 7 pizzas.

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Next, divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
- There are 4 people.

Slices per person = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.
