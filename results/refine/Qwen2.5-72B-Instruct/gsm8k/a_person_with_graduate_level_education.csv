"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Initial Investment Calculation:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total initial investment: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Value Increase Calculation:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.
   - 150% of $80,000 is calculated as: \( 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \)
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is: \( 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \)

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total initial investment.
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Thus, the profit Josh made is:

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the flock:**
   - Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi has 20 chickens.
   - Therefore, the total daily feed requirement is:
     \[
     20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of feed already given:**
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   - Therefore, the total feed given so far is:
     \[
     15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - The total daily requirement is 60 cups.
   - The total feed already given is 40 cups.
   - Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
     \[
     60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
     \]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Given the problem, we can use algebraic expressions to determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

From the problem statement:
1. Seattle has 20 sheep: \( S = 20 \).
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle: \( C = 4S \).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston: \( T = 2C \).

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the initial partial download, the Windows restart, and the subsequent full download.

1. **Initial Partial Download:**
   - Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file.
   - 40% of 200 GB is calculated as:
     \[
     0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB}
     \]
   - The download rate is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 80 GB is:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Full Download After Restart:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.
   - The time to download the full 200 GB file at 2 GB/minute is:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the initial partial download time, the Windows restart time, and the full download time:
     \[
     40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to break down the problem into several steps, considering the different segments of his journey.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance traveled away from home: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next 0.5 hours, he drives at 30 mph:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   - Total distance traveled back home:
     \[
     \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
     \]

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   - Distance from home at the end of the 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the relationship between distance, time, and speed.

Given:
- Total distance of the trail: 12 miles
- Desired average speed: 4 miles per hour

First, we calculate the total time required to complete the trail at the desired average speed:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we account for the time Marissa has already spent:
- Time taken for the first 4 miles: 1 hour
- Time taken for the next 2 miles: 1 hour
- Total time already spent: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

The remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Already Walked} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in the remaining time:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To determine the original price of the book before the discount, we can use the relationship between the discounted price and the original price. Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. A 25% discount means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

Thus, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we first calculate the total cost of the other items she purchased. The cost of one chicken meal is $12. The cost of 5 packs of milk, each priced at $3, is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 4 apples, each priced at $1.50, is:

\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:

\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars} \]

Marie paid a total of $50. The amount spent on pizza is the difference between the total payment and the cost of the other items:

\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find the number of pizza boxes, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:

\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To determine the total expenditure on ice cream over a 60-day period, we can break down the problem into a few straightforward steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of servings consumed:**
   - Cynthia consumes 1 serving of ice cream per day.
   - Over 60 days, the total number of servings is:
     \[
     1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of cartons required:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings.
   - The number of cartons needed is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - The total cost for 4 cartons is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break down the trip into segments based on the information provided:

1. Henry's first stop was after traveling 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means he stopped at the 45-mile mark (60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles).

The distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (45 miles) is calculated as follows:

\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

Given:
- The cost of the first pair of high heels is \( \$33 \).
- The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = \$66 \).

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = \$99 \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and their total age.

Let \( D \) represent Darrell's age and \( A \) represent Allen's age. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We are also given that the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D \) from the ratio equation into the sum equation:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, solve for \( A \) by multiplying both sides by 11:
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Now, divide both sides by 18:
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[ \boxed{109} \]"
"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the mean of the guesses provided by Gunter's friends. The guesses are as follows:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

These can be translated into the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels: \( R = 40 \).
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels: \( A = \frac{R}{2} + 5 \).
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron: \( S = A - 2 \).

First, we calculate the number of jewels Aaron has:
\[
A = \frac{R}{2} + 5 = \frac{40}{2} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, then divide the distance by the time.

1. **Total Distance**: John runs 60 miles a week.

2. **Total Time**:
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent running each week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Average Speed**:
   - The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speeds at which Dana can run and walk, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, her throwing distance is tripled.
   - Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the dragon's flame reach:**
   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.

3. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to perform a straightforward calculation based on the given constraints.

1. **Bridge's weight limit**: 5000 pounds.
2. **Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck**: 3755 pounds.
3. **Weight of each box**: 15 pounds.

First, we calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck:
\[ \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 \, \text{pounds} - 3755 \, \text{pounds} = 1245 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, we determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:
\[ \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \frac{1245 \, \text{pounds}}{15 \, \text{pounds/box}} = 83 \, \text{boxes} \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To determine the total expenditure on gift bags for Christina's birthday party, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the expected number of attendees:**
   - Christina invited 16 friends, but historically, 1/4 of the invited guests do not show up. Therefore, the expected number of attendees is:
     \[
     \text{Expected attendees} = 16 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{4}\right) = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12
     \]

2. **Determine the number of gift bags needed:**
   - Christina plans to have 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. Since she invited 16 friends, the total number of gift bags required is:
     \[
     \text{Number of gift bags} = 16 \times 0.75 = 12
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each gift bag costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the gift bags is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 12 \times 2 = 24
     \]

Thus, Christina will spend:

\[
24

"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adult dinosaurs:**
   - Each adult dinosaur consumes 10 pounds of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
   - Total potato salad for adults = \( 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the child dinosaurs:**
   - Each child dinosaur consumes half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10 \, \text{lbs}}{2} = 5 \, \text{lbs} \).
   - There are 5 child dinosaurs.
   - Total potato salad for children = \( 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \).

3. **Sum the total amounts of potato salad for both adults and children:**
   - Total potato salad needed = \( 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \).

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure there is enough for all the dinosaurs.

"Given the problem, we can use basic algebra to determine the number of pets each person has and then sum them up.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of pets Cindy has. According to the problem, \( C = 4 \).
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so the number of pets Marcia has is \( M = C + 2 \). Substituting \( C = 4 \), we get \( M = 4 + 2 = 6 \).
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so the number of pets Jan has is \( J = 3M \). Substituting \( M = 6 \), we get \( J = 3 \times 6 = 18 \).

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has:
\[ \text{Total pets} = C + M + J = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:

"Given the relationships and ages among the four children, we can set up a series of equations to determine Jackson's age. Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James as \( A \), \( J \), \( C \), and \( M \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

First, we can use the information about James and Corey to find Corey's age:
\[ M = 10 \]
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, we can use Amy's age to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's new time for running the 400-meter hurdles after his speed improvement. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means he can run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - Gerald's improved time is \( 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \) seconds.

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs.
2. Let \( C \) represent the number of cats.
3. Let \( R \) represent the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of dogs \( D \) is 60.
- The number of cats \( C \) is twice the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D \).
- The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

First, we calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ D + C = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

Then, we calculate the number of rabbits:
\[ R = D + C - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Finally, we find the total number of pets by summing the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[

"To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we need to consider the volume reduction and the volume of tomatoes per can.

1. **Volume Reduction**: When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, the volume is halved. Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce produced.
   - Given that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, the initial volume of tomatoes is:
     \[
     32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Volume per Can**: Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.
   - To find the number of cans used, we divide the initial volume of tomatoes by the volume per can:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find the total number of tomatoes used, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Driving Through in the First 15 Minutes**: Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. **Cars Driving Through in the Remaining 15 Minutes**: 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. **Cars Taking an Exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"Mary, an avid gardener, received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery, adding to her existing collection. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges in her large country home. To determine the total number of potted plants she currently has, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Initial number of plants} = 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Adding the 18 new potted plants she received:

\[ \text{Total number of plants} = 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the number of plants she will give away is:

\[ \text{Plants given away} = 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants given away from the total number of plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To solve the problem of determining how long it will take for a fog bank to cover a city that is 42 miles across, given that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, we can use a simple proportion.

First, we need to find the total time required to cover the entire 42 miles. We know the rate of the fog bank's movement is 3 miles per 10 minutes. We can set up the proportion as follows:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply and solve the equation:

\[
3x = 42 \times 10
\]

\[
3x = 420
\]

\[
x = \frac{420}{3}
\]

\[
x = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the number of pieces Poppy places on the board. Given that the puzzle has 1000 pieces and Poppy places a quarter of them:

\[
\text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we determine the number of pieces remaining after Poppy has placed her pieces:

\[
\text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Poppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces:

\[
\text{Pieces placed by Poppy's mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of pieces left to be placed after Poppy's mom has placed her pieces:

\[
\text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}

"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Summing these times:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Given that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes} \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. According to the problem:

1. Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
2. He actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
3. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]
\[ 2x = 115 - 15 \]

"To determine Sasha's profit from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate both the total cost of the lumber she initially purchased and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, we calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
  \[
  \$270 - \$180 = \$90

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later, given the initial conditions and the percentage increases.

1. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.30L = 1.30L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \approx 30769.23
   \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000
   \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%) as Adrien's:
   \[
   \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 + 12307.69 = 43076.92
   \]

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   \[
   \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92
   \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to consider her varying speeds over the time period. We can break this down into two segments:

1. **First 3 hours:**
   - Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \).

2. **Next 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie's speed decreases to 5 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the next 4 hours: \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \).

3. **Total distance:**
   - The total distance covered in 7 hours is the sum of the distances from both segments: \( \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \).

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles.

"To determine the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) represent the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought. According to the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. After these actions, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

We can express the total number of spoons Julia had after her husband's contribution and before using any for sampling as:
\[ x + 5 \]

After using 3 spoons to sample the stew, the number of spoons left is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 \]

We know that this equals 12 spoons:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate both the total revenue generated from patient charges and the total cost incurred for doctors' services. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Total Time Spent on Patients:**
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients per day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Total Revenue from Patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Total Cost for Doctors' Services:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

   - In the next 6 hours, half of the bees that left initially return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Second Departure:**
   - In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left the hive leave again.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Final Return:**
   - In the last 6 hours, all the bees that had left and not yet returned come back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and had not returned = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the second departure and had not returned = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first departure) + 60 (from the second departure) = 75 bees.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for one adult and one child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Thus, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ 30 \]

"Given the problem, we can set up the relationships between the number of Facebook friends each person has as follows:

Let \( D \) represent the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.

We are given that Charlie has 12 friends:
\[ 3D = 12 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we can find the number of friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, as the speeds are given in feet per minute:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel their respective distances:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their travel times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"To determine the initial number of french fries in the pack, we can set up an equation based on the sequence of events described. Let \( x \) represent the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries:
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:
   \[
   x - 21 - 3 \times 3 = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. Ants carried off one fry:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. Five fries were left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
\[
x = 48

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the weekly class hours:**
   - On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, each lasting 1 hour. Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
     \]
   - Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours for these days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

   - On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, each lasting 2 hours. Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is:
     \[
     2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
     \]
   - Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours for these days is:
     \[
     2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

2. **Sum the weekly class hours:**
   - The total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week is:
     \[
     9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total class hours for the semester:**
   - There are 16 weeks in the semester, so the total number of hours Kimo spends in class over the semester is:
     \[
     17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[

"To determine the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert the lengths of each type of baked good to feet and then sum them up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - The total length of all the baked goods is the sum of the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes.

"To calculate the total number of bananas required for 2 months, we first need to determine the monthly consumption for all the apes combined. The monthly requirements are as follows:

- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas

Summing these values gives the total monthly consumption:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly consumption by 2 to find the total number of bananas required for the 2-month period:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable to this scenario of repeated percentage increases.

1. **Initial Price and Increase Rate:**
   - Initial price: \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars
   - Increase rate: \( r = 0.20 \) (20%)
   - Time period for each increase: 2 months
   - Total time: 36 months

2. **Number of Increases:**
   - Number of 2-month periods in 36 months: \( n = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

3. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The formula for the final price after \( n \) increases is:
     \[
     P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

4. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator to find \( (1.20)^{18} \):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):

"To determine the total distance Pancho walks in a week, we can break down the calculation into two parts: the distance walked on weekdays and the distance walked on weekends.

1. **Weekday Walking Distance:**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Therefore, the total distance walked on weekdays is \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Weekend Walking Distance:**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total distance walked on weekends is \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Total Weekly Walking Distance:**
   - Adding the distances from weekdays and weekends gives us the total weekly distance.
   - Total distance = \( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, the total distance Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles.

"To determine the number of votes the losing candidate received, we start by calculating the number of votes the winning candidate received. Given that the winner secured \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes and the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the winner's votes as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the losing candidate received is the difference between the total votes and the votes for the winner:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser received is:

"To address the problem, we need to determine the number of red roses Fred must deliver to Sandra by 5 pm. Let's break down the information provided:

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
2. Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations.

Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations. According to the problem:

\[ 200 = 5C \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know the number of white carnations is 40. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4C = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) represent Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: 
     \[
     J = M + 2
     \]
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     M - 2 = 14 + 5
     \]

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   \[
   M = 19 + 2
   \]
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 21 + 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 23

"To address the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two distinct events and then determine the relative likelihood of one event compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Relative Likelihood
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

### Final Answer:
200%"
"Given that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate the total number of apples they both picked as follows:

Let \( M \) represent the number of apples Jenna's mother picked, which is 20. Jenna picked half of this amount, so:

\[ J = \frac{M}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother is:

\[ M + J = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total straw for the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \) pieces.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, with one hamster per cage.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total straw for the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) pieces.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can now set up the equation for the total straw:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 18r = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after \( n \) months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let \( x \) represent the number of bags.

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30, so the profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit made by the trader is $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

2. **Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores:**
   - Sum of the remaining scores: \( 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \)

3. **Determine the total sum needed for an average of 93 with five tests:**
   - The desired average is 93, and we are considering the five highest scores.
   - Total sum needed: \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \)

4. **Calculate the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The sum of the five highest scores (including the sixth test) should be 465.
   - Therefore, \( 367 + x = 465 \)
   - Solving for \( x \): \( x = 465 - 367 = 98 \)

Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike, we can break the problem into two segments based on the different riding frequencies and distances.

**First Segment:**
- Frequency: 5 times per week
- Distance per ride: 25 kilometers
- Duration: 4 weeks

The total distance for the first segment can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total distance (first segment)} = 5 \, \text{rides/week} \times 25 \, \text{km/ride} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} \]
\[ \text{Total distance (first segment)} = 500 \, \text{km} \]

**Second Segment:**
- Frequency: 2 times per week
- Distance per ride: 60 kilometers
- Duration: 3 weeks

The total distance for the second segment can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total distance (second segment)} = 2 \, \text{rides/week} \times 60 \, \text{km/ride} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} \]
\[ \text{Total distance (second segment)} = 360 \, \text{km} \]

**Total Distance:**
To find the total distance Micheal rode over the entire period, we sum the distances from both segments:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 500 \, \text{km} + 360 \, \text{km} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 860 \, \text{km} \]

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight contributions from both the chocolate bars and the candied apples.

1. **Weight of the Chocolate Bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = \( 25 \times 40 \) grams = 1000 grams.

2. **Weight of the Candied Apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs \( \frac{40}{2} \) grams = 20 grams.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = \( 80 \times 20 \) grams = 1600 grams.

3. **Total Weight of the Bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples = 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost per cup given the relationship between the cost of cups and plates. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   \[
   \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800
   \]

3. **Convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:**
   - One dozen is 12 cups.
   - Twenty dozen is:
   \[
   20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost per cup:**
   - The total cost of 240 cups is $34800.
   \[
   \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
   \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:

"To determine the number of times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is:

\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings, her total savings are:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:

\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:

\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

Thus, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time \( t \) it takes for Gary to walk this distance. The time is given by the formula:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

where \( d \) is the distance and \( v \) is the speed. Given:
- Distance \( d = 15 \text{ miles} \)
- Speed \( v = 3 \text{ miles/hour} \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can use the information provided and set up a simple equation. 

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. The equation for the total number of customers over the three days is:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

Given the conditions:
1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, we express the amounts of water in the pools 4 minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

From the first condition:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

From the second condition:
\[ B = 4S \]

We substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Thus, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, including the 10% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount she will pay over the 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay an additional 10% interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months, paying $165 each month:

\[ \text{Total Paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance:

\[ \text{Remaining Balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

\[ 220 \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of flower in the vase. We know there are 4 roses. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

"Given the problem, we start by defining the current ages of the individuals involved:

- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
  \[
  \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
  \]
- Harriet is half the age of Zack:
  \[
  \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
  \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

To find the average age of the three individuals in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

   \frac{42 \, \text{tomatoes/week}}{2} = 21 \, \text{tomatoes/week}
   \]

3. The total weekly consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend is:
   \[
   42 \, \text{tomatoes/week} + 21 \, \text{tomatoes/week} = 63 \, \text{tomatoes/week}
   \]

4. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find the number of vines needed to meet the total weekly consumption, we divide the total weekly consumption by the production rate of one vine:
   \[
   \frac{63 \, \text{tomatoes/week}}{3 \, \text{tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \, \text{vines}
   \]

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines.

   Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3
   \]
   So, Mike has 3 active pen pals.

2. **Determine the total number of letters received per week:**
   Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week.
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]
   Therefore, Mike receives 6 letters per week.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages to be written in response:**
   Each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike responds in kind.
   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30
   \]
   So, Mike needs to write 30 pages per week.

4. **Determine the total time spent writing:**
   Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   \[
   30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have consumed 30% of its wood, we can follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before termite damage:**
   - The tree is 200 feet tall.
   - Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
   - The total number of 10-foot sections in the tree is \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
   - Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Determine the weight of the wood eaten by the termites:**
   - The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
   - The weight of the wood eaten is \( 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the remaining weight of the tree:**
   - The remaining weight is the total weight minus the weight of the wood eaten.
   - Therefore, the remaining weight is \( 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is:

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem and then solve for the unknowns.

Let \( J_a \) represent the number of apples Jamal has, and \( J_b \) represent the number of bananas Jamal has. We are given the following information:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:
   \[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
   \[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
4. Andrea has 52 apples:
   \[ A_a = 52 \]

First, we substitute the value of \( A_a \) into the first equation to find \( J_a \):
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the value of \( J_a \) to find \( J_b \):
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]

3. **Transfer Fee**: The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

5. **Difference from Budget**: Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. The difference between the total cost and her budget is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
   \]

Thus, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the distinct phases of heating the oil and cooking the chicken, and then sum the times for each phase.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - This is the sum of the time to heat to 300 degrees and the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees.
   - Total heating time: \( 20 + 28 = 48 \) minutes.

4. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time to warm up the oil.
   - Time to cook the chicken: \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) minutes.

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - This is the sum of the total heating time and the cooking time.
   - Total time: \( 48 + 43 = 91 \) minutes.

Thus, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we can start by breaking down the total number of stitches used for the different parts of the sweater.

1. The body of the sweater requires 900 stitches.
2. The collar requires a tenth of the body's stitches, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette requires twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Next, we sum the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total project is 1800 stitches, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the problem into parts and calculate each segment step by step.

1. **Lines in the solo song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **Lines in the first scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Thus, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines.

3. **Lines in the second scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Thus, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

4. **Total lines Sean has to memorize:**
   - Lines from the song: 54
   - Lines from the first scene: 36

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To determine half the number of spots that all the cobras and mambas have combined, we start by calculating the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( A \) represent the number of medals Ali has, and \( I \) represent the number of medals Izzy has. According to the problem:

1. Ali has 22 medals:
   \[
   A = 22
   \]

2. Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali:
   \[
   I = A - 5
   \]
   Substituting \( A = 22 \):
   \[
   I = 22 - 5 = 17
   \]

3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out for counting. Let \( T \) represent the total number of medals given out. Therefore:
   \[
   A + I = \frac{T}{10}
   \]
   Substituting \( A = 22 \) and \( I = 17 \):
   \[
   22 + 17 = \frac{T}{10}
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   39 = \frac{T}{10}
   \]

4. To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:
   \[
   T = 39 \times 10 = 390

"To solve the problem, let's first determine the points each player has after the initial three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, which is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to account for the extra points awarded in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player receives an extra point if they have more than 20 points:

- Mike has 21 points, so he receives an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not receive an extra point: \(18\) points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he receives an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum the points of all three players after the fourth round:

\[

"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break down the problem into a series of calculations:

1. **Daily Rice Consumption:**
   Each member consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members and they eat rice twice a day:
   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Weekly Rice Consumption:**
   To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. **Duration of the 42 kg Bag:**
   Finally, to determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
   \[
   \text{Duration} = \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses, we need to break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, his weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Weekly weight loss}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided to establish a series of equations and then solve for the unknowns. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Current Age of Cera:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.

2. **Age of Noah Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

3. **Current Age of Noah:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense. According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense: \( O = 2D \).
2. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense: \( S = \frac{D}{2} \).
3. The total number of players on the team is 105: \( D + O + S = 105 \).

Substituting the expressions for \( O \) and \( S \) into the total number of players equation, we get:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is given as $0.1. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine the total weakening effect on Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the number of junior programmers:**
   Given that the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100:
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of senior programmers:**
   The total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**
   The monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000, and senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers:
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:**
   The number of junior programmers is 40, and each is paid $2000 per month:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:**
   The number of senior programmers is 60, and each is paid $2400 per month:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

6. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all programmers:**
   The total monthly salary for all programmers is the sum of the total monthly salaries for junior and senior programmers:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
   \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first stop, 5 more people boarded the bus. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 more people boarded. Thus, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression for the number of people on the bus after the second stop:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2,000
- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2,000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, which is 10 students fewer than each of the other groups, will have \( x - 10 \) students.

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 70 \]

Now, we find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from \( x \):

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To determine the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

This gives us the equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we have the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs:
\[ \text{Total legs from cows} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs from chickens} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Given the problem, we can start by defining the weight of the pink frog as 50 pounds. From this, we can deduce the weights of the other animals based on the relationships provided:

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so both the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the weight of the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

"To determine how much more Annabelle needs to save for the phone, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add this to her current savings. 

From her first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

From her second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding these earnings to her current savings of $80, her total savings are:
\[ 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The cost of the phone is $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:
\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we start by defining the heights of the three trees. Let \( h_1 \) be the height of the shortest tree, \( h_2 \) be the height of the second tree, and \( h_3 \) be the height of the tallest tree.

Given:
- The height of the shortest tree, \( h_1 = 6 \) feet.
- The height of the second tree, \( h_2 = h_1 + 5 \) feet.

First, we calculate the height of the second tree:
\[
h_2 = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[
h_1 + h_2 = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
\]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[
h_3 = 2 \times (h_1 + h_2) = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[
\boxed{34}

   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the total change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, which means the $2 spent on gumballs is half of his change.
   \[
   \text{Total change before buying gumballs} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy started with $10.
   - He had $4 left as change after buying candy.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on candy} = 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.50 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Number of pounds of candy} = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds}

"Let's denote the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 3 \).

Next, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is given by \( 4M - 5 \). Substituting \( M = 3 \):
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

The total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( O \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
\[ M + (4M - 5) + 3(4M - 5) + O = 50 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50 \]

Simplifying the left side:

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the Interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount ($3,650),
   - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (10% or 0.10),
   - \( t \) is the time in years (5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) years).

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   I = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Amount to be Repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   \[
   A = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   A = 3802.50

3. **Calculate the Monthly Payment:**
   The monthly payment is the total amount divided by the number of months:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{A}{n}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of months (5).

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}

"To determine the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the information that he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means that the remaining \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog, we can use the principles of probability and expected value.

Given:
- Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means the probability of a candle exploding is \(1 - 0.99 = 0.01\).
- 5% of the exploding candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, which means the probability of an exploding candle also smelling like wet dog is \(0.05\).

First, we calculate the expected number of candles that will explode:
\[
\text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
\]

Next, we calculate the expected number of these exploding candles that also smell like wet dog:
\[
\text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
\]

Therefore, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:
\[
\boxed{25}

- The discount is 30%.

First, calculate the discount amount per blouse:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Next, determine the discounted price per blouse:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Finally, calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees (half of 30).
- Joanne gathers \( x \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister:
- Gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Does not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

Thus, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:
1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each):
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, we solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach to determine the number of cats left on the rock.

1. **Initial Number of Cats**: There are initially 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats Carried Away by Boats**: Four boats each carry away 5 cats. Therefore, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:
   \[
   4 \text{ boats} \times 5 \text{ cats/boat} = 20 \text{ cats}
   \]

3. **Remaining Cats After Boats**: Subtract the number of cats carried away by the boats from the initial number of cats:
   \[
   50 \text{ cats} - 20 \text{ cats} = 30 \text{ cats}
   \]

4. **Cats Running After a Mouse**: Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats run after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 30 \text{ cats} = 18 \text{ cats}
   \]

5. **Final Number of Cats Left**: Subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, and then find the difference between these original prices.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

1. **Homemade Feeders:**
   - Number of homemade feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per homemade feeder: 20 + 10 = 30 birds

2. **Store-Bought Feeders:**
   - Number of store-bought feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per store-bought feeder: 20 birds

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- **Total birds attracted by homemade feeders:**
  \[
  3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds}
  \]

- **Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders:**
  \[
  3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see each day:

"To determine the number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( C \) represent the total number of cards Kenny initially had.

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. Each card is sold for $1.5. The total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is given by:

\[ \text{Total money from selling cards} = \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so the total amount of money he makes is $150. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

Thus, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To address the problem, let's break it down systematically:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was tasked with preparing gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs each, and the other half to have one hot dog each.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hot dogs for the 18 guests who would have two hot dogs.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hot dog, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hot dogs for them.
   - In total, the caterer prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hot dogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs.
   - The total number of hot dogs required is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hot dogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hot dogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6. 

Next, we calculate the number of letters in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half the number of letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3, and adding 4 to this gives us:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, her sister's name has 7 letters.

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time difference in the departure times of Wayne and Bernadette to ensure that Bernadette arrives 5 minutes before Wayne at the premiere.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time from his hotel to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \), Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

4. **Determine the difference in their departure times:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes.
   - Bernadette leaves at \( T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the given length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is:

"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to account for the temperature changes due to baking and the subsequent cooling from opening the window.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking:**
   Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Temperature increase} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} = 15 \, \text{degrees}
   \]
   Therefore, the temperature after baking is:
   \[
   \text{Temperature after baking} = 40 \, \text{degrees} + 15 \, \text{degrees} = 55 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window:**
   Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   \[
   \text{Total cooling} = \left(\frac{30 \, \text{minutes}}{10 \, \text{minutes}}\right) \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 3 \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 6 \, \text{degrees}
   \]
   Therefore, the final temperature after the window is opened is:
   \[
   \text{Final temperature} = 55 \, \text{degrees} - 6 \, \text{degrees} = 49 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

   - James finishes 10% faster:
   \[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

2. **Bike:**
   - Jon's bike time: 80 minutes
   - James takes 5 minutes longer:
   \[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Run:**
   - Let \( R \) be the time it took James to run.
   - Jon's total time: 170 minutes
   - James' total time: \( 36 + 85 + R \)
   - Jon won by 10 minutes, so:
   \[ 36 + 85 + R = 170 + 10 \]
   \[ 121 + R = 180 \]
   \[ R = 180 - 121 \]
   \[ R = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the time it took James to do the run is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of hay required for the horse based on the distance it runs and the cost of the hay, and then determine the change Michael has after purchasing the hay.

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes.
   - Convert 30 minutes to hours: \( \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \) hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

2. **Determine the amount of hay needed:**
   - The horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) bail of hay per mile.
   - Hay needed = 16 miles × \( \frac{1}{2} \) bail per mile = 8 bails of hay.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Total cost = 8 bails × $3 per bail = $24.

4. **Determine the total amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six $5 bills.
   - Total money = 6 × $5 = $30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using algebraic reasoning.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( P \) be the regular price of the popcorn.
   - The cost of the soda is given as $3.
   - The cost of a movie ticket is $12.

2. **Calculate the total cost without the super ticket:**
   - The total cost without the super ticket is the sum of the movie ticket, the soda, and the popcorn:
     \[
     \text{Total cost without super ticket} = 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost with the super ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20 and includes the movie and one popcorn with a soda for an additional $1:
     \[
     \text{Total cost with super ticket} = 20 + 1 = 21
     \]

4. **Determine the savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket:
     \[
     \text{Total cost without super ticket} = \text{Total cost with super ticket} - 2
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     15 + P = 21 - 2
     \]
     Simplify the equation:
     \[
     15 + P = 19
     \]

5. **Solve for \( P \):**
   \[
   P = 19 - 15
   \]
   \[
   P = 4
   \]

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To determine the cost Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original cost per balloon.
2. Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

First, we find the original cost per balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. The cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:

"To determine the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then use these to find the average speed.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 miles per hour (mph) for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}

"To determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year, we can break down the problem into a series of steps and apply basic arithmetic and fractions.

1. **Initial Number of Pencils:**
   - There are 30 students in Marissa's class.
   - Each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total initial pencils = \( 30 \times 10 = 300 \) pencils.

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - After two months, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \) pencils.
   - Remaining pencils after two months = \( 300 - 60 = 240 \) pencils.

3. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, only \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \) pencils.

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is \( 80 \).

"To determine the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the given conditions. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that this combined length represents.

First, we convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are two remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion from set theory. This principle helps us avoid double-counting students who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( |A| \) as the number of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( |B| \) as the number of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( |A \cap B| \) as the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.
- \( |A \cup B| \) as the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \)
- \( |B| = 6 \)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we calculate the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ |U| - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):

- Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein.
- Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4. We convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein to yards. Since one full skein is 364 yards, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Given the dimensions and relationships provided, we can calculate the length of the couch as follows:

1. The width of the chair is given as 3 feet.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the width of the rug is:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, the length of the couch is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 of these packs were strawberry, and we need to find the cost of each pack.
- 1 pack was grape, costing $2.
- 1 pack was green apple, costing half as much as the grape pack, so $1.

The total cost of all the gum was $7. Let \( S \) represent the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

The equation for the total cost is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to analyze the cost and yield of each type of wood and then optimize the purchase within his budget.

1. **Cost and Yield Analysis:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

2. **Budget Constraint:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Optimization Strategy:**
   - To maximize the number of sticks, we should focus on the cost-effectiveness of each type of wood.
   - The cost per stick for a 2 x 4 piece of wood is \( \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \) dollars per stick.
   - The cost per stick for a 2 x 8 piece of wood is \( \frac{6}{400} = 0.015 \) dollars per stick.

   Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is more cost-effective, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 pieces. However, the question specifically asks for the maximum number of sticks if he buys the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Sticks with 2 x 4 Wood:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, Frederick can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"To calculate the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to consider the following:

1. Each dog has 4 legs, and each pair of snowshoes is designed to cover 2 legs.
2. The cost of each pair of snowshoes is $12.00.

First, we calculate the total number of legs:
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 6 \, \text{dogs} \times 4 \, \text{legs/dog} = 24 \, \text{legs} \]

Next, we determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed:
\[ \text{Number of pairs} = \frac{24 \, \text{legs}}{2 \, \text{legs/pair}} = 12 \, \text{pairs} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \, \text{pairs} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/pair} = 144 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

"To determine the savings Janet would achieve by purchasing a weekly bus pass, we can follow a straightforward economic analysis:

1. **Calculate the total cost of individual bus trips:**
   - Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week.
   - Total number of bus trips per week = 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.
   - Cost per bus trip = $2.20.
   - Total cost of bus trips per week = 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week.

2. **Compare the total cost of individual bus trips to the cost of the weekly bus pass:**
   - Cost of the weekly bus pass = $20.00.

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost of bus trips without the pass - Cost of the weekly bus pass
   - Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"To achieve his New Year's resolution of losing 30 pounds by his birthday on July 19th, Andy needs to establish a consistent daily calorie deficit. Given that today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days until July 19th and then determine the required daily calorie deficit.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:

- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it is not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Next, we need to determine the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. It is generally accepted that a deficit of 3500 calories results in the loss of one pound of body weight.

Total calorie deficit required = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( L \) represent the cost of the lot and \( H \) represent the cost of the house.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, we solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

With the value of \( L \) known, we can find \( H \) using the second equation:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:
\[ 90,000 \]"

"Given the problem, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \). Similarly, let \( C_J \) and \( S_J \) represent the number of chairs and sofas Jenna has, respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
3. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
4. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).

First, we use the information that Ophelia has 20 sofas to find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we determine the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8-week period, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Regular Weekly Workouts:**
   - Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for most of the weeks.
   - Total weeks: 8
   - Weeks with 4 hours: \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks (since 3 weeks have different durations)
   - Total hours for these 5 weeks: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours

2. **Increased Weekly Workouts:**
   - For 2 consecutive weeks, he spent 5 hours each week.
   - Total hours for these 2 weeks: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours
   - For 1 week, he spent 6 hours.
   - Total hours for this 1 week: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

3. **Total Hours:**
   - Sum of all hours: \(20 + 10 + 6 = 36\) hours

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach to track the number of passengers on the bus at each stop.

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - The bus starts with 48 passengers.

2. **First Stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - Number of passengers remaining: \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
   - 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus.
   - Number of passengers getting on: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - Total number of passengers after the first stop: \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)

3. **Second Stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - Number of passengers remaining: \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus.
   - Number of passengers getting on: \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   - Total number of passengers after the second stop: \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

Thus, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then find the difference between their ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm}
\]

Performing the addition step-by-step:
\[
31 + 50 = 81

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total Days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the Month into Two Halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

4. **Savings in the Second Half:**
   - Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \).
   - The total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total savings for the month of April is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 1125 \)
   - \( 45x = 1125 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the Amount Saved Each Day in the Second Half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad receives, and \( J \) represent the amount of money Jeff receives. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, which can be expressed as:

\[ J = 4B \]

Additionally, the total amount of money to be divided is 100 dollars, which gives us the equation:

\[ J + B = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 4B + B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( B = 20 \) back into the equation \( J = 4B \):

\[ J = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's determine the time it takes Ray to swim 1 mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:

1. **Initial Angle**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid.

3. **Total Movement**: Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun is the sum of the initial angle and the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks, we need to break down the information and perform the necessary calculations.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert this total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads at a rate of 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages per minute} \).
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

Now, we know the number of pages Judy read in the second week:
- In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages read over the two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Total pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Total pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To determine the number of sandwiches left after Cody and Trevor have eaten, we can apply basic principles of arithmetic and fractions. Given that Cody and Trevor initially had 12 sandwiches, we can calculate the number of sandwiches each person ate and then subtract these amounts from the total.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Together, they ate:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches} \]

"To solve the problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( N \) represent the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

We know that Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, in 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):

1. Distribute the 3 on the right side of the equation:
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

2. Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with \( N \):
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

Thus, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Given the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided:

1. Let \( R \) represent the number of goals Richie scored.
2. Let \( M \) represent the number of goals Mark scored.
3. Let \( A \) represent the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we know:
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: \( R = M + 20 \)
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: \( R = A + 45 \)
- Richie scored 80 goals: \( R = 80 \)

Using the value of \( R \):
- \( 80 = M + 20 \) implies \( M = 80 - 20 = 60 \)
- \( 80 = A + 45 \) implies \( A = 80 - 45 = 35 \)

The total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

"To address the issue with Maggie's oven, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply this percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting:

1. The set temperature is 450 degrees, and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.
2. The difference between the set and actual temperatures is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
3. The percentage error is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% error.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:
\[
1.04x = 520

   - Total cost on Amazon: \( 16 + 4 = 20 \) dollars

2. **Total cost on eBay:**
   - Cost of the boots: $13
   - Shipping cost: \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars (since the shipping cost on eBay is twice that of Amazon)
   - Total cost on eBay: \( 13 + 8 = 21 \) dollars

3. **Difference in total costs:**
   - Difference: \( 21 - 20 = 1 \) dollar

Thus, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"To solve the problem of determining how many days it will take for the beanstalk to exceed the height of Mark's window, we can use exponential growth principles. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles its height every day. The height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) can be expressed as:

\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( h(n) > 20 \) feet.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk for each day:

- Day 0: \( h(0) = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \text{ feet} \)
- Day 1: \( h(1) = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Day 2: \( h(2) = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \text{ feet} \)
- Day 3: \( h(3) = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \text{ feet} \)

On Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine the total grams of protein John consumes per week from mushrooms, we can use a straightforward calculation based on the given data:

1. **Determine the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms.
   - Protein content in 200 grams = \( \frac{200 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} \times 3 \text{ grams of protein} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \).

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so his daily protein intake from mushrooms is 6 grams.

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly protein intake = \( 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \).

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve the problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( J \) from both sides:

\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to cover the cost of his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental procedures and then determine the remaining amount he needs to pay after his deposit. Finally, we will calculate the number of hours he needs to work to earn this remaining amount.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base cost of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an additional cost of $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Given the problem, we can use the properties of a triangle to determine the measure of the largest angle. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

We can set up the equation for the sum of the angles:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we can find the measure of the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:
90"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide that by the cost of one gumball. Each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel).

First, let's convert the total amount of each type of coin into cents:
- Quarters: \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents
- Dimes: \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents
- Nickels: \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents
- Pennies: \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of money Colby has:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
\[ \frac{345 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents/gumball}} = 69 \text{ gumballs} \]

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. Upon increasing the weight by 50%, the new weight can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{New Weight} = 8 \, \text{pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \, \text{pounds}) = 8 \, \text{pounds} + 4 \, \text{pounds} = 12 \, \text{pounds} \]

Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, Jamaal decides to use a weight that is 2 pounds lighter:

\[ \text{Final Weight} = 12 \, \text{pounds} - 2 \, \text{pounds} = 10 \, \text{pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"To determine the total number of video games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into a series of steps, considering the initial number of games, the games he buys each month, and the games he receives for Christmas each year.

1. **Initial Games:**
   - Steve starts with 5 games from his birthday.

2. **Games Purchased:**
   - In the first year, he buys 1 game per month for 12 months:
     \[
     1 \text{ game/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ games}
     \]
   - In the second year, he buys 2 games per month for 12 months:
     \[
     2 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ games}
     \]
   - In the third year, he buys 4 games per month for 12 months:
     \[
     4 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ games}
     \]

3. **Games Received for Christmas:**
   - He receives 5 games each Christmas for 3 years:
     \[
     5 \text{ games/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ games}
     \]

4. **Total Number of Games:**
   - Adding all the games together:
     \[
     5 \text{ (initial)} + 12 \text{ (first year)} + 24 \text{ (second year)} + 48 \text{ (third year)} + 15 \text{ (Christmas)} = 104 \text{ games}
     \]

Thus, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is:

"To determine the additional hours required for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles, we first calculate the plane's speed. Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we use this speed to find the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa in pounds of chocolates per hour.

Ruiz's production rate is given as 120 pounds in two hours. Therefore, his hourly production rate is:
\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Marissa's production rate is 3/4 of Ruiz's two-hour production. Since Ruiz produces 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's hourly production rate is:
\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total production for each person over a 12-hour workday.

For Ruiz:
\[ \text{Ruiz's total production} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ \text{Marissa's total production} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both Ruiz and Marissa to find the combined total:
\[ \text{Total production} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow a systematic approach using the given data:

1. **Determine the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per mile is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Therefore, the total number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can handle by the number of rotations per year:
     \[
     \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the tire will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the given information:

- The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
- The directions recommend using 2 pumps per wash, which provides 120 washes.

First, we calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:
\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can use a straightforward calculation based on the rate of meat sold per hour and the total working hours per day.

Given:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- Prince works 10 hours a day.
- The bull weighs 750 kg.

First, we calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day:
\[ \text{Meat sold per day} = 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we determine how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat:

"To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to account for the pieces he chews and the pieces he gives away.

1. **Gum Chewing During School:**
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours.
   - The school day lasts 8 hours.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces he chews during school is:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Additional Gum Chewing:**
   - Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.
   - Jim chews 1 piece after dinner.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces he chews outside of school is:
     \[
     1 \text{ piece (on the way home)} + 1 \text{ piece (after dinner)} = 2 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Total Pieces Chewed:**
   - The total number of pieces Jim chews in a day is:
     \[
     4 \text{ pieces (during school)} + 2 \text{ pieces (outside school)} = 6 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Remaining Pieces Before Giving to Sister:**
   - Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum.
   - After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:
     \[
     20 \text{ pieces} - 6 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces}
     \]

5. **Gum Given to Sister:**
   - Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces given to his sister is:
     \[
     \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
     \]

6. **Final Number of Pieces Left:**
   - The number of pieces Jim has left at the end of the day is:
     \[
     14 \text{ pieces} - 7 \text{ pieces} = 7 \text{ pieces}
     \]

Thus, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. Thus, the number of cars towed each day for the last four days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the totals from both parts of the week, we get:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the height requirement to ride the roller coaster, we need to perform a few straightforward calculations.

1. **Convert the height requirement to inches:**
   The height requirement is 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the height requirement in inches is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the additional height Adam needs to grow:**
   Adam's current height is 40 inches. The additional height required is:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years required for Adam to grow the additional height:**
   Adam grows at a rate of 2 inches per year. Therefore, the number of years needed to grow 8 inches is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine James's earnings from his job selling used cars, we need to calculate the total sales, the cost of acquisition, the profit, and finally, his commission based on the profit.

1. **Total Sales Calculation:**
   James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000.
   \[
   \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Acquisition Cost Calculation:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   The profit is the total sales minus the total acquisition cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Commission Calculation:**
   James receives a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{James's Commission} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, James made $17,500.

"To solve this problem, we can apply basic principles of probability and percentages. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, we first calculate the number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ \text{Number of riders who can stay upright} = 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:

\[ \text{Number of women who can stay upright} = 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ \text{Number of men who can stay upright} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the total price for all three jewels, we need to calculate the individual prices of the gold, diamond, and silver jewels based on the given information.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond jewell is given as $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = \text{Price of a Diamond Jewell} + \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} + \text{Price of a Silver Jewell}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
   \]

The total price for all three jewels is \(4800\)."

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the concept of relative velocity. Here, Bob is moving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is moving at 70 miles per hour. The key is to determine the rate at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob.

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   The relative speed is the difference in their speeds, which is:
   \[
   70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
   \]

2. **Determine the time to close the gap:**
   The initial distance between Tom and Bob is 75 miles. To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"Given the relationships between the number of fish caught by Tommy, Darren, and Naomi, we can solve this problem step-by-step using basic algebra.

1. Let \( N \) represent the number of fish Naomi caught. According to the problem, \( N = 17 \).

2. Darren caught 6 fewer fish than Naomi. Therefore, the number of fish Darren caught, \( D \), can be expressed as:
   \[
   D = N - 6
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 17 \):
   \[
   D = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]

3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught, \( T \), can be expressed as:
   \[
   T = D + 3
   \]
   Substituting \( D = 11 \):
   \[
   T = 11 + 3 = 14

"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to analyze the cost distribution over the remaining classes he attends.

Given:
- Total cost for the classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10
- Maximum allowable cost per class: $10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he attends \( 10 - x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Thus, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate the number of customers each processes daily and then extend that to a weekly total.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes customers at twice the rate of Jewel, which means Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Since both work all 7 days of the week, we can calculate their weekly production as follows:

For Jewel:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

For Julie:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

Adding the weekly production of both:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided:

1. Let \( P \) represent the distance Paisley ran.
2. Let \( R \) represent the distance Reggie ran.
3. Let \( L \) represent the distance Lynn ran.

From the problem, we know:
- Paisley ran 4 miles: \( P = 4 \)
- Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran: \( R = 5P \)
- Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn: \( R = L + 3 \)

First, substitute the value of \( P \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Now, substitute the value of \( R \) into the equation \( R = L + 3 \):
\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

Solve for \( L \):
\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To solve this problem, we will break it down into a series of logical steps, applying basic principles of arithmetic and algebra.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats are half the sales from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800
     \]

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red hats and green hats:
     \[
     \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200
     \]

3. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, the sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:
     \[
     \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900
     \]

4. **Sum the total sales for both months:**
   - The total sales for both months are:
     \[
     \text{Total sales for both months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100
     \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[
2100

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori will need for her party, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required:**
   Each guest is expected to eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   \text{Total deviled egg halves} = 3 \times 16 = 48
   \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can calculate the number of whole eggs required by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.
   \[
   \text{Number of whole eggs} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the number of whole eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{24}{12} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture containing 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture containing 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound of almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep and \( G \) represent the number of geese. We can write the following equations:

1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, we solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

Next, we determine the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load capacity from the total weight:
\[ \text{Excess weight} = 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Thus, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the number of cookies each person has. Let \( C \) represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]

4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298
\]

Thus, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[
298

"To determine the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( L \) represent the original length of the dress in centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \). Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is given by:

\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. Thus, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To solve for \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To determine the total time Chris took to mow his lawn by using both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. **Determine the time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
     \[
     \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time to mow the entire lawn:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time taken in ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( T \) represent the age of one of the twins, and \( R \) represent the age of one of the triplets.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework. John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Adding these times together:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes (math)} + 40 \text{ minutes (reading)} + 20 \text{ minutes (history)} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting this time into minutes:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting the total homework time from the time before dinner gives us the time available for napping:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 80 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of the candies. Given that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40, we can calculate the total cost of the lollipops:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost gives us the cost of the four candies:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Thus, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then extend these to the total period.

First, let's calculate the monthly savings for each individual:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings can be calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total savings over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
\]

Now, we calculate the total savings for each individual over this period:
- Rong's total savings:
  \[
  20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
  \]
- Neil's total savings:
  \[
  28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
  \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:
\[
2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins}
\]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total cost of the services John's dog received at the vet. The dog needs two vaccines, each costing $20, and a heartworm check, which is 60% of the total bill.

Let's denote the total bill as \( T \).

The cost of the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To determine the total price of a crate of fresh fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs. The crate consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The prices are as follows:

- One apple costs $0.50.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

1. **Bananas:**
   - Number of bananas: 5
   - Cost per banana: $1.00
   - Total cost for bananas: \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars

2. **Apples:**
   - Number of apples: 12
   - Cost per apple: $0.50
   - Total cost for apples: \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars

3. **Oranges:**
   - Number of oranges: 7
   - Cost per orange: $3.00
   - Total cost for oranges: \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars

Finally, we sum the total costs for all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum these quantities. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Next, we sum the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine the number of additional chairs Mia needs to acquire for the function, we can follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs required:**
   - The function will have 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Each adult requires a regular chair, and each baby requires a high chair.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 15 \text{ (high chairs)} = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs currently available:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs currently available is:
     \[
     8 \text{ (high chairs)} + 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35

"To determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we can follow a structured approach:

1. **Initial Amount of Candy:**
   Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy.

2. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.
   - Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.

3. **Total Consumption Over Two Weeks:**
   - There are 14 days in two weeks.
   - Ginger's total consumption: \( 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \).
   - Amy's total consumption: \( 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \).

4. **Remaining Candy:**
   - Ginger's remaining candy: \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \).
   - Amy's remaining candy: \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \).

5. **Difference in Remaining Candy:**
   - The difference in the amount of candy between Amy and Ginger: \( 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \).

Thus, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"To determine the number of pizza slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by Bryce and his four friends and then subtract this from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices available:**
   Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   Bryce and two friends each ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas.
   \[
   \text{Slices eaten per person} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]
   Since there are 3 people:
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**

"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we start by converting the given length of Topher's shoe into inches. The length of Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert 8 feet to inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars separately and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- The number of windows smashed in the students' cars is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- The number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \) windows.

Finally, we sum the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

"Given the problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided:

- Let \( D \) represent Dora's age.
- Let \( F \) represent Dora's father's age.
- Let \( M \) represent Dora's mother's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Dora's age \( D = 15 \).
2. Dora's father's age \( F \) is eight more than twice Dora's age, so \( F = 2D + 8 \).
3. Dora's mother's age \( M \) is four years younger than Dora's father, so \( M = F - 4 \).

First, we calculate Dora's father's age:
\[ F = 2D + 8 = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age:
\[ M = F - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we start by calculating the votes for candidates A and B, and then subtract these from the total number of votes.

1. **Votes for Candidate A:**
   - Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for A = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. **Votes for Candidate B:**
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than Candidate A.
   - Votes for B = 20 votes (from A) + 50% of 20 votes = 20 + 0.50 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. **Votes for Candidate C:**
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris has:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck has:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

Thus, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To determine the amount of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Water used for giant cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

2. **Water used for medium cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

3. **Water used for small cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces.

4. **Total water used:**
   - Sum of water used for all cubes: \( 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \) ounces.

5. **Water left:**

"Given the problem, we can set up the relationships between the number of books each person has as follows:

- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
- Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( S + 6 \) books.
- Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so Clara has \( 2S \) books.

We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can write:
\[ 2S = 20 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know:
- Steven has 10 books.
- Alice has \( S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.
- Clara has 20 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To solve this problem, we first need to establish the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more expensive than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]

Substituting the given cost of a gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we sum these two amounts to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

"To determine Mark's profit from buying and selling the magic cards, we need to calculate both his total expenses and his total revenue, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total expenses:
- Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards, each costing $1800.
- Total expenses = 3 packs × $1800 per pack = $5400.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cards:
- He sells one card for $4000.
- He sells another card for $1000.
- He sells 30 additional cards, each worth an average of $50.
- Revenue from the 30 cards = 30 cards × $50 per card = $1500.
- Total revenue = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total expenses = $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26.
- The cost for each child is $12.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

The total cost for the first amusement park is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total cost for the first park} = (2 \times 26) + (2 \times 12) = 52 + 24 = 76 \]

For the second amusement park:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of cases of shingles required for each of the three houses, given the total number of cases and the relationships between the houses.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
- \( 2x \) as the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house (since the first house needs half of the second house).
- \( 2x \) as the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house (since the third house needs double the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles required for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distances covered both by driving and hiking, and then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but 1.5 hours were spent hiking. Therefore, the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - The driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = \text{Driving Time} \times \text{Driving Speed} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
   - Half the driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - The hiking time is 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = \text{Hiking Time} \times \text{Hiking Speed} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Driving Distance} + \text{Hiking Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}

"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to break down the scoring system and the given conditions.

1. **Scoring System:**
   - 10 points for each enemy jumped on.
   - 5 points for each berry collected.
   - 30 points for each second left on the timer when the level is completed.

2. **Given Conditions:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Let's define the variables:
- \( E \) = number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) = number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) = number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Using these variables, we can express the scores for both players:

**Emma's Score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5B \)
- Points from timer: \( 30T \)
- Total score for Emma: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)

**Ava's Score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
- Points from timer: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)
- Total score for Ava: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

**Difference in Scores:**
- Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
- Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)
- Difference: \( (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) = 25 \)

"Given that the total cost of four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas together cost 30 dollars, we can determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas by subtracting the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Cost of two pizzas} = \text{Cost of the remaining two pizzas} \]
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the remaining pizzas by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of each of the remaining two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the rides on the usual days and the rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This occurs for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
   - This occurs for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( y \).

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying 17 more fish, the total number of fish he bought is:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of white fish is:
\[ 4 + x \]

The total number of orange fish is:
\[ 3 + y \]

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, we can solve this system of equations. First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their respective hourly rates and then compute the difference in their earnings for 20 hours of work.

1. **Billy's Hourly Rate:**
   - Initial rate: $10.00 per hour.
   - After 2 months, Billy received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new rate: \(10.00 + 0.50 = 10.50\) dollars per hour.
   - On his first anniversary, Billy received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his new rate: \(10.50 + 1.00 = 11.50\) dollars per hour.

2. **Sally's Hourly Rate:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Therefore, Sally's hourly rate is: \(10.00 + 0.50 = 10.50\) dollars per hour.

3. **Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - Billy's earnings for 20 hours: \(11.50 \times 20 = 230\) dollars.
   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours: \(10.50 \times 20 = 210\) dollars.

4. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in their earnings for 20 hours of work is: \(230 - 210 = 20\) dollars.

Thus, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"To determine the total number of trees planted in Ashley's school reforestation campaign, we need to consider the contributions from both students and teachers. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Number of Students:**
   - The school has 40 classes.
   - Each class has an average of 25 students.
   - Total number of students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.

2. **Trees Planted by Students:**
   - Each student plants 1 tree.
   - Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees.

3. **Number of Teachers:**
   - Each class has 3 teachers.
   - Total number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.

4. **Trees Planted by Teachers:**
   - Each teacher plants 2 trees.
   - Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

5. **Total Number of Trees Planted:**

"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

The total number of current stuffed animals is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Thus, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down the problem into two parts: the hours played in the first two weeks and the hours played in the subsequent week.

1. **First Two Weeks:**
   - Kris plays for half an hour every day.
   - There are 14 days in two weeks.
   - Total hours played in the first two weeks: \(0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours}\).

2. **Subsequent Week:**
   - Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
   - There are 7 days in one week.
   - Total hours played in the subsequent week: \(2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours}\).

3. **Total Hours Played:**
   - Sum of the hours played in the first two weeks and the subsequent week: \(7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours}\).

4. **Hours Needed to Earn the Achievement:**
   - Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement.

"To determine the distance that will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we can use the basic formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
- The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.
- Both cars travel for 2 hours.

First, we calculate the distance each car travels:

For the first car:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second car:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"To determine the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the ratio of these two values.

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third grade: 340 out of 500 students passed.
   - Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 students passed.
   - Fifth grade: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth grade. The fourth grade's pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \). Therefore, the fifth grade's pass rate is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \). Thus, \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \) fifth graders passed.

2. **Calculate the total number of students who passed:**
   - Total passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students.

3. **Calculate the total number of students who took the test:**
   - Total students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.

4. **Calculate the overall pass rate:**

"To determine the length of the mosaic Milo can create, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips available:**
   Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, with each bag containing 72 chips.
   \[
   \text{Total chips} = 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine the area of the mosaic that can be covered with the available chips:**
   Each square inch of the mosaic requires 12 glass chips.
   \[
   \text{Total area} = \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height:**
   The mosaic is to be 3 inches tall. To find the length, we use the area formula for a rectangle:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Height} \times \text{Length}
   \]
   Solving for the length:
   \[
   \text{Length} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Height}} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To determine the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern described in the problem. The number of students doubles at the end of each month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year.

Let's break down the growth month by month:

1. **Initial number of students (beginning of January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

By the end of May, the number of students on campus is 320. To find the number of additional students who joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

\[
320 - 10 = 310
\]

Thus, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310.

     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
     \[
     6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Sum the total number of petals before any flowers are dropped:**
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of petals lost when one flower of each type is dropped:**
   - 1 flower with 5 petals:

"To determine the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends at the arcade, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses over the 4-hour period and then convert that into dollars.

First, let's establish the play time per quarter for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.

Next, we calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we sum the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \( 24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Given that the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 10z = 10 \]
Solving for \( z \), we find:
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \] ounces.

"Given the problem, we start by establishing the initial number of cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe initially has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and the number of cars he gave away from his initial total:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

In the second game, which was played at Julie's home court, Sasha's performance was affected, and she scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha's score in the second game was:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points} \]

To determine the total points Sasha scored over both games, we sum her scores from each game:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points} \]

Thus, the total points Sasha scored during both games is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
   - Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
   - Each package contains 11 tins.
   - Total tins of cat food = \( 8 \times 11 = 88 \) tins.

2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
   - Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
   - Each package contains 6 tins.
   - Total tins of dog food = \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) tins.

3. Find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food:
   - Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
   - Difference = \( 88 - 36 = 52 \) tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's denote the number of Magic Cards that PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can determine the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy collected during the Easter Egg Hunt, we can break down the problem into a series of simple calculations based on the given information:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs:
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs:
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs:
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs to find the total number:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = 5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Thus, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

"To determine the net financial impact of Milly's decision to return the book, we need to consider both the cost of shipping and the refund she will receive from Amazon. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Milly will lose:

"To determine the production quantity for the fourth week, we can break down the monthly production into the contributions from each of the four weeks. Given the monthly production and the production figures for the first three weeks, we can calculate the fourth week's production as follows:

1. **Monthly Production**: 50,000 bars
2. **First Week Production**: 8,000 bars
3. **Second Week Production**: \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
4. **Third Week Production**: \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Next, we sum the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Thus, the production for the fourth week is:

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours initially, and then for another 6 hours after a rest period. We can calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

For the first segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it will take for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel the same distance that three kangaroos can cover in 18 hours.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"Given the problem, we can use algebra to determine the number of clay dishes each person made and then sum them up.

Let \( K \) represent the number of dishes Kora made. According to the problem, Kora made 20 dishes:
\[ K = 20 \]

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora:
\[ R = K + 20 \]
Substituting \( K = 20 \):
\[ R = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory:
\[ J = 2R \]
Substituting \( R = 40 \):
\[ J = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Now, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[ J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 \]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all the sources of her funds and the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Initial Cost of the Laptop**: $600
2. **Trade-in Value**: $200
   - **Reduced Cost of the Laptop**: $600 - $200 = $400

3. **Erika's Part-time Job Earnings**: $150
4. **Money from Her Mom**: $80
5. **Total Additional Funds**: $150 + $80 = $230

6. **Amount Still Needed**: $50

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 230 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the reduced cost of the laptop:
\[ x + 230 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

- The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left.
- The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left.
- The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left.

First, we calculate the remaining length for each glue stick:

1. For the first glue stick:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick:
   \[

"Given the problem, we can start by defining the variables and relationships:

- Let \( J_s \) represent the number of socks Jack has.
- Let \( J_d \) represent the number of dishes Jack has.
- Let \( P_s \) represent the number of socks Peter has.
- Let \( P_d \) represent the number of dishes Peter has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack collected 60 dishes: \( J_d = 60 \).
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks: \( J_d = 2 \times J_s \).
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack: \( P_s = 2 \times J_s \).
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack: \( P_d = \frac{1}{2} \times J_d \).

First, we solve for \( J_s \):
\[
J_d = 2 \times J_s \implies 60 = 2 \times J_s \implies J_s = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]

Next, we solve for \( P_s \) and \( P_d \):
\[
P_s = 2 \times J_s = 2 \times 30 = 60
\]
\[
P_d = \frac{1}{2} \times J_d = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
\[
\text{Total socks} = J_s + P_s = 30 + 60 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Total dishes} = J_d + P_d = 60 + 30 = 90

"To determine the number of groups that can perform at the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide this by the time required for each group to perform, including setup and exit times.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Given a 10-minute intermission, the time available for performances is:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Each group requires:
\[ 2 \text{ minutes (on stage)} + 6 \text{ minutes (performance)} + 2 \text{ minutes (exit)} = 10 \text{ minutes/group} \]

To find the number of groups that can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year,
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, we need to convert the interest rate from dollars per year to a decimal form. Since the interest rate is 225 dollars per year, we can express it as a decimal by dividing by the principal:

\[ r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \]

Now, we can calculate the simple interest:

\[ I = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ I = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ I = 675 \]

Next, we add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ A = P + I \]
\[ A = 300 + 675 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"To address the problem, we need to calculate the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

1. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of these shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

2. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of these shirts have buttons.
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

3. **Difference Between the Two Quantities:**
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Thus, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

- 45 goats in Farm Y

He sold:
- 10 goats from Farm X
- Twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats

Now, we calculate the remaining goats in each farm:
- Goats left in Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\)
- Goats left in Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from each farm:
- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\)

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"To determine the average cost per pair of shoes that James pays, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total annual expenditure on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes.

First, we calculate the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \text{Pairs of shoes per year} = 2 \, \text{pairs/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 24 \, \text{pairs/year} \]

Next, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{2640 \, \text{dollars}}{24 \, \text{pairs}} = 110 \, \text{dollars/pair} \]

Thus, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow a straightforward calculation process:

1. **Determine the number of rooms to be cleaned:**
   - The total number of rooms is 90.
   - One-half of the rooms is:
     \[
     \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cleaning time in minutes:**
   - It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.
   - Therefore, the total time to clean 45 rooms is:
     \[
     45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Thus, the total time in hours is:
     \[

"To determine the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into a series of steps:

1. **First Year**: The town will build 12 homes.
2. **Second Year**: The town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
   \]
3. **Third Year**: The town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes}
   \]
   Doubling this amount for the third year gives:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes}
   \]

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years**: Adding the homes built in each year gives:

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to purchase, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required for his class. Given that there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to meet this demand. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only purchase whole packs, he must round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks. Therefore, he needs to buy:

\[ \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \text{ packs} \]

Thus, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure each student has 2 glue sticks.

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we can model the spread of the infection using exponential growth. Initially, there are 10 infected individuals, and each infected person infects 6 others every day. This can be represented by the formula:

\[ I(t) = I_0 \times (1 + r)^t \]

where:
- \( I(t) \) is the number of infected people at time \( t \),
- \( I_0 \) is the initial number of infected people,
- \( r \) is the rate of infection per day,
- \( t \) is the number of days.

In this scenario:
- \( I_0 = 10 \),
- \( r = 6 \) (since each infected person infects 6 others),
- \( t = 3 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ I(3) = 10 \times (1 + 6)^3 \]
\[ I(3) = 10 \times 7^3 \]
\[ I(3) = 10 \times 343 \]
\[ I(3) = 3430 \]

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is:

3430"
"To determine the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we start by calculating the total tips received by Rafaela. Given that each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, the total amount can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total tips received by Julieta, who received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total gives us Julieta's total tips:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

To find the combined total of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela is:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - Over 12 months, Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, meaning she earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - Over 12 months, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) badges per month.
   - Over 12 months, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 12-month period.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has, \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has, and \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

We are given the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs of all the items:
     \[
     10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Remaining Budget:**
   - Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
     \[
     65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Kelly has \(\boxed{5}\) dollars left in her budget."
"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the duration of her usual concerts in minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the total duration of the final concert is 65 minutes. This can be expressed as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

     2 \times 125 = 250 \text{ chimichangas}
     \]

3. **Total Production for the Three Days:**
   - Adding the production from Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday:
     \[
     250 \text{ (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500 \text{ chimichangas}
     \]

Thus, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is:

"Given the problem, we can use the relationships between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit to determine the speed of the whirligig.

1. Let the speed of the thingamabob be \( T \) meters per second.
2. The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, so the speed of the whatchamacallit is \( 11T \) meters per second.
3. We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   11T = 121
   \]
4. Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
5. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so the speed of the whirligig is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of notebooks Martha had. Given that after purchasing 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of notebooks Martha had} + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for the initial number of notebooks:

\[ \text{Initial number of notebooks Martha had} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, the number of notebooks Joseph had is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we start by calculating the distance Anis rowed. Given that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Distance Dijana rowed} \right) \]

Dijana rowed 50 miles, so:

\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) \]
\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \text{Distance Anis rowed} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

"To calculate the total amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can use the given ratios of material to masks.

First, for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required per small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the total material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required per large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the total material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material required for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"Given the problem, we can set up the following equations based on the information provided:

1. Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age.
2. Let \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

From the problem statement:
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.
- Duncan's current age is 60.

We can express these relationships mathematically as:
\[ D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ D = 60 \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the first equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires over a 30-day period, we start by calculating the total distance driven. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day for 30 days, the total distance is:

\[ 100 \, \text{miles/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 3000 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by the interval at which tune-ups are required:

\[ \frac{3000 \, \text{miles}}{1000 \, \text{miles/tune-up}} = 3 \, \text{tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he worked on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Next, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is:

"To determine the amount of allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total expenditure and then divide it by 2, as they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the total number of students participating in the various sports, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Tennis Players**: There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. **Volleyball Players**: The number of students playing volleyball is twice the number of tennis players. Therefore, the number of volleyball players is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).
3. **Soccer Players**: There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. The total number of soccer players is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Adding these numbers together gives us the total number of students:
\[ 6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \]

Thus, the total number of students is:
\[ 56 \]"
"To determine the profit raised by the class from selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Total Number of Lollipops Sold:**
   Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   \[
   \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Total Revenue:**
   Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can systematically calculate the number of each type of pet based on the given information:

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. **Fish**: He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
5. **Gerbils**: He has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
\[
3 \text{ (cats)} + 9 \text{ (dogs)} + 7 \text{ (rabbits)} + 21 \text{ (fish)} + 7 \text{ (gerbils)} = 47
\]

Thus, the total number of pets Larry has is:

"To determine how many days a loaf of bread will last given the consumption rates of Abby and Josh, we can use a simple calculation based on their daily consumption and the total number of slices in the loaf.

1. Abby consumes 2 slices of bread per day.
2. Josh consumes twice as much as Abby, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices per day.
3. Together, they consume \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

Given that the loaf contains 24 slices, we can calculate the number of days the loaf will last by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices consumed per day:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Slices consumed per day}} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
\]

Thus, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

"To determine the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months between her 5th and 10th birthdays and then multiply by the number of shells she collects each month.

Martha has been collecting shells for:
\[ 10 \text{ years} - 5 \text{ years} = 5 \text{ years} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months is:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Given that she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is:
\[ 60 \text{ months} \times 1 \text{ shell/month} = 60 \text{ shells} \]

"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we start by calculating the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint teas. Given that Lana has 27 cups in total and uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea, the remaining cups for chamomile and mint teas are:

\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

These 12 cups are divided equally into 3 rows. Therefore, the number of cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Since each row contains an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to consider the time it takes for each trip and the total time available.

1. **Calculate the number of trips in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

2. **Determine the number of berries per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If he makes 2 trips, he must pick up \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. Given that the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water and the tank is filled with half of this amount, the initial volume of water in the tank is:

\[ \text{Initial volume in the tank} = \frac{10,000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Therefore, the total volume of water used over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Volume used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining volume of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the volume used from the initial volume:

\[ \text{Remaining volume} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Summing these values gives us the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5):

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle covered and then find the difference between these distances.

First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we can use a simple arithmetic approach. We start by summing the quantities of the other toys:

- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

The total number of these toys is:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie's total number of toys after purchasing the bouncy balls is 62. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of other toys from the new total:

\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[

"To determine the number of new tables required for the yard sale, we first calculate the total number of boxes available. The charity group receives donations from 10 people, with each person contributing 5 boxes. Additionally, they already have 10 boxes in their possession. The total number of boxes is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total boxes} = (10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person}) + 10 \text{ boxes} = 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to accommodate these 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes. The number of tables needed is:

\[ \text{Tables needed} = \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. Therefore, the number of new tables required is:

\[ \text{New tables needed} = 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours. The hotel offers two options: a 12-hour stay for 1000 pesos or a 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos. After the initial 12 hours, the hotel charges an additional 70 pesos per hour.

First, we calculate the cost for the 12-hour stay plus the additional 5 hours:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

Thus, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

Next, we compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos. The amount Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we can break down the problem into two parts: the hay required for the goats and the hay required for the sheep.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Required:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

"To determine Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of crop and then sum these amounts. 

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.50.
   - Revenue from yams = 6 yams * $1.50/yam = $9.00.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.00.
   - Revenue from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2.00/sweet potato = $20.00.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Revenue from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.00.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Revenue from yams + Revenue from sweet potatoes + Revenue from carrots
   - Total earnings = $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00.

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells all her root crops.

"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps and calculate each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Swimming Distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Time for Initial Swimming:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Rest Time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Remaining Distance:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Speed for Remaining Distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Time for Remaining Swimming:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"Given the problem, we can set up the equation based on the information provided. If Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, and the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, we can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ \text{Bakery's loaves} = 7 \times \text{Sam's loaves} - 40 \]

Substituting the number of loaves Sam had:

\[ \text{Bakery's loaves} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

Calculating the expression:

\[ \text{Bakery's loaves} = 490 - 40 \]
\[ \text{Bakery's loaves} = 450 \]

"To determine the total commission Cayley earns from the sales of newspapers, we need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( B \) represent the points scored by Bahati, \( A \) represent the points scored by Azibo, and \( D \) represent the points scored by Dinar.

We are given the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From the second equation, \( A = B - 20 \).
- From the third equation, \( D = B - 10 \).

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the total sleep time Kim had on her bed, we need to account for the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Total Usual Sleep Time:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - This is a total of 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Time Spent Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \, \text{a.m.} - 2:15 \, \text{a.m.} = 23 \) minutes.

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time she woke up early is 5 minutes.

4. **Total Time Subtracted from Sleep:**
   - Total time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Total time woke up early: 5 minutes.

"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we start by calculating the initial number of occupied beds. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over the 2-week period. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

We then find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( A \).

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13

Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13

\[
S = 147

"To determine the total cost Pat will incur to fill her flower bed, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space required per plant, including the space between plants:**
   Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant. Therefore, the total space required per plant, including the space between plants, is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 111 feet long. The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required per plant:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   Pat already owns 17 flowers. The number of additional plants needed is:
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   Each plant costs $6. The total cost for 27 plants is:
   \[
   27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then see how much soil remains for the roses.

First, we calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the soil used for the carnations:
- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. We subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly savings for shoes and then extend that to an annual figure.

1. **Monthly Savings for Shoes:**
   Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly income for shoes.
   \[
   \text{Monthly Savings} = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Annual Savings for Shoes:**
   To find her annual savings, we multiply her monthly savings by the number of months in a year.
   \[
   \text{Annual Savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Number of Pairs of Shoes:**
   Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs she can buy, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.
   \[
   \text{Number of Pairs} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6
   \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine the total time required for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the process into two main tasks: peeling and sautéing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find the time required to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Rate of peeling}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find the time required to sauté 90 shrimp, we first determine the number of batches needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per batch}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to sauté, the total sautéing time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time required to complete both tasks is the sum of the peeling time and the sautéing time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To determine the final temperature change in the room, we can break down the problem into distinct phases and calculate the temperature change for each phase.

1. **Cooling on Low for 3 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature change is \( 2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees} \).

2. **Cooling on High for 4 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature change is \( 3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees} \).

3. **Warming Up for 2 Hours with No Air Conditioner:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature change is \( 2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees} \).

Next, we sum the temperature changes to find the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \( 6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees} \).
- Total warming: \( 4 \, \text{degrees} \).

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees} \).

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he first saw Comet Halley. Let's break down the information given and use it to find the solution.

1. **Age of Bill's Dad When He Saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.

2. **Age of Bill When He Saw Comet Halley a Second Time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Orbital Period of Comet Halley:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Age of Bill When He Saw Comet Halley for the First Time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can determine his age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, the age of Bill when he saw Comet Halley for the first time is:

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check and then sum these frequencies over the course of a year.

1. **Electric Bill Checks**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - Monthly frequency: 1 check
   - Annual frequency: \(1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}\)

2. **Gas Bill Checks**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - Monthly frequency: 1 check
   - Annual frequency: \(1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}\)

3. **Church Checks**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - Monthly frequency: 2 checks
   - Annual frequency: \(2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}\)

4. **Pest and Lawn Service Checks**: Buford writes one check per quarter for the pest and lawn service.
   - Quarterly frequency: 1 check
   - Annual frequency: \(1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}\)

Now, we sum the annual frequencies of all types of checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of flights the first plane makes to France in one day, given the distribution of its flights and the number of flights the second plane makes.

Let \( F \) represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day. According to the problem, the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4}F \]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Thus, the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each:
\[ \frac{1}{8}F \]

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Therefore, Igneous' howl duration is \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - The combined howl duration is the sum of the individual howl durations.
   - Combined howl duration = \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) + \( 60 \) seconds (Igneous) = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the Combined Howl Duration to Minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 120 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60.
   - Combined howl duration in minutes = \( \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"To determine Wilfred's age, we start by using the given information and applying basic algebraic principles.

Given:
- The total age of the four children is 20.
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we first calculate the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. Given that there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church received 15 cookies, the number of people in the church can be calculated by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon that each adult receives, we can set up a simple ratio based on the given conditions. Let \( x \) represent the size of each kid's slice. Since each adult's slice is twice the size of each kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the 2 adults and the 4 kids:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is thus \( 8x \).

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the following formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the amount of time Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments, and then subtract this from his total available time at the clinic.

1. **Time spent on rounds:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
   - Each round takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Time spent on appointments:**
   - Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on rounds and appointments:**
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert total time spent to hours:**
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. **Total available time:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 hours available.

6. **Time left for updating records:**

"To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines is 50. Given that the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population:
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. **Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population:**
   The initial population is 50. Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:
   \[
   \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow a series of calculations based on the given dimensions and the provided conversion and cost factors.

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   Substituting these values into the formula:
   \[
   V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company provided a conversion factor of 5.9 gallons per cubic foot. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
   \[
   G = V \times 5.9
   \]
   Substituting the volume:
   \[
   G = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \, \text{gallons/cubic foot} = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = G \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, accounting for the rate of discharge over time.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for the last 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Initial Charge Calculation:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

   \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   Janet works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000
   \]

4. **Determine the number of weeks required to save the down payment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. The prices and quantities are as follows:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Summing these amounts gives the total cost of the fruits already purchased:

\[
1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25
\]

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount he has is:

\[
10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75
\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

\[
\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3
\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of pieces of sweets in the box. Given that there are 15 packs and each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which amounts to:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Subtracting the pieces Anne kept from the total gives us the number of pieces she gave away:

\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

These 780 pieces were distributed equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the factor by which the price increases each year:

\[ 1 + r = 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this factor to the power of the number of years:

\[ (1.05)^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this factor by the initial price to find the future price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"To determine how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes, and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, calculate the earnings from the cookies:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 \text{ per cookie} = \$80 \]

Next, calculate the earnings from the cupcakes:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4 \text{ per cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, sum the earnings from both cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters \$10 each for helping her. Therefore, the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings to find the remaining amount:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

Thus, the amount of money Suzanne has left from her earnings is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we start by calculating the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Each twin found 30 eggs, so together they found:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Given that there were 100 eggs in total and 10 eggs were not found, the number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated as follows:
\[ 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the friends found 30 eggs.

"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes over a 30-day period, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the daily mining rate for a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the mining rate doubles: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the mining rate increases by 50% compared to the iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the daily mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, then 40 dwarves can mine: \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Determine the total mining rate over 30 days:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then over 30 days, they can mine: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the principle of proportionality. Given that the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich should remain constant across all package sizes.

Let's analyze the given packages:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3. The cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6. The cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the cost per sandwich is consistent at $1.5, we can use this rate to find the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:
\[
8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the various scenarios and their associated probabilities. We can break down the problem into a series of conditional probabilities and then use the law of total probability to find the final answer.

1. **Probability of a Substitute Teacher:**
   - \( P(\text{Substitute}) = 0.50 \)
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Probability of the Normal Teacher:**
   - \( P(\text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.50 \)
   - If the normal teacher is present, we need to consider the following sub-scenarios:
     - **Probability of an Extension for the Whole Class:**
       - \( P(\text{Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.40 \)
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
     - **Probability of No Extension for the Whole Class:**
       - \( P(\text{No Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.60 \)
       - If there is no extension for the whole class, we need to consider the probability that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment:
         - **Probability of a Personal Extension:**
           - \( P(\text{Personal Extension} \mid \text{No Extension}) = 0.20 \)
           - If Marcus gets a personal extension, he does not have to turn in his homework.
         - **Probability of No Personal Extension:**
           - \( P(\text{No Personal Extension} \mid \text{No Extension}) = 0.80 \)
           - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework.

Now, we can calculate the total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

\[
P(\text{No Homework}) = P(\text{Substitute}) + P(\text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) + P(\text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{No Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{Personal Extension} \mid \text{No Extension})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(\text{No Homework}) = 0.50 + 0.50 \times 0.40 + 0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20
\]

\[
P(\text{No Homework}) = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06
\]

\[
P(\text{No Homework}) = 0.76
\]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[
P(\text{Homework}) = 1 - P(\text{No Homework}) = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24
\]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

24%"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can distribute to their friends and family, we need to follow a straightforward calculation process:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family:**
   - Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000 seats
   - Seats allocated for graduates: 950 seats
   - Seats allocated for faculty: 300 seats

   \[
   \text{Seats for friends and family} = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of tickets each graduate can receive:**
   - Number of graduates: 950

   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750 \text{ seats}}{950 \text{ graduates}} = 5 \text{ tickets per graduate}
   \]

Thus, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to use the given relationships between the sizes of the jelly beans:

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.

First, we calculate the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \]

Next, we convert the number of medium-sized beans to the number of small beans:
\[ 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans} \]

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses for her jury duty, we can follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate Total Hours Worked:**
   Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 18 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 15 \, \text{USD/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 45 \, \text{USD}
   \]

3. **Calculate Total Expenses:**
   Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 3 \, \text{USD/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 9 \, \text{USD}
   \]

4. **Calculate Net Earnings:**
   Net earnings are the total earnings minus the total expenses.
   \[
   \text{Net earnings} = 45 \, \text{USD} - 9 \, \text{USD} = 36 \, \text{USD}
   \]

5. **Calculate Hourly Rate After Expenses:**
   The hourly rate after expenses is the net earnings divided by the total hours worked.
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{36 \, \text{USD}}{18 \, \text{hours}} = 2 \, \text{USD/hour}
   \]

Thus, Melissa's hourly pay after expenses is \(\boxed{2}\) USD/hour."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop the candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs for his king-sized bed, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:

"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we will calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, the post office delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their summer growth, we first need to convert all measurements to a consistent unit. Here, we will use inches for uniformity.

1. **Xavier's Initial Height:**
   - Xavier was initially 4 feet tall.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
     \[
     4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Xavier's Growth:**
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Xavier's new height is:
     \[
     48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Cole's Initial Height:**
   - Cole was initially 50 inches tall.

4. **Cole's Growth:**
   - Cole grew 2 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Cole's new height is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

Given:
- The second person received $80 more than the first person, so the second person received \( x + 80 \).
- The third person received twice what the second person received, so the third person received \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we can break down the problem into a series of steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Total days worked = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. **Determine the fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - The team worked 3/8 of a day each day.

3. **Convert the fraction of a day to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Hours worked each day = (3/8) * 24 hours/day = 9 hours/day.

4. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - Total hours worked by the team = 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours.

5. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - The team consists of 4 painters.
   - Hours worked by each painter = 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

Thus, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem statement:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3-year period from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. We can use the formula for exponential decay to find the final price:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can start by calculating the number of books in each of the other languages and then subtracting these from the total number of books.

1. **Total number of books**: 50
2. **Number of English books**: Since half of the books are in English, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25

"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive from San Diego, California, to New York City, New York, we start by calculating the total distance she has already covered. Given that Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, the total distance driven is:

\[ 325 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 1300 \, \text{km} \]

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find the remaining distance, we subtract the distance already driven from the total distance:

\[ 1955 \, \text{km} - 1300 \, \text{km} = 655 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum these costs.

1. **Tank top**: The cost is given as $10.
2. **Running shorts**: The cost is $5 more than the tank top, so the cost is $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis shoes**: The original price is $48, but they are on sale for half price, so the cost is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic socks**: The original price is $8, but Alison has a coupon for $2 off, so the cost is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we sum the costs of all the items:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( D \) represent the time in minutes that Donovan took to complete his part of the meal. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring produces one jellyfish per second.

1. **Convert the time period to seconds:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14,400 seconds

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish produced by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring produces 1 jellyfish per second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will produce 14,400 jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs:**
   - If one spring produces 14,400 jellyfish, then 5 springs will produce 5 * 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000.

"To determine the total time James took to reach the store, we need to consider the distances he walked and his walking speed.

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To determine the savings Jenny achieved by purchasing bananas in bunches rather than individually, we can follow a straightforward economic analysis.

First, we calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny purchased 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas.
- Therefore, the total number of bananas is \( 10 \times 4 = 40 \) bananas.

Next, we calculate the total cost if Jenny had bought the bananas individually:
- The cost per banana is $0.80.
- The total cost for 40 bananas is \( 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- The cost per bunch is $3.00.
- The total cost for 10 bunches is \( 10 \times 3.00 = 30 \) dollars.

Finally, we determine the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
- Savings = \( 32 - 30 = 2 \) dollars.

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches."
"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet:
   \[
   S + H = 100
   \]
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]
\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]
\[
S = 20
\]

Thus, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field at the end of a 6-hour workday, we can use a simple calculation based on the rates at which the farmer produces bales and the truck picks them up.

1. **Rate of Production by the Farmer:**
   - The farmer produces 5 bales of hay per hour.
   - Over a 6-hour workday, the total number of bales produced is:
     \[
     5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales}
     \]

2. **Rate of Pickup by the Truck:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour.
   - Over a 6-hour workday, the total number of bales picked up is:
     \[
     3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales}
     \]

3. **Net Number of Bales Left in the Field:**
   - The net number of bales left in the field is the difference between the total bales produced and the total bales picked up:
     \[
     30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales}
     \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field at the end of the 6-hour workday is 12.

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the time he spends in class and the additional time he spends on weekends.

First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a week. John has 6 periods a day plus 2 extra classes, making it 8 periods a day. He attends classes 5 days a week:

\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John also spends an additional \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on both Saturday and Sunday. The extra learning time for each day is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the extra learning time to the regular class time gives the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

"To determine the height the bouncy ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to follow a step-by-step approach using the given information:

1. **Initial Height Calculation:**
   - Each story in the mall is 24 feet high.
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Therefore, the initial height \( h_0 \) from which the ball is dropped is:
     \[
     h_0 = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **First Bounce Height Calculation:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce.
   - After the first bounce, the height \( h_1 \) is:
     \[
     h_1 = h_0 \times \frac{2}{3} = 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Second Bounce Height Calculation:**
   - After the second bounce, the height \( h_2 \) is:
     \[
     h_2 = h_1 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is 32 feet.

"To determine the height of the fourth child in inches, we can follow a step-by-step approach based on the given information:

1. **First Child's Height:**
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.
   - Converting feet to inches: \( 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Second Child's Height:**
   - The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child.
   - Therefore, the second child's height is \( 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Third Child's Height:**
   - The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   - Therefore, the third child's height is \( 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \).

4. **Fourth Child's Height:**
   - The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child.
   - Therefore, the fourth child's height is \( 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \).

Thus, the height of the fourth child is:
\[
72 \text{ inches}

"To determine the earnings of the apple orchard, we can use a straightforward calculation based on the number of apples sold and the price per bag. Given that the orchard sold 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we first calculate the number of bags sold:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the initial weight of the triceratops, we can work backwards from the information provided.

1. The Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kilograms of meat, which represents the remaining half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. Therefore, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, so the amount of meat left after the T-Rex is:
   \[
   540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the initial weight of the triceratops is:
   \[
   1080 \times 2 = 2160 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 2160 kilograms.

     \[
     \text{Area of one north/south wall} = 10 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total area of north and south walls} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
     \]

   - The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     \[
     \text{Area of one east/west wall} = 5 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} = 40 \, \text{square feet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total area of east and west walls} = 2 \times 40 \, \text{square feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
     \]

   - **Total area of all four walls:**
     \[
     \text{Total area} = 160 \, \text{square feet} + 80 \, \text{square feet} = 240 \, \text{square feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
     \[
     \text{Number of gallons needed} = \frac{240 \, \text{square feet}}{20 \, \text{square feet per gallon}} = 12 \, \text{gallons}

"To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we can use the basic formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- The speed of the first train is 60 miles per hour.
- The speed of the second train is half of the first train's speed, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.
- Both trains travel for 3 hours.

First, we calculate the distance each train travels:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \)

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

"To determine the length of each final cut of the ribbon, we can break down the problem into two steps:

1. **Initial Division**: The total length of the ribbon is 100 centimeters, and it needs to be divided into 4 equal parts. The length of each of these initial parts is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Length of each initial part} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Subsequent Division**: Each of these 25 cm parts must then be divided into 5 equal parts. The length of each of these final cuts is:
   \[
   \text{Length of each final cut} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 cm.

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we start by understanding the given information: 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. We can use this information to find the total number of students in the school.

Let \( T \) represent the total number of students in the school. According to the problem, 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To determine how many more female fish than male fish Tate has after his purchase, we can start by calculating the initial number of each type of fish and then add the new fish he buys.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfish
- 5 female goldfish

After purchasing additional fish, the new counts are:
- 2 more male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 1 more female guppy: 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 2 more male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfish
- 3 more female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfish

Now, we sum the total number of male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fish:

"To determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

1. **Calculate the production of the first two workers:**
   - Each of these workers produces 6 toys per hour.
   - Over a 10-hour shift, each worker produces \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \) toys.
   - Therefore, the two workers together produce \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) toys.

2. **Calculate the production of the next two workers:**
   - Each of these workers produces 4 toys per hour.
   - Over a 10-hour shift, each worker produces \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \) toys.
   - Therefore, the two workers together produce \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) toys.

3. **Total production by the four workers:**
   - The total number of toys produced by the four workers is \( 120 + 80 = 200 \) toys.

4. **Determine the total number of toys needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys to complete the order.
   - Therefore, the number of toys produced by the end of the shift is \( 400 - 20 = 380 \) toys.

5. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - The total production by all five workers is 380 toys.
   - The production by the four workers is 200 toys.
   - Therefore, the production by the fifth worker is \( 380 - 200 = 180 \) toys.

6. **Determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker:**

"To solve this problem, we can set up a series of equations based on the information provided.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis gave to Kris are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).

We can set up the equation:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we can use the principle of heat balance. When two different temperatures of water are mixed, the final temperature is a weighted average of the initial temperatures, weighted by the volumes of water.

Given:
- The temperature of the first mug of water, \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees.
- The volume of water from the first mug, \( V_1 = 4 \) ounces.
- The volume of water from the second mug, \( V_2 = 1 \) ounce.
- The final temperature of the mixed water, \( T_f \geq 40 \) degrees.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{V_1 \cdot T_1 + V_2 \cdot T_2}{V_1 + V_2} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We need \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens over the 21-day period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day by Milkie Cows Limited**: 20
3. **Number of days**: 21

   Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

4. **Total number of cows after three weeks**:
   50 initial cows + 420 added cows = 470 cows

5. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
6. **Chickens added per day by Broilers Limited**: 10
7. **Number of days**: 21

   Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided:

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
2. Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
3. Let \( R \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we know:
- Jim collected 27 seashells: \( J = 27 \)
- Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos: \( J = C + 5 \)
- Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey: \( C = 2R \)

First, substitute \( J = 27 \) into the second equation:
\[ 27 = C + 5 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 27 - 5 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

Next, substitute \( C = 22 \) into the third equation:
\[ 22 = 2R \]
Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ R = 11 \]

Now, we have the number of seashells each person collected:
- Jim: \( J = 27 \)
- Carlos: \( C = 22 \)
- Carrey: \( R = 11 \)

The total number of seashells collected is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Thus, each person got 20 seashells.

   - The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two complexes.
   - Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is \(400 \times 1.60 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:**
   - Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Total collections per week = \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\) collections.

4. **Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate:**
   - John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Total earnings per week = \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\) dollars.

Thus, John makes \(\boxed{1248}\) dollars in a week."
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the annual fruit production for each year from age 5 to age 10 and then sum these values.

1. **5-year-old tree**: The tree produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: The tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: The tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: The tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to determine the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree first.
5. **9-year-old tree**: The tree does not produce any fruits, so it produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: The tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

Next, we sum the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total length:

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the initial amounts of money that Ronnie and Rissa have. Ronnie is given $5, and Rissa is given three times as much, which is:

\[ \text{Rissa's initial amount} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gives to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, this amount is \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her initial amount. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to determine how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ \text{Ronnie's remaining amount} = 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we can start by breaking down the total amount of paint used and the distribution among the colors.

Given:
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.
- Half of the mural is yellow, which means 6 pints of yellow paint are used.
- The remaining half of the mural is divided equally among red, white, and purple paints.

First, calculate the amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors:
\[
12 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints (yellow)} = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

Since the remaining 6 pints are divided equally among red, white, and purple paints, we can determine the amount of each color:
\[
\frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3 \text{ colors}} = 2 \text{ pints per color}
\]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

   \[
   20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
   \[
   4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Area of the Living Room:**
   The living room is 5 times the area of one bedroom. Therefore, the area of the living room is:
   \[
   5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Area of the Rest of the House:**
   The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

4. **Total Area of the House:**
   The total area of the house is the sum of the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
   \[
   960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}

"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we can use a geometric progression where each term is double the previous term. The number of puffs on each day can be represented as follows:

- **Monday**: \(3\) puffs
- **Tuesday**: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs
- **Wednesday**: \(3 \times 2^2 = 12\) puffs
- **Thursday**: \(3 \times 2^3 = 24\) puffs
- **Friday**: \(3 \times 2^4 = 48\) puffs

The total number of puffs counted over the five days is the sum of this geometric series. The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series with the first term \(a\) and common ratio \(r\) is given by:

\[ S = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Here, \(a = 3\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 5\). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ S = 3 \frac{2^5 - 1}{2 - 1} \]
\[ S = 3 \frac{32 - 1}{1} \]
\[ S = 3 \times 31 \]
\[ S = 93 \]

Therefore, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:

"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the special size box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate the number of pods that can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

"To solve the problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach, ensuring each calculation is accurate and logical.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we can break down the problem into the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

Thus, the total number of goals scored in the match is:

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine Jim's current age, we can use the information provided and apply basic algebraic reasoning.

Given:
- John is currently 28 years old.
- 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.

First, let's determine John's age 20 years ago:
\[ \text{John's age 20 years ago} = 28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Let \( J \) represent Jim's age 20 years ago. According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim:
\[ 8 = 2J \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago:

"To determine the initial number of bandages the nurses' station started with, we need to account for the bandages used and ordered over the three days. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change in bandages: \( 50 - 38 = 12 \)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \( 38 - 10 = 28 \)
   - Bandages ordered: 0
   - Net change in bandages: \( -28 \)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) (half a pack)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs (100 bandages)
   - Net change in bandages: \( 100 - 25 = 75 \)

Now, let's calculate the total net change in bandages over the three days:
\[
12 - 28 + 75 = 59
\]

At the end of the third day, the nurses' station had 78 bandages left. To find the initial number of bandages, we need to subtract the total net change from the final number of bandages:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \( x \) represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge. According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is equal to 40. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating the variable. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Then, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

"To solve the problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the length of the shorter piece of the board. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \).

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Thus, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to sum the time taken for each side, considering the given conditions:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it does not add any additional time.

Now, let's calculate the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 2.5 \text{ minutes} + 2.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"Given the problem, we can start by defining the relationships between the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. Let's denote the number of helmets as \( H \), the number of robots as \( R \), and the number of footballs as \( F \).

From the problem statement:
1. The number of robots is half the number of helmets: \( R = \frac{H}{2} \).
2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs: \( H = \frac{F}{2} \).

We are given that there are 20 helmets, so \( H = 20 \).

Using the first relationship:
\[ R = \frac{H}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Using the second relationship:
\[ H = \frac{F}{2} \]
\[ 20 = \frac{F}{2} \]
\[ F = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of items:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

Thus, the total number of items Dominick saw is:

   \]

4. **Distance in Water**: 
   \[
   \text{Distance in Water} = \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]

5. **Speed in Water**: 
   \[
   \text{Speed in Water} = 10 \text{ yards per minute}
   \]

6. **Time in Water**: 
   \[
   \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

7. **Total Time**: 
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the total number of good seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seashells found by summing the individual counts:
   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found 432 seashells.
   - Benny found 86 seashells.
   - Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

2. Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total to find the number of good seashells:
   - Number of cracked seashells = 67.
   - Good seashells = Total seashells - Cracked seashells = 732 - 67 = 665.

Therefore, the number of good seashells they found together is 665.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day, so over 14 days, the total number of holes is:

\[ 6 \, \text{holes/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes per day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \, \text{holes/day} - 6 \, \text{holes/night} = 3 \, \text{holes/day} \]

To determine how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day, we use the following calculation:

\[ \frac{84 \, \text{holes}}{3 \, \text{holes/day}} = 28 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

We can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the 4 tables and then determine how many screws will be left over from the 40 screws James has.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg requires 2 screws.
3. Therefore, the number of screws required for one table is \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws will be left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:

"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls for the carnival, we need to calculate the individual contributions and then sum them up.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, which means Kim raised \(430 + 320 = 750\) dollars.
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, which means Maryam raised \(300 + 400 = 700\) dollars.

Now, we sum the amounts raised by each girl:

\[
430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180
\]

Thus, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, we calculate Aaron's speed:
- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

Next, we determine Vanessa's speed:
- Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
- Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we start by calculating the required line based on the given ratio and the length of the dock. The caretaker requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Given that the dock is 200 feet long, the total line required is:

\[ 3 \text{ feet/foot} \times 200 \text{ feet} = 600 \text{ feet} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To determine the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to break down the components of the revenue and then aggregate them over the specified period.

1. **Revenue per Reservation:**
   - Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each, totaling \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
   - Each reservation also includes a $5 bottle of wine.
   - Therefore, the total revenue per reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Nightly Revenue:**
   - The restaurant receives 6 reservations per night.
   - Thus, the total revenue per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

3. **Weekly Revenue:**
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly revenue is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

The total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we need to follow a series of steps to calculate the total revenue and then the price per unit. Here’s the detailed process:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**
   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Determine the total profit:**
   - The profit margin is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of the individuals involved and then calculate the future age of John's youngest son.

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the rate at which each person peels oranges and then compare the total number of oranges peeled by each over the 60-minute period.

1. **Calculate Ana's peeling rate:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour (60 minutes) is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate Jane's peeling rate:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour (60 minutes) is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after one hour is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the total cost Mark incurred for the radiator and its installation, we need to break down the expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of the Radiator:**
   - Original price of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of Mechanic's Labor:**
   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of labor
   - Total cost: \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To determine the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm, we can use a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows. We know the following:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + k = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   2c + 4k = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
c + k = 20 \\
c + 2k = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[
(c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
k = 15
\]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
\[
c = 5
\]

Thus, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is \( 5 \).

"To determine how many slices each person can have, we start by calculating the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Each pizza is divided into 8 slices:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. There are 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends):

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.
