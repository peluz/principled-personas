"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, totaling 7 eggs used daily. 

To find the number of eggs remaining for sale, we subtract the eggs used from the total eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Each of these 9 eggs is sold for $2. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of eggs by the price per egg:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a structured approach, focusing on the initial investment, the value increase, and the final sale price.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total initial investment: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Value Increase:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.
   - 150% of $80,000 is calculated as: \( 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \)
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is: \( 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \)

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total initial investment.
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Thus, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To determine the total meters James runs in a week, we can use multiplication to combine the number of sprints, the distance of each sprint, and the frequency of his training sessions.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can break down the problem into a few clear steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens:**
   - Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi has 20 chickens.
   - Therefore, the total daily feed requirement is:
     \[
     20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of feed already given:**
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   - Therefore, the total feed given so far is:
     \[
     15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - The total daily feed requirement is 60 cups.
   - The total feed already given is 40 cups.
   - Therefore, the feed needed for the final meal is:
     \[
     60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
     \]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.
- The cost for one pair is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

Kylar is buying 16 glasses, which is equivalent to 8 pairs:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]"
"Given the problem, we start by identifying the relationships between the number of sheep in each city:

- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ \text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download a 200 GB file, considering the interruption and restart, we need to break down the process into distinct phases:

1. **Initial Download Phase:**
   - Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart Phase:**
   - The Windows update forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarted Download Phase:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The time to download the full 200 GB file again is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

Adding these times together gives the total time:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to break down the problem into segments and calculate the distances for each segment.

1. **Initial Trip Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance traveled: \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \).

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next 0.5 hours, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance traveled: \( \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \).
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance traveled: \( \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \).

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   - Total distance back home: \( 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \).

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   - Distance from home: \( 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \).

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular and overtime components.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, which means she worked 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings Calculation:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we will calculate the downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - Downloads in the second month = \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - To find the reduction, we calculate 30% of 180:
     \[
     0.30 \times 180 = 54
     \]
   - Downloads in the third month = \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - Total downloads over the three months = Downloads in the first month + Downloads in the second month + Downloads in the third month.
   - Total downloads = \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to perform a break-even analysis. This involves calculating the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost.

1. **Initial Cost (Fixed Cost)**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost (Variable Cost)**: $3

The net annual profit can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost} = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \]

To find the break-even point, we set up the equation where the total revenue equals the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} \times \text{Number of Years} = \text{Initial Cost} \]
\[ 7.5 \times \text{Number of Years} = 90 \]

Solving for the number of years:
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given, using our expertise in fractions and algebra. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Final Count:**
   Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after all sales.

2. **Sales at the Orange House:**
   She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Let \( y \) be the number of vacuum cleaners left before the orange house sales. Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{y}{2} = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10
   \]
   So, she had 10 vacuum cleaners before the orange house sales.

3. **Sales at the Red House:**
   Before the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners. She sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house. Let \( z \) be the number of vacuum cleaners left before the red house sales. Therefore:
   \[
   z - 2 = 10
   \]
   Solving for \( z \):
   \[
   z = 12
   \]
   So, she had 12 vacuum cleaners before the red house sales.

4. **Sales at the Green House:**
   Before the red house, she had 12 vacuum cleaners. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with. Therefore:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem into a series of multiplications and conversions:

1. **Daily Egg Consumption**: Claire makes a 3-egg omelet each morning.
2. **Total Days in 4 Weeks**: There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) days.
3. **Total Eggs in 4 Weeks**: Multiply the daily consumption by the total number of days: \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs} \).
4. **Convert Eggs to Dozens**: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert 84 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: \( 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa must maintain for the remaining part of her hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time required to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the 12-mile trail:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles, totaling 2 hours so far. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop. 

The first stop was at 20 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which places it at 45 miles (60 - 15 = 45).

Now, subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots.

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33.
The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \] dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed as:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the system of equations based on the given ratio and the total age.

Let \( D \) represent Darrell's age and \( A \) represent Allen's age. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, and their total age is 162. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \)
2. \( D + A = 162 \)

From the first equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):

\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

Next, substitute \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the second equation:

\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]

\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Multiply both sides by 11 to clear the fraction:

\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Solve for \( A \):

\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]

\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
2. Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

This translates into the following system of equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the value of \( S \), we can substitute it back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

   A = \frac{R}{2} + 5
   \]

3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron:
   \[
   S = A - 2
   \]

First, substitute \( R = 40 \) into the equation for \( A \):
\[
A = \frac{40}{2} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to use the formula for speed, which is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:

- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up and solve a system of equations involving rates, distances, and time. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the rates:**
   - Let \( w \) be Dana's walking speed in miles per hour.
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk, so her running speed is \( 4w \).
   - Dana can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run, so her skipping speed is \( \frac{4w}{2} = 2w \).

2. **Given information:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, \( 2w = 3 \).

3. **Solve for \( w \):**
   \[
   2w = 3 \implies w = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the running speed:**
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 4w = 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

6. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

7. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

8. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to apply multiplication and subtraction to the given distances. 

First, we calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when she holds the sapphire gemstone. Normally, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times this distance:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. We subtract this distance from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased as \( x \).

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

2. Add 140 to both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ x - 140 + 140 = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of blue ties as \( B \) and the number of red ties as \( R \).

1. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
\[ R = 2B \]

2. The cost of each blue tie is $40, and John spent $200 on blue ties:
\[ 40B = 200 \]

From the second equation, we can solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Now, using the first equation, we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 2B = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties:
\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:
\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = R \times \text{Cost of each red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}

"To solve the problem, we recognize that the square footage of each level of the sandcastle forms a geometric series. The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it. This means the common ratio \( r \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

The levels from top to bottom are:
- 4th level: \( 16 \)
- 3rd level: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
- 2nd level: \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)
- 1st level: \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \)

The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]
where \( a \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( n \) is the number of terms.

Here, \( a = 128 \), \( r = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( n = 4 \).

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ S_4 = 128 \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S_4 = 128 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{16}}{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S_4 = 128 \frac{\frac{15}{16}}{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S_4 = 128 \times \frac{15}{16} \times 2 \]
\[ S_4 = 128 \times \frac{15}{8} \]
\[ S_4 = 16 \times 15 \]
\[ S_4 = 240 \]

The total square footage of all levels is 240. To find the average square footage per level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is:

1. Cindy has 4 pets: \( C = 4 \).
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy: \( M = C + 2 \).
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia: \( J = 3M \).

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[ M = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Next, substitute the value of \( M \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[ J = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has:
\[ \text{Total pets} = C + M + J = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J \) represent Jackson's age.
2. Let \( A \) represent Amy's age.
3. Let \( C \) represent Corey's age.
4. Let \( M \) represent James's age.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
- James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
- James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

First, we can use the information about James and Corey to find Corey's age:
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can find Amy's age using the second equation:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, we can find Jackson's age using the first equation:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation involving percentages to find Gerald's new time after his speed improvement.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( G \) be Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
   - Lee's time to run the 400-meter hurdles is given as 38 seconds.
   - According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     G = 38 + 2
     \]
     \[
     G = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the improved time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%. This means he can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 90% of his original time.
   - We can express this as:
     \[
     \text{Improved time} = G \times 0.90
     \]
   - Substituting \( G = 40 \) seconds into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Improved time} = 40 \times 0.90
     \]
     \[
     \text{Improved time} = 36 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables as follows:

- \( d \) = number of dogs
- \( c \) = number of cats
- \( r \) = number of rabbits

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The number of cats is twice the number of dogs:
   \[
   c = 2d
   \]

2. The number of dogs is 60:
   \[
   d = 60
   \]

3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
   \[
   r = (d + c) - 12
   \]

First, substitute the value of \( d \) into the equation for \( c \):
\[
c = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, substitute the values of \( d \) and \( c \) into the equation for \( r \):
\[
r = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
\]

Now, we can find the total number of pets by summing the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = d + c + r = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
\]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
348

   \]

2. Next, calculate the number of girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

3. Now, find the number of girls in the girl scout:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
   \]

4. Finally, calculate the number of girls not in the girl scout:

"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by calculating the duration of James' sleep. Given that James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can find James' sleep duration as follows:

\[ \text{James' sleep} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept to find the difference:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the volume of tomatoes before and after cooking, and how this affects the number of tomatoes used.

1. **Volume Reduction**: When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, the volume is reduced by half. This means the initial volume of tomatoes is twice the volume of the sauce produced.

2. **Volume of Sauce**: Freda made 32 ounces of sauce. Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking was:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Volume per Can**: Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume of tomatoes by the volume per can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of cars and use subtraction to find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

1. We start with the total number of cars initially on the motorway: 30 cars.
2. We know that 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. Therefore, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \) cars.
4. Out of these 25 cars, 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
5. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through: \( 25 - 20 = 5 \).

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Plants:**
   Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. We can calculate the total number of plants she initially has by multiplying the number of plants per ledge by the number of ledges:
   \[
   2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}
   \]

2. **New Plants Received:**
   Mary received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. We add these to the initial number of plants:
   \[
   80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. **Plants Given Away:**
   Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. We calculate the total number of plants she will give away by multiplying the number of plants given per ledge by the number of ledges:
   \[
   1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
   \]

4. **Final Number of Plants:**
   To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants she has:
   \[
   98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, let's set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

Here, \( x \) is the number of minutes it will take to cover 42 miles. We can solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:

\[
3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ miles} \times 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
3x = 420

"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of a single box, taking into account the thickness of the walls. Each box has an outer dimension of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, with walls that are 1 inch thick.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the inner dimensions:**
   - **Length:** The outer length is 5 inches. Subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) for the wall thickness: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches.
   - **Width:** The outer width is 6 inches. Subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) for the wall thickness: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches.
   - **Height:** The outer height is 4 inches. Subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) for the wall thickness: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches.

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The inner volume is given by the product of the inner dimensions: \(3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ cubic inches}\).

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all three boxes:**

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up a system of equations based on the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.

From the problem, we know the following:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( 0.5x \) hours (since each episode is 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV over the week is 7 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[ x = 3 \]

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. According to the problem:

1. Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
2. He actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
3. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]
\[ 2x = 115 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{2} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she originally purchased and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the new selling prices, which have increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120

"To solve the problem of finding the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can leverage the given ratio and the total amount of the mixture. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13, and the total amount of the mixture is 120 units.

1. **Understand the ratio:**
   - The ratio 7:13 means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.
   - The total parts in the ratio are \( 7 + 13 = 20 \).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the common factor for the ratio.
   - The amount of sugar used is \( 7x \) teaspoons.
   - The amount of water used is \( 13x \) cups.
   - The total amount of the mixture is \( 7x + 13x = 20x \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We know that \( 20x = 120 \).
   - Dividing both sides by 20, we get \( x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \).

4. **Calculate the amount of sugar:**
   - The amount of sugar used is \( 7x \).

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine Lylah's salary four years ago, given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

1. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:**

   Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. According to the problem, Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.30L
   \]
   \[
   40000 = 1.30L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \approx 30769.23
   \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**

   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:
   \[
   \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 = 56000
   \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**

   Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%) as Adrien's:
   \[
   \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23
   \]
   \[
   \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 = 43076.92
   \]

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**

   \[
   \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92
   \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To solve this problem, we need to apply our knowledge of multiplication to determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month.

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper each week. Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. Therefore, the number of sheets he uses per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of sheets used in a month as follows:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Thus, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

"To calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to consider her varying speeds over different time intervals.

1. **First 3 hours:**
   - Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Next 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie's speed decreases to 5 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the next 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total distance:**
   - The total distance covered in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in each segment:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles.

1. Julia bought \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband bought 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had 12 spoons left.

We can write the equation for the total number of spoons after her husband's contribution and before using any for sampling:
\[ x + 5 \]

After using 3 spoons, the number of spoons left is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 \]

We know that this equals 12:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( p \) be the cost of one pepper.
- Let \( w \) be the cost of one watermelon.
- Let \( o \) be the cost of one orange.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs:
   \[
   w = 3p
   \]

2. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon:
   \[
   o = w - 5
   \]

3. Each pepper costs 15 dollars:
   \[
   p = 15
   \]

Using these equations, we can substitute the value of \( p \) into the other equations to find \( w \) and \( o \):

\[
w = 3p = 3 \times 15 = 45
\]

\[
o = w - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- Dillon buys 4 watermelons:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4w = 4 \times 45 = 180
  \]

- Dillon buys 20 peppers:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20p = 20 \times 15 = 300
  \]

- Dillon buys 10 oranges:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10o = 10 \times 40 = 400
  \]

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[
\boxed{880}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:
- \( Q \) for the number of queens,
- \( B \) for the number of baby bees,
- \( W \) for the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The total number of bees is 700:
   \[

"To solve this multi-step arithmetic word problem, let's break it down step by step, focusing on the fractions and multiplication involved:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then determine the amount of money given to the cashier by adding the change received to the total cost.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.

First, we add the cost of the adult ticket and the child ticket:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change. To find out how much she gave the cashier, we add the change to the total cost of the tickets:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a single-variable linear equation based on the information given.

Let \( D \) represent the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends.
- Therefore, \( 3D = 12 \).

We can solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we know Dorothy has 4 friends. 

Next, we are told that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of friends James has is:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim based on their respective distances and speeds.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home using their speeds:
- Steve's speed: 440 feet per minute
- Tim's speed: 264 feet per minute

For Steve:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the concept of compound interest. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Initial Price:**
   - \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars

2. **Increase Rate:**
   - The price increases by 20% every two months, which can be expressed as a multiplier of 1.20.

3. **Number of Periods:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of periods in 36 months is:
     \[
     n = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
     \]

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price \( P \) after 18 periods can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
     \[
     P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
     \]
     where \( r \) is the rate of increase per period (0.20) and \( n \) is the number of periods (18).

5. **Substitute the values:**
   \[
   P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculate the final price:**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
     \[
     P = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age and \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we have \( B = 8 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = 2B \]

"To determine the total time Billy will need to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time required for both peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is:
  \[
  1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is:
  \[
  5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds}
  \]

To convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:
  \[
  300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we add the peeling and cutting times together to get the total prep time:
- Total prep time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
   - Let \( R \) be the total revenue.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost.
   - Let \( P \) be the profit.

2. **Given information:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - They made a profit of $25.

3. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total cost \( C \) is given by the number of gallons \( G \) times the cost per gallon: \( C = 5G \).
   - The total revenue \( R \) is given by the number of gallons \( G \) times the revenue per gallon: \( R = 10G \).
   - The profit \( P \) is the total revenue minus the total cost: \( P = R - C \).

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the total number of Chinese participants in the race. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, we can find the number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese from the total number of Asians:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

This means there are 160 Chinese participants. Next, we need to determine the number of girls on the Chinese team. We know that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow a series of arithmetic steps involving fractions and subtraction. Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = 2500 - 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( B \) represent the number of crabs Bo has.
- \( M \) represent the number of crabs Monic has.
- \( R \) represent the number of crabs Rani has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Bo has 40 crabs:
   \[
   B = 40
   \]
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo:
   \[
   M = B - 4
   \]
3. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic:
   \[
   R = M + 10
   \]

First, substitute the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[
M = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

Next, substitute the value of \( M \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[
R = 36 + 10 = 46
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of crabs the three have together:
\[
B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

"To calculate Lloyd's earnings, we need to apply the principles of multiplication and addition. For the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour. Multiplying these values, we get:

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours at the same rate. Again, we multiply:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total earnings for the first two weeks, we add the amounts from each week:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks.

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we start by calculating the number of votes the winner received. Given that the winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes and the total number of votes is 80, we can calculate the winner's votes as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Next, we subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. According to the problem:

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations:
   \[
   R = 4C
   \]
   where \( R \) is the number of red roses.

2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations:
   \[
   200 = 5C
   \]

First, solve the second equation for \( C \):
\[
C = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 40 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[
R = 4 \times 40 = 160

"To solve the problem, we will set up a system of linear equations based on the given information and solve for the unknowns.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: 
     \[
     J = M + 2
     \]
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     M - 2 = 14 + 5
     \]

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   \[
   M = 19 + 2
   \]
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 21 + 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 23
   \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning margin between the two teams in the 4 by 400 meter relay, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the race and then find the difference between these times.

**Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team):**
- Each of the four members runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team 1: \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so they complete it in \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they complete it in \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they complete it in \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds.
- Total time for Team 2: \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in their total times:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \]

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of these two independent events and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine the relative likelihood of the two events.
To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"
"Given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many, we can calculate the total number of apples they picked together using multiplication and addition. First, we find the number of apples Jenna picked by multiplying the number of apples her mother picked by 1/2:

\[ \text{Jenna's apples} = 20 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked to find the total:

\[ \text{Total apples} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of apples they both picked is 30.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables and equations step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of rats is \( 3r \) (since there are 3 cages).
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw for the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total straw for the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
   - The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   \[
   18r + 50 + 20 = 160
   \]

4. **Simplify and solve for \( r \):**
   \[
   18r + 70 = 160
   \]
   \[
   18r = 160 - 70
   \]
   \[
   18r = 90
   \]
   \[
   r = \frac{90}{18}

   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A.
- \( y \) as the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher B.
- \( p_A \) as the payment per sentence from Publisher A.
- \( p_B \) as the payment per sentence from Publisher B.

From the problem, we know:
1. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
2. He edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher.
3. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
4. Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays.

First, we can set up the equation for the total number of sentences:
\[ x + y = 1000 \]

Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher:
\[ x = y \]

Given that Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence:
\[ p_A = 5 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays:
\[ p_B = 2 \times p_A = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from each publisher:
- Earnings from Publisher A:
\[ \text{Earnings}_A = x \times p_A = 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

- Earnings from Publisher B:
\[ \text{Earnings}_B = y \times p_B = 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, the total earnings for the week are:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings}_A + \text{Earnings}_B = 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, we sum up all the cheese used:
- Total cheese used: \( 14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 31 \text{ slices} \).

Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:

"To determine the total number of pens Janet has, we need to perform a series of additions and multiplications. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Green Pens**: Janet initially has 22 green pens.
2. **Yellow Pens**: Janet initially has 10 yellow pens.
3. **Blue Pens**: Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens. Therefore, the total number of blue pens is:
   \[
   6 \times 9 = 54
   \]
4. **Red Pens**: Janet bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

Next, we add all the pens together:
\[
22 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (yellow)} + 54 \text{ (blue)} + 12 \text{ (red)} = 98
\]

Thus, Janet has a total of 98 pens.

"To solve for the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can use the concept of weighted averages and solve for the unknown score.

1. **Identify the lowest score among the first five tests:**
   - Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
   - The lowest score is 71.

2. **Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores:**
   - Sum of the remaining scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

3. **Determine the total sum needed for an average of 93 with five tests:**
   - The average of 93 with five tests means the total sum of the five highest scores should be \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \).

4. **Set up the equation to find the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The sum of the five highest scores (including the sixth test) should be 465.
   - Therefore, \( 367 + x = 465 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = 465 - 367 \)
   - \( x = 98 \)

Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum these weights.

1. **Weight of the Chocolate Bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 * 40 grams = 1000 grams.

2. **Weight of the Candied Apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 * 20 grams = 1600 grams.

3. **Total Weight of the Bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples = 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given:

1. Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Each plate costs $6000.

First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:
\[ 20 \text{ dozen} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, calculate the cost of each cup:
\[ \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and then determine how much more money she needs to earn to afford them. We will also consider her current savings and the earnings from her various activities.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and the shoes:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\).

Adding the cost of the jacket and the shoes:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Next, we consider Sara's current savings:
- Sara already has $10 saved.

Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Now, let's calculate her earnings from babysitting:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits.
- She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we use the fact that she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn:
\[ \text{Number of times to mow the lawn} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( R \) represent the number of red chickens and \( W \) represent the number of white chickens.

We know the following:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the following system of equations:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]
\[ W = R + 2 \]

First, substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the first equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Next, simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Gary to walk this distance. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Given:
- Distance \( d = 15 \text{ miles} \)
- Speed \( v = 3 \text{ miles/hour} \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in addition and subtraction to determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can set up the equation to find the number of customers on the third day:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
5. Subtract 250 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given conditions. Let \( S(t) \) represent the amount of water in the small pool at time \( t \) (in minutes), and \( B(t) \) represent the amount of water in the big pool at time \( t \).

Given:
- Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

We can express the rates of change of the water levels in the pools as:
\[ \frac{dS}{dt} = -4 \]
\[ \frac{dB}{dt} = -4 \]

Since the pools are leaking at a constant rate, the amount of water in each pool at any time \( t \) can be expressed as:
\[ S(t) = S_0 - 4t \]
\[ B(t) = B_0 - 4t \]

where \( S_0 \) and \( B_0 \) are the initial amounts of water in the small and big pools, respectively, at time \( t = 0 \).

Given the conditions:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B(t-4) = 2S(t-4) \]
\[ B_0 - 4(t-4) = 2(S_0 - 4(t-4)) \]
\[ B_0 - 4t + 16 = 2(S_0 - 4t + 16) \]
\[ B_0 - 4t + 16 = 2S_0 - 8t + 32 \]
\[ B_0 + 16 = 2S_0 + 32 - 4t \]
\[ B_0 + 16 = 2S_0 + 32 - 4t \]
\[ B_0 = 2S_0 + 16 \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B(t) = 4S(t) \]
\[ B_0 - 4t = 4(S_0 - 4t) \]
\[ B_0 - 4t = 4S_0 - 16t \]
\[ B_0 = 4S_0 - 12t \]

We now have two equations:
\[ B_0 = 2S_0 + 16 \]
\[ B_0 = 4S_0 - 12t \]

Since \( t = 0 \) at the current time, we can equate the two expressions for \( B_0 \):
\[ 2S_0 + 16 = 4S_0 \]
\[ 16 = 2S_0 \]
\[ S_0 = 8 \]

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S(t) = S_0 - 4t \]
\[ S(0) = 8 - 4(0) \]
\[ S(0) = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Lori wants to buy and then determine how many hours she needs to work to earn that amount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt:
- Cost of the shoes: $320.00
- Cost of the belt: $32.00

Total cost:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. She earns $8.00 per hour, so we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, including the 10% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount she will pay over the 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Amount Due
Janeth borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay an additional 10% interest.

The interest amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount due is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount Paid
Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months.

The total amount paid over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Balance
The remaining balance is the total amount due minus the total amount paid:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to add the number of roses to the number of dahlias. We start by identifying the number of each type of flower:

- There are 4 roses.
- There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias together to find the total number of flowers in the vase:

4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack using the given relationships and Harriet's current age.

1. Let \( H \) represent Harriet's current age. We are given that \( H = 21 \).
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   A = 3H = 3 \times 21 = 63
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   H = \frac{Z}{2} \implies Z = 2H = 2 \times 21 = 42
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24
   \]
2. Adrian's age in three years:
   \[
   A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66
   \]
3. Zack's age in three years:
   \[
   Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45
   \]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we use the formula for the average of a set of numbers:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{(H + 3) + (A + 3) + (Z + 3)}{3} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest after two weeks, we will follow a step-by-step approach using percentages and fractions.

1. **Initial Harvest:**
   - The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
   - 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited.
   - Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest:
     \[
     0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready for harvest at this point:
     \[

"To determine the total cost Mark pays for the fleet of 12 cars, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees step by step.

1. **Cost of the Cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = \( 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \) dollars.

2. **Tax on the Cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Total tax = \( 10\% \times 240,000 = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \) dollars.

3. **Registration Fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Total registration fees = \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration fees
   - Total cost = \( 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

276,000"
"Given the problem, we start by identifying the number of shells collected by each person on Monday. Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more than Robert, which can be expressed as:

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5 = 25

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. This can be calculated as:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25 = 50

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). Similarly, let \( A_a \) and \( A_b \) represent the number of apples and bananas Andrea has, respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A_a = J_a + 8 \) (Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal)
2. \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \) (Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal)
3. \( J_b = J_a + 4 \) (Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples)
4. \( A_a = 52 \) (Andrea has 52 apples)

First, we substitute the value of \( A_a \) from the fourth equation into the first equation:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
Solving for \( J_a \):
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the value of \( J_a \) to find \( J_b \) from the third equation:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we use the value of \( J_b \) to find \( A_b \) from the second equation:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits by summing up all the fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we start by calculating the total number of cookies she plans to bake. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Adding these together gives:

\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cookies into dozens, since the recipe specifies the amount of flour needed per dozen cookies. There are 12 cookies in a dozen, so we divide the total number of cookies by 12:

\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \]

The recipe requires 2 cups of flour for each dozen cookies. Therefore, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of flour needed per dozen:

\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \]

Thus, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary has, we need to add the number of M&Ms in each of the three bags. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first bag contains 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. Therefore, the number of M&Ms in the second bag is:
   \[
   300 + 12 = 312
   \]
3. The third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. Therefore, the number of M&Ms in the third bag is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in all three bags to find the total:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( S \) represent Sam's current age.
2. Let \( R \) represent Ruby's current age.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( R = 6S \) (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
2. \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

Thus, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of sterling silver beads as \( x \).

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones, so the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the total length of the sterling silver beads is:
\[ \frac{1}{4}x \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the topaz gemstones and the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 8 + \frac{1}{4}x = 25 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 8 + \frac{1}{4}x = 25 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ \frac{1}{4}x = 17 \]
Multiply both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 68 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rows of 5 stars on a 76-star flag, given the distribution of other star rows.

First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows:

- There are three rows of 8 stars each:
  \[
  3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars}
  \]

- There are two rows of 6 stars each:
  \[
  2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars}
  \]

Next, we add the stars from these rows to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[
24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars}
\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find the number of stars in the 5-star rows, we subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars:
\[
76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars}
\]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:

- Together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out: \( A + I = \frac{T}{10} \)

First, substitute \( A = 22 \) into the equation for \( I \):
\[ I = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, substitute \( A \) and \( I \) into the equation for the total number of medals:
\[ 22 + 17 = \frac{T}{10} \]
\[ 39 = \frac{T}{10} \]

To find \( T \), multiply both sides of the equation by 10:
\[ T = 39 \times 10 \]
\[ T = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:
390"

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the steps and apply the conditions given in the problem statement.

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges are left unwashed after Will's sons have washed some of them.

1. First, we identify the ages of the sons:
   - The oldest son is 8 years old.
   - The youngest son is half the age of the oldest, so he is 4 years old.

2. Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
   - The oldest son washes 8 oranges.
   - The youngest son washes 4 oranges.

3. We then find the total number of oranges washed by both sons:
   - Total oranges washed = 8 (oldest) + 4 (youngest) = 12 oranges.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges Will bought:
   - Total oranges bought = 15
   - Oranges left unwashed = 15 - 12 = 3

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed by the household and then determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the total weekly consumption is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. **Determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - We have a 42 kg bag of rice.

   Therefore, the number of weeks the bag will last is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of books sold in the current year.
- \( 2x \) as the number of books sold in the first year (since she sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year).
- \( y \) as the number of books sold in the second year.

We are given:
- The total number of books initially is 250.
- The number of unsold books is 50.
- The number of books sold in the current year is 45.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. The total number of books sold over the three years is 200 (since 250 - 50 = 200).
2. The number of books sold in the current year is 45, so \( x = 45 \).

Using the first equation:
\[ 2x + y + x = 200 \]

Substitute \( x = 45 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(45) + y + 45 = 200 \]
\[ 90 + y + 45 = 200 \]
\[ 135 + y = 200 \]
\[ y = 200 - 135 \]
\[ y = 65 \]

So, the number of books sold in the second year is 65.

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
1300"

"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ratios and proportions. We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. This means Joey's rate of weight loss is:

\[
\text{Joey's rate} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy's rate of weight loss is:

\[
\text{Sandy's rate} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We can set up the proportion:

\[
\text{Sandy's rate} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Substituting Sandy's rate:

\[
0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Solving for the number of weeks:

\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
\]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps using multiplication and addition.

1. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the three people who eat 3 eggs each:**
   - Each of these three people eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for these three people is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the two people who eat 2 eggs each:**
   - Each of these two people eats 2 eggs per day.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for these two people is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

3. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the entire family:**
   - Adding the daily consumption of the two groups, we get \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

4. **Calculate the total weekly egg consumption:**
   - Since the family eats eggs every day, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

"To solve this problem, we will use the information provided to set up and solve a system of linear equations. The key pieces of information are:

1. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
2. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
4. Cera is currently 46 years old.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( N \) be Noah's current age.
- Let \( P \) be the current population of Chile.

First, we determine Noah's age six years ago:
- Cera's current age is 46, so six years ago, Cera was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years old.
- Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) years old.

Next, we determine Noah's current age:
- Noah's current age \( N \) is \( 20 + 6 = 26 \) years old.

Now, we use the information about the population of Chile:
- Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
- Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \( 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \).

We also know that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now:
- Let \( P \) be the current population of Chile.
- Six years ago, the population was \( \frac{P}{2} \).

Setting up the equation:
\[ \frac{P}{2} = 60000 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 60000 \times 2 \]
\[ P = 120000 \]

Therefore, the current population of Chile is \( 120000 \).

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense: \( O = 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense: \( S = \frac{D}{2} \).
- The total number of players on the team is 105: \( D + O + S = 105 \).

Substitute the expressions for \( O \) and \( S \) into the total players equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratios and the number of boys to find the total number of children in the classroom.

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states there are 30 boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 30
   \]

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states there are 3 times as many girls as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states there are \(\frac{1}{10}\) as many nongendered children as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve the problem of how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the rate of change in volume due to the cooling process and the added liquid.

1. **Cooling Rate and Volume Change:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]
   - The total volume increase due to the ice cubes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

2. **Volume Change Due to Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also contributes to the volume increase.

3. **Total Volume Change:**
   - The total volume increase, which represents how much weaker the coffee is, is the sum of the volume changes from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**
   - The monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000.
   - The monthly salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than that of a junior programmer.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:**
   - The number of junior programmers is 40.
   - The monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:**
   - The number of senior programmers is 60.

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in working with positive and negative integers to track the changes in the number of people on the bus at each stop.

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. The total number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off the bus and 8 people got on. The total number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression for the number of people on the bus after the second stop:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables:
- Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
- Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we have the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens using the second equation:
\[ H = 2C \]
\[ H = 2 \times 20 \]
\[ H = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each:
- Total legs from cows: \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \)
- Total legs from chickens: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the weights of the animals as follows:

- \( P \) for the pink frog
- \( B \) for the blue beetle
- \( G \) for the green toad
- \( Y \) for the yellow snake
- \( R \) for the red bird

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( P = B \)
2. \( P = G \)
3. \( P = Y - 10 \)
4. \( P = R + 20 \)

We are also given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, so \( P = 50 \).

Using this information, we can solve for the weights of the other animals:

1. \( B = P = 50 \)
2. \( G = P = 50 \)
3. \( Y = P + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \)
4. \( R = P - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 \)

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The container weighs 20 pounds.

The total weight is given by:
\[ \text{Total weight} = P + B + G + Y + R + \text{Container weight} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables as follows:

- \( M \) is the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- \( S \) is the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.
- \( V \) is the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
- \( O \) is the number of people kicked out for other reasons.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. \( M = 3 \)
2. \( S = 4M - 5 \)
3. \( V = 3S \)
4. The total number of people kicked out is 50, so \( M + S + V + O = 50 \)

First, substitute \( M = 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 7 \) into the equation for \( V \):
\[ V = 3(7) = 21 \]

Now, we have the values for \( M \), \( S \), and \( V \):
\[ M = 3 \]
\[ S = 7 \]

   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[

"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"To determine the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the information that he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means that the remaining \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. We can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of boys and girls in the choir. Given that the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since the performance is with just the female members, we initially have 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts:
- Gifts for family: 6
- Gifts for friends: 4
- Gifts for teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Next, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
Total length of ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total length of ribbon / Total number of gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 inches / 12 gifts
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, which means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

First, we need to determine the value of one part of the ratio. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11. Therefore, each part of the ratio represents:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \text{ popsicles} \]

Next, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cannolis initially.
2. Let \( K \) represent the number of corns initially.

From the problem, we know:
- Allan has 40 cannolis initially: \( C = 40 \).
- There is twice as much corn as cannolis: \( K = 2C \).

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( K \):
\[ K = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis:
\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = C + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis:
\[ \text{New number of corns} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:
\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We know the following:

- Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps.
- He completed half of his steps (5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
- He did an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:

\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with his friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

"To determine the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to calculate the payments for each month and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 168000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sally bought and then determine how much money she has left from her initial $10.

1. **Cost of Taffy:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Cost of Mixed Bag of Seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of Magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for 4 magnets: 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of All Items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
   - Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is:

"To determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog, we need to consider the probabilities of these independent events.

1. **Probability of a candle exploding:**
   - Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means the probability of a candle exploding is \(1 - 0.99 = 0.01\).

2. **Number of candles that are expected to explode:**
   - Given that Marcy makes 50,000 candles, the expected number of exploding candles is:
     \[
     0.01 \times 50000 = 500
     \]

3. **Probability of an exploding candle smelling like wet dog:**
   - It is given that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Therefore, the probability of an exploding candle smelling like wet dog is \(0.05\).

4. **Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog:**
   - The expected number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 500 = 25
     \]

Thus, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables and equations step by step.

1. Let \( J_t \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.
2. Let \( J_s \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
3. Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
4. Let \( S_t \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the tallest trees.
5. Let \( S_s \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.
6. Let \( S_a \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the average trees.

From the problem, we know:
- \( J_t = 30 \)
- \( J_s = \frac{1}{2} J_t = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)
- \( S_t = 2 \times J_t = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- \( S_s = 3 \times J_s = 3 \times 15 = 45 \)
- \( S_a = 0 \)

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ J_t + J_s + J_a + S_t + S_s + S_a = 500 \]

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[ 30 + 15 + J_a + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + J_a = 500 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):

\[ J_a = 500 - 150 \]
\[ J_a = 350 \]

Thus, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, I will use the substitution method.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D = 180 - C \) into the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), substitute this value back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To solve the problem, we will use the relationships between the sizes of the lockers and apply our knowledge of ratios and proportions.

1. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker}
   \]
   Therefore, to find Zack's locker size:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker}
   \]
   Therefore, to find Timothy's locker size:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine the distance Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the point where the comb landed and Oliver's current position.

1. Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet, so the comb's final elevation: 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet
3. Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet

The difference in elevation that Oliver needs to climb is:
6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to perform a series of additions and multiplications. 

First, we note the initial capital Mr. Josue had:
- Initial capital: $5000

Next, we account for the amounts received from the two banks:
- The first bank provided $4000.
- The second bank provided twice the amount of the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\).

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total capital:
- Initial capital: $5000
- From the first bank: $4000
- From the second bank: $8000

Total capital = $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $17000

Thus, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, and then find the difference between these original prices.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as \( C \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. Each card is sold for $1.5. The total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is given by:

\[ \text{Total money from selling cards} = \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 \]

We know that Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so the total amount of money he makes is:

\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Setting up the equation:

\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2 \times 1.5}{3}C = 150 \]
\[ \frac{3}{3}C = 150 \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using our expertise in ratios and quantities.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order after applying the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Dora currently has:

- Money saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of candy bars George bought.
- George bought 3 bags of chips.

The cost of each bag of chips is 40 cents, and the cost of each candy bar is 75 cents. George spent a total of $5, and he had 1% of his money left. 

First, we calculate the amount of money George had left:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ dollars} = 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money George spent is:
\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we start by determining how many lollipops Ray shared. Ray initially had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops shared is:

25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

Next, we need to divide these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we perform the division:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

Thus, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we start by calculating the weight of each piece. Given that the cake weighs 20 ounces and is divided into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the total weight of the pieces they have consumed is:

\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces/piece} \times 2 \text{ pieces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Subtracting the weight of the consumed pieces from the total weight of the cake gives us the weight of the remaining cake:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the given length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width. The area of the room is given as 360 square feet, and the area formula is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter formula for a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is:

"To determine the car's average speed during the trip, we can use the concept of weighted averages. The average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, which can be seen as a weighted average of the speeds, with the weights being the time spent at each speed.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed using the weighted average formula:**
   - The average speed is given by:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}

"To solve the problem, we need to translate the given conditions into a linear equation. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We are given that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that this combined length represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are two remoras, the combined length is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

- \( B \) for the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids not allergic to anything, which is the complement of the union of sets \( A \) and \( B \) in the universal set \( U \).

First, we calculate the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids in \( A \cup B \) from the total number of kids in the class:
\[
|U| - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20

"Given the problem, we start by calculating the number of songs Luri has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we determine how many more songs each can add to their players, given that the media player can hold up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

5. **Converting the Cost to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To calculate the height of the human pyramid, we need to sum the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer and then convert the total height from inches to feet.

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we add the heights of all the layers to find the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:

"To solve this problem, we can use multiplication to find the total number of minutes Charisma has walked over 5 days.

First, we calculate the number of walking breaks Charisma takes each day. Since she works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute walk every hour, she takes:
\[ 8 \text{ breaks/day} \]

Next, we determine the total walking time per day by multiplying the number of breaks by the duration of each break:
\[ 8 \text{ breaks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/break} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Finally, to find the total walking time over 5 days, we multiply the daily walking time by the number of days:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given.

Let \( A \) represent Angela's current age.

We know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Brett is currently 14 years old, so in four years, Angela's age will be:
\[ A + 4 = 3 \times 14 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of oranges and then determine how many Greek orange pies can be made, given that each pie requires three oranges.

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To determine how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Thus, the number of Greek orange pies they can make is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up and solve a linear equation. Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve this equation, we first isolate \( x \) on one side. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"To solve the system of linear equations with three variables, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

We are given the following equations based on the problem statement:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) into the first equation:
\[ L + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ L + 3D = 43 \]

Now, substitute \( L = D + 7 \) into the equation \( L + 3D = 43 \):
\[ (D + 7) + 3D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we have \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, the number of insects Lily found is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we start by adding the fractions of the skein they each used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

First, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Next, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Given the problem, we can set up a series of linear equations to find the length of the couch. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( C \) be the width of the chair.
- Let \( R \) be the width of the rug.
- Let \( L \) be the length of the couch.

From the problem, we know:
1. The chair is 3 feet wide, so \( C = 3 \).
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so \( R = C + 5 \).
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so \( L = 2R + 2 \).

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, substitute the value of \( R \) into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = 2(8) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

We know the following:
- Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- She bought 1 pack of grape gum for $2.
- She bought 1 pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.
- The total cost of all the gum was $7.

We can set up the equation for the total cost:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 2S = 4 \]

"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we can use a linear programming approach to allocate his budget optimally. Let's define the variables and constraints:

- Let \( x \) be the number of 2 x 4 pieces of wood.
- Let \( y \) be the number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

**Objective Function:**
Maximize the total number of popsicle sticks:
\[ \text{Total Sticks} = 200x + 400y \]

**Constraints:**
1. Budget constraint:
\[ 4x + 6y \leq 24 \]
2. Non-negativity constraints:
\[ x \geq 0 \]
\[ y \geq 0 \]

To solve this, we can evaluate the feasible region defined by the constraints and find the vertices. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraints intersect.

1. **Intersection of \( 4x + 6y = 24 \) with the axes:**
   - When \( x = 0 \):
     \[ 6y = 24 \implies y = 4 \]
   - When \( y = 0 \):
     \[ 4x = 24 \implies x = 6 \]

2. **Vertices of the feasible region:**
   - \( (0, 0) \)
   - \( (6, 0) \)
   - \( (0, 4) \)

We will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:

- At \( (0, 0) \):
  \[ \text{Total Sticks} = 200(0) + 400(0) = 0 \]

- At \( (6, 0) \):
  \[ \text{Total Sticks} = 200(6) + 400(0) = 1200 \]

- At \( (0, 4) \):
  \[ \text{Total Sticks} = 200(0) + 400(4) = 1600 \]

The maximum number of popsicle sticks is achieved at the vertex \( (0, 4) \), which corresponds to buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of onions Sophia bought.
- \( y \) as the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Now, we solve these equations for \( x \) and \( y \):

1. For onions:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

2. For potatoes:
\[ 4y = 4 \]
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} \]
\[ y = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To achieve his New Year's resolution of losing 30 pounds by his birthday on July 19th, Andy needs to establish a consistent daily calorie deficit. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Determine the total number of days:**
   - From December 31st to July 19th:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days

   Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit required:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
   - Each pound of weight loss requires a deficit of 3500 calories.
   - Total calories to lose 30 pounds = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let \( L \) represent the cost of the lot, and \( H \) represent the cost of the house.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

This can be translated into the following system of equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:

"To determine the number of loaves of bread left at the Beverly Hills Bakery, we need to perform a series of addition and subtraction operations. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initial Total Loaves Baked:** 200
2. **Loaves Sold in the Morning:** 93
3. **Loaves Sold in the Afternoon:** 39
4. **Loaves Returned by the Grocery Store:** 6

First, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the initial total:
\[ 200 - 93 = 107 \]

Next, we subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon from the remaining total:
\[ 107 - 39 = 68 \]

Finally, we add the loaves returned by the grocery store:
\[ 68 + 6 = 74 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread they had left is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which one person can paint a house and then scale it up to the rate for 5 people.

1. **Determine the rate for one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in \(5 \times 2 = 10\) days.

2. **Convert the time to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, one person can paint a whole house in \(10 \times 24 = 240\) hours.

3. **Determine the rate for 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint a house in 240 hours, then 5 people working together can paint the house in \(\frac{240}{5} = 48\) hours.

Thus, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
   \[
   S_O = C_O - 2
   \]
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3C_O
   \]
3. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
   \[
   S_J = C_J - 2
   \]
4. Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

First, we substitute \( S_O = 20 \) into the first equation to find \( C_O \):
\[
20 = C_O - 2
\]
\[
C_O = 22
\]

Next, we use the value of \( C_O \) to find \( C_J \):
\[
C_J = 3C_O
\]
\[
C_J = 3 \times 22
\]
\[
C_J = 66
\]

Now, we use \( C_J \) to find \( S_J \):
\[
S_J = C_J - 2
\]
\[
S_J = 66 - 2
\]
\[
S_J = 64
\]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[
\text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84
\]
\[
\text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88
\]
\[
\text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation to represent the total cost of the items Tom bought. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

Given:
- The cost of one CD is $4.
- The total amount Tom paid is $48.
- The total cost can be represented by the equation: \( 4 + H = 48 \).

First, we solve for \( H \) (the cost of the headphone set):
\[
H = 48 - 4
\]
\[
H = 44
\]

Now, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. The cost of one CD is $4, so the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
\[
\text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4}
\]
\[
\text{Number of additional CDs} = 11
\]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8-week period, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Regular Weekly Workouts:**
   - Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for most of the weeks.
   - Number of weeks with 4 hours: \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks (since 3 weeks have different durations).

2. **Special Weeks:**
   - Two consecutive weeks with 5 hours each.
   - One week with 6 hours.

3. **Calculate Total Hours:**
   - For the 5 weeks with 4 hours each:
     \[
     5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - For the 2 weeks with 5 hours each:
     \[
     2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - For the 1 week with 6 hours:
     \[
     1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Sum the Total Hours:**
   \[

"To solve this multi-step arithmetic word problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - The bus starts with 48 passengers.

2. **First Stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - Remaining passengers: \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - New total: \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)

3. **Second Stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - Remaining passengers: \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on: \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   - New total: \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let \( J \) represent Jame's current age, and \( C \) represent his cousin's current age.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     J + 5 = 27
     \]
   - Solving for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 27 - 5 = 22
     \]

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( J + 8 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5
     \]
   - Substitute \( J = 22 \) into the equation:
     \[
     C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
     \]
   - Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     C + 8 = 2(30) - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 55 - 8 = 47
     \]

3. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is:
     \[
     C - J = 47 - 22 = 25
     \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( C \) be the cost of the computer.
- \( P \) be the cost of the printer.
- \( M \) be the cost of one monitor.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.
3. The computer cost $1,100.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( C + 2M + P = 2400 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. \( C = 1100 \)

First, substitute the value of \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 \]
\[ P = 700 \]

Now, substitute the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \)."

"In a tiered commission structure, the commission rate varies based on the sales thresholds. For the given scenario, the commission is calculated as follows:

1. The first $1000 in sales earns a 30% commission.
2. Any sales amount above $1000 earns an additional 10% commission.

Given that Antonella sold goods worth $2500, we can break down her earnings as follows:

1. Commission on the first $1000:
   \[
   1000 \times 0.30 = 300
   \]

2. Commission on the remaining $1500 (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500):
   \[
   1500 \times 0.10 = 150
   \]

3. Total commission earned by Antonella:
   \[
   300 + 150 = 450
   \]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the quantities of coffee consumed by Octavia and Juan, and then apply basic multiplication and division to find the required reduction in Juan's coffee intake.

First, we know that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Octavia drinks half of this recommended amount, which means she drinks:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommended amount of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a linear equation based on the information given.

Let \( N \) represent the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

We know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old. At that time, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the payments into distinct parts and then sum them up.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, the total for these three teeth is:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount per tooth as she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00 per tooth, half of this amount is:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50
   \]
   Therefore, the total for these two teeth is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( R \) for the number of goals Richie scored,
- \( M \) for the number of goals Mark scored,
- \( A \) for the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: \( R = M + 20 \)
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: \( R = A + 45 \)
3. Richie scored 80 goals: \( R = 80 \)

We can substitute \( R = 80 \) into the first two equations to find \( M \) and \( A \).

First, substitute \( R = 80 \) into \( R = M + 20 \):
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
\[ M = 80 - 20 \]
\[ M = 60 \]

Next, substitute \( R = 80 \) into \( R = A + 45 \):
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]
\[ A = 80 - 45 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now, we have the number of goals each teenager scored:
- Richie: \( R = 80 \)
- Mark: \( M = 60 \)
- Anna: \( A = 35 \)

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we sum their individual scores:
\[ R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:
\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the durations into minutes and then sum them up.

First, let's convert the duration of each movie into minutes:

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long:
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 30 minutes
   - Total for the first movie: 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long:
   - 2 hours = 120 minutes
   - 5 minutes
   - Total for the second movie: 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Next, we add the total minutes of both movies:
- 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To determine the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses, we start by calculating the value of Juan's house, which is 30% less than Herb's house.

First, we calculate 30% of Herb's house value:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Next, we subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The combined value of the two houses is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of cups Judy bought.
- \( d \) as the number of dishes Judy bought.

From the problem, we know:
1. Judy bought a dozen cups, so \( c = 12 \).
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so \( d = 2c \).

Substituting \( c = 12 \) into the second equation:
\[ d = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy's friend:
- Her friend brought 40 cups.
- Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so the number of dishes her friend brought is \( d + 20 \).

Substituting \( d = 24 \) into the equation for her friend's dishes:
\[ \text{Number of dishes brought by her friend} = 24 + 20 = 44 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:
- Total number of cups brought by both:
  \[ 12 + 40 = 52 \]
- Total number of dishes brought by both:
  \[ 24 + 44 = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend is:
\[ 52 + 68 = 120 \]

"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price per box.
2. Determine the total cost for 2 boxes.
3. Calculate the total number of pairs of contacts from 2 boxes.
4. Compute the cost per pair of contacts.

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price per box.**
The original price per box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price per box is:
\[ 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost for 2 boxes.**
The cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pairs of contacts from 2 boxes.**
Each box contains 90 single-use contacts, and since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes is:
\[ \frac{2 \times 90}{2} = 90 \]

**Step 4: Compute the cost per pair of contacts.**
The cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Thus, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 2.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in multiplication and addition to calculate the total earnings for both John and Jill, and then determine the difference in their earnings.

**Step 1: Calculate the total hours worked by Jill.**
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

**Step 2: Calculate the total hours worked by John.**
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

**Step 3: Calculate the earnings for Jill.**
- Jill earns $10 per hour.
- Total earnings for Jill = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

**Step 4: Calculate the earnings for John.**
- John earns $10 per hour.
- Total earnings for John = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

**Step 5: Determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill.**
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

Thus, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given percentages and the total number of jelly beans.

Let \( B \) represent the number of blue jelly beans. According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue jelly beans).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue jelly beans).

The total number of jelly beans is 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

"To solve the problem of determining how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The height of the beanstalk can be modeled by the equation:

\[ h(t) = h_0 \cdot 2^t \]

where:
- \( h(t) \) is the height of the beanstalk at time \( t \) (in days),
- \( h_0 \) is the initial height of the beanstalk,
- \( t \) is the number of days.

Given:
- The initial height \( h_0 = 4 \) feet,
- The height of the window is 20 feet.

We need to find the smallest integer \( t \) such that \( h(t) > 20 \).

Substitute the given values into the equation:

\[ 4 \cdot 2^t > 20 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ 2^t > 5 \]

To solve for \( t \), we can take the logarithm of both sides. Using the natural logarithm (ln):

\[ \ln(2^t) > \ln(5) \]

Using the property of logarithms \( \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) \):

\[ t \ln(2) > \ln(5) \]

Solve for \( t \):

\[ t > \frac{\ln(5)}{\ln(2)} \]

Using a calculator to find the values of the logarithms:

\[ \ln(5) \approx 1.6094 \]
\[ \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \]

So:

\[ t > \frac{1.6094}{0.6931} \approx 2.32 \]

Since \( t \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:

\[ t = 3 \]

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine the total grams of protein John consumes per week from mushrooms, we can use ratios and multiplication, which are fundamental in solving such problems.

First, we establish the ratio of protein to the weight of mushrooms:
- 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms each day. To find the protein content in 200 grams, we use the ratio:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left( \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} \right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \]
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake per week. Since there are 7 days in a week:
\[ \text{Total protein per week} = 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \]
\[ \text{Total protein per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Thus, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day.

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Next, we solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( J \) from both sides to isolate the variable:

\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information about the angles in the triangle.

Let \( x \) be the measure of the smallest angle in degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we have the measure of the smallest angle, we can find the measures of the other two angles:
- The second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- The largest angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

   - Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
   - Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
   - Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

2. **Sum the total value of all the coins:**
   - Total value = 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

3. **Determine how many gumballs he can buy:**
   - Each gumball costs 5 cents.
   - Number of gumballs = 345 cents ÷ 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To solve this problem, we can use the relationship between distance, rate (speed), and time, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can first determine the rate (speed) of the plane:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate. Using the same formula, we rearrange it to solve for time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the values for the additional distance and the rate:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the individual production rates of Ruiz and Marissa, and then calculate their combined output over a 12-hour workday.

1. **Ruiz's Production Rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

2. **Marissa's Production Rate:**
   - Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, Marissa's production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

3. **Combined Production Over 12 Hours:**
   - Ruiz's production over 12 hours:
     \[
     60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Marissa's production over 12 hours:
     \[
     90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Total production by both Ruiz and Marissa:
     \[
     720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds}

"To determine Patrick's total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the earnings for each time period and then sum them up.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- The earnings per hour for the first four hours are calculated as:
  \[
  15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour}
  \]
- For four hours, the total earnings are:
  \[
  7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- The earnings per hour for the next two hours are calculated as:
  \[
  10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour}
  \]
- For two hours, the total earnings are:
  \[
  6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
\[
30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

   \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can handle by the number of rotations per year:
   \[
   \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost.

Given:
- The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
- The directions recommend using 2 pumps per wash, which provides 120 washes.

First, we calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:
\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.**

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

**Step 2: Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.**

A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money.**

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need, we can use our expertise in fractions and multiplication. 

First, we know that 1/4 pound of butter is required to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 4 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound} \]

Next, since Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants each day for a week (7 days), the total amount of butter required for the week is:
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the increased funding required for the extended period. The initial 5 months are funded at a flat rate, while the subsequent months see a 50% increase in funding per month.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Monthly funding for the first 5 months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: $20,000 * 5 = $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for initial 5 months + Cost for additional 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to sum the amounts of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat. 

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to meet the height requirement for the roller coaster. The height requirement is 4 feet, and Adam is currently 40 inches tall, growing at a rate of 2 inches per year.

First, convert the height requirement from feet to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, calculate the additional height Adam needs to grow to meet the requirement:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can set up a proportion to find the number of years (\( y \)) it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ year}} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{y \text{ years}} \]

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the concept of relative speed and the relationship between distance, speed, and time.

Given:
- Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
- Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
- Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.

First, we calculate the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds:
\[
\text{Relative speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
\]

Next, we use the formula for time, which is the distance divided by the speed:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to analyze the relationship between the total cost and the number of classes attended.

Given:
- Total cost of classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10
- Maximum allowable cost per class: $10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he attends \( 10 - x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Thus, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week, given their daily processing rates and the fact that they work all days of the week.

First, let's establish the daily processing rates:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly processing rates for each:
- Jewel processes \(50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week}\).
- Julie processes \(100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week}\).

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. **Paisley's Distance:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.
   - Let \( P = 4 \).

2. **Reggie's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran.
   - Therefore, \( R = 5P \).
   - Substituting \( P = 4 \), we get \( R = 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

3. **Lynn's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.
   - Let \( L \) be the distance Lynn ran.
   - According to the problem, \( R = L + 3 \).
   - Substituting \( R = 20 \), we get \( 20 = L + 3 \).

4. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( 20 = L + 3 \)
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: \( L = 20 - 3 \)
   - \( L = 17 \)

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To determine the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given prices.

Let \( a \) be the cost of one apple and \( o \) be the cost of one orange.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( 4a = 5.20 \)
2. \( 3o = 3.30 \)

First, solve for \( a \) and \( o \):

1. \( a = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \)
2. \( o = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \)

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ \text{Total sleep time for math teachers} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of money Aurelia has as \( A \), Kassidy has as \( K \), and Rayna has as \( R \).

Given:
1. Aurelia has $120.
2. Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia.
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( A = 120 \)
2. \( K = \frac{3}{4}A \)
3. \( R = K + 60 \)

First, substitute \( A = 120 \) into the second equation to find \( K \):
\[ K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, substitute \( K = 90 \) into the third equation to find \( R \):
\[ R = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we have the amounts for each person:
- Aurelia: \( A = 120 \)
- Kassidy: \( K = 90 \)
- Rayna: \( R = 150 \)

To find out how much each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally, we first calculate the total amount of money:
\[ \text{Total} = A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

Since there are 3 people, the amount each person would have if they share equally is:
\[ \text{Amount per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

Thus, each person would have 120 dollars if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them.

"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we will use multiplication and addition. Each muffin requires 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 tablespoons of salt. 

First, we calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed for 16 muffins:

- Flour: \( 5 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 80 \text{ tablespoons} \)
- Sugar: \( 3 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 48 \text{ tablespoons} \)
- Salt: \( 0.25 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 4 \text{ tablespoons} \)

Next, we add these amounts together to find the total amount of dry ingredients:

\[ 80 \text{ tablespoons} + 48 \text{ tablespoons} + 4 \text{ tablespoons} = 132 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana needs to make 16 muffins is:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sally has. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, and Janey has 21 books. This can be expressed as:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first isolate the term involving \( S \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine the number of days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the current height from feet to inches:**
   - The current height of the bamboo is 20 feet.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the current height in inches is:
     \[
     20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Determine the total growth needed:**
   - The desired height is 600 inches.
   - The current height is 240 inches.
   - The growth needed is:
     \[
     600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:**
   - The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day.
   - The number of days required is:
     \[
     \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
     \]

Therefore, the bamboo will reach 600 inches in 12 days.

"James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. When 8 more dogs join the shelter, he needs to buy 8 more toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs. After buying these toys, he finds that the number of dogs has doubled to 24. To have one toy for each of the 24 dogs, he needs to buy 12 more toys. When he returns, 3 dogs have left the shelter, so he now needs toys for 21 dogs. Since he already has 20 toys (4 initial + 8 first purchase + 8 second purchase), he needs to buy 1 more toy to have enough for 21 dogs.

Total toys needed: 4 (initial) + 8 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) + 1 (final purchase) = 25

"To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of multiplication to determine Karen's earnings over two days. 

First, we establish the hourly wage for Karen. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate Karen's daily earnings. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Finally, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

Next, solve for \( x \):

\[ 6x = 36 \times 96 \]

\[ 6x = 3456 \]

\[ x = \frac{3456}{6} \]

\[ x = 576 \]

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( K \) for the number of cookies Katarina has.
- \( M \) for the number of cookies Max has.
- \( C \) for the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- \( S \) for the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
4. Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   K = 68
   \]

First, substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation:
\[
68 = M - 5
\]
Solving for \( M \):
\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73
\]

Next, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the second equation:
\[
73 = C + 12
\]
Solving for \( C \):
\[
C = 73 - 12 = 61
\]

Finally, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the third equation:
\[
S = 73 + 23 = 96
\]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: \( K = 68 \)
- Max: \( M = 73 \)
- Cookie Monster: \( C = 61 \)
- Summer: \( S = 96 \)

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To solve the problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To determine the total time Chris took to mow his lawn by using both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we can calculate the weighted average of the time intervals for each mode.

1. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - 60 minutes

2. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - 40 minutes

3. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes

4. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes

5. **Total time to mow the lawn:**
   - Add the time for ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let \( T \) represent the age of one of the twins, and \( R \) represent the age of one of the triplets.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Next, we simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we have \( R = 6 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( T \):
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is \( \boxed{13} \)."
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework. John has:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( L \) represent the cost of one lollipop and \( C \) represent the cost of one candy.

From the problem, we know:
1. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
2. Each lollipop costs $0.40.

We can write the first equation based on the total cost:
\[ 5L + 4C = 3.20 \]

Given that each lollipop costs $0.40, we have:
\[ L = 0.40 \]

Substituting \( L = 0.40 \) into the first equation:
\[ 5(0.40) + 4C = 3.20 \]
\[ 2.00 + 4C = 3.20 \]

Next, solve for \( C \):
\[ 4C = 3.20 - 2.00 \]
\[ 4C = 1.20 \]
\[ C = \frac{1.20}{4} \]
\[ C = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. Using the values of \( L \) and \( C \):
\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10L = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10C = 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then extend these to the total period.

First, let's calculate the monthly savings for each individual:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
  \[
  20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total savings over ten years (120 months):
- Rong's total savings:
  \[
  20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
  \]
- Neil's total savings:
  \[
  28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the services and then determine how much money John leaves with after paying the bill.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - Each vaccine costs $20.
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost of vaccines: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let \( T \) be the total bill.
   - The heartworm check cost is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.40:
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.50, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.00, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
- Total cost for bananas: $5.00
- Total cost for apples: $6.00
- Total cost for oranges: $21.00

The total price for the crate is \(5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

   \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5h = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

   Therefore, the total number of chairs currently available is:
   \[
   8 \text{ (high chairs)} + 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Total chairs needed = 57
   - Total chairs currently available = 48

   The number of additional chairs needed is:
   \[
   57 - 48 = 9
   \]

Thus, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the points collected by each student and then determine how many points the class is missing to reach the threshold of 400 points.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find 30% of Adam's points:
   \[
   0.30 \times 50 = 15
   \]
   Therefore, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, Marta's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:
\[
400 - 255 = 145
\]

Thus, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the capacities of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks as \( G_i \), \( G_o \), and \( G_a \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel:
   \[
   G_i = 4000
   \]
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck:
   \[
   G_o = G_i + 800
   \]
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds:
   \[
   G_i + G_o + G_a = 11600
   \]

First, substitute \( G_i \) into the equation for \( G_o \):
\[
G_o = 4000 + 800 = 4800
\]

Next, substitute \( G_i \) and \( G_o \) into the combined capacity equation:
\[
4000 + 4800 + G_a = 11600
\]

Simplify and solve for \( G_a \):
\[
8800 + G_a = 11600
\]
\[
G_a = 11600 - 8800
\]
\[
G_a = 2800
\]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. We know that the cat's speed is 5 times the turtle's speed. Given the cat's speed is 15 feet per second, we can set up the following proportion to find the turtle's speed:

\[ \text{Cat's speed} : \text{Turtle's speed} = 5 : 1 \]

Given:
\[ \text{Cat's speed} = 15 \text{ feet/second} \]

Let \( x \) be the turtle's speed in feet per second. The proportion can be written as:
\[ 15 : x = 5 : 1 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{15}{x} = \frac{5}{1} \]
\[ 15 = 5x \]
\[ x = \frac{15}{5} \]
\[ x = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the fundraising goal of $6300, given that the amount raised per hour is consistent.

1. **Calculate the amount raised per hour:**
   - In the first 3 hours, they raised $2100.
   - Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:
     \[
     \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:**
   - The total goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - The remaining amount needed is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional hours needed to raise the remaining amount:**
   - Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required is:
     \[
     \text{Additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of hours needed:**

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can break down the problem into a series of steps:

1. **Calculate the total water usage by the city:**
   The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Determine the industrial water usage:**
   80% of the city's water usage is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the industrial water usage is:
   \[
   40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%
   \]
   This means 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes.

3. **Calculate the non-industrial water usage:**
   To find the non-industrial water usage, subtract the industrial water usage from the total water usage by the city:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8\% \]

  \[
  \text{Total chocolate ice cream} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]
- For vanilla ice cream:
  \[
  \text{Total vanilla ice cream} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
\[
\text{Total ice cream} = 2400 \text{ quarts (chocolate)} + 600 \text{ quarts (vanilla)} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:

"To determine the savings James made by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost for each option and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost of Picking Blueberries
- **Fixed cost to go picking:** $20
- **Cost per pound of blueberries picked:** $1.5
- **Pounds of blueberries picked:** 30

The total cost of picking blueberries is calculated as:
\[ \text{Total cost of picking} = \text{Fixed cost} + (\text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Pounds picked}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) \]
\[ \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + 45 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of picking} = 65 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost of Buying Blueberries at the Store
- **Cost per pound of blueberries at the store:** $2.5
- **Pounds of blueberries:** 30

The total cost of buying blueberries at the store is calculated as:
\[ \text{Total cost of buying} = \text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of buying} = 2.5 \times 30 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of buying} = 75 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Savings
The savings is the difference between the total cost of buying and the total cost of picking:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost of buying} - \text{Total cost of picking} \]
\[ \text{Savings} = 75 - 65 \]
\[ \text{Savings} = 10 \]

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries compared to buying them at the store.

"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant after some have been sent for repair, we can apply the principles of subtraction. 

First, we calculate the total number of chairs initially available:
- Normal chairs: 170
- Baby chairs: 23
- Total chairs: 170 + 23 = 193

Next, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair:
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Total chairs sent for repair: 20 + 13 = 33

Finally, we subtract the total number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total:
- Total chairs left: 193 - 33 = 160

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices consumed and then subtract this from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \) slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \) slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"To determine the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages, we first need to calculate the time each takes individually.

1. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.
2. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the dog's time is:
   \[
   \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Next, we calculate the average time by summing the times and dividing by 2:

3. The average time is:
   \[
   \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To solve the problem, we need to translate the given information into a linear equation and then solve for the unknown variable, which represents the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

Given:
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches.
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

First, convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 8 \text{ feet and 4 inches} = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes can be expressed as:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:
1. Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

2. Divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the fraction of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Fraction of students' windows smashed = \( \frac{1}{4} \)
- Number of students' windows smashed = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Fraction of teachers' windows smashed = \( \frac{3}{4} \)
- Number of teachers' windows smashed = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \) windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = \( 64 + 48 = 112 \) windows.

2. **Number of blue spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. **Percentage of blue spools:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

   Converting to a percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of blue spools is 40%.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) represent Dora's age, \( F \) represent Dora's father's age, and \( M \) represent Dora's mother's age.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
2. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
3. Dora is 15 years old.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( F = 2D + 8 \)
2. \( M = F - 4 \)
3. \( D = 15 \)

First, substitute \( D = 15 \) into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[ F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, substitute \( F = 38 \) into the second equation to find \( M \):
\[ M = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
- Dora: \( D = 15 \)
- Father: \( F = 38 \)
- Mother: \( M = 34 \)

To find the total combined age, we sum these ages:
\[ D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

"To calculate the total weight of Cindy's books, we will use addition and multiplication, focusing on the weights provided for each book.

- Math and science books: Each weighs 2 pounds. Since there are two books, we multiply 2 pounds by 2:
  \[
  2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- French book: Weighs 4 pounds:
  \[
  4 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- English book: Weighs 3 pounds:
  \[
  3 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- History book: Weighs twice as much as the English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, we multiply 3 pounds by 2:
  \[
  3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we add the weights of all the books together:
\[
4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (History)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, and \( A \) represent the number of votes against it.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against: \( F = 2A \).
2. The total number of votes is 33: \( F + A = 33 \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( A \):

\[ F + A = 33 \]
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now that we have \( A = 11 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( F \):

\[ F = 2A \]
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given ratios and the total number of cases of shingles required.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
- \( 2x \) as the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house (since the first house needs half of the second house).
- \( 2x \) as the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house (since the third house needs double the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to determine the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the total cost of the four pizzas, which is 64 dollars. We know that two of the pizzas together cost 30 dollars. To find the total cost of the remaining two pizzas, we subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost:

64 - 30 = 34 dollars

This means the remaining two pizzas together cost 34 dollars. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the remaining pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each:

34 / 2 = 17 dollars

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can use multiplication and addition to break down the problem into manageable parts.

1. **Calculate the rides on the usual days:**
   - They ride 3 times a day for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Calculate the rides on the special days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Calculate the total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
3. After adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve this system of equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To determine the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the exponential growth of the student population over the first five months of the year. The population doubles at the end of each month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year.

The formula for exponential growth in this context is:
\[ P(t) = P_0 \times 2^t \]
where:
- \( P(t) \) is the population at time \( t \),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial population,
- \( t \) is the number of months.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 10 \) (initial number of students),
- \( t = 5 \) (end of May, which is 5 months from the beginning of the year).

Let's calculate the population at the end of May:
\[ P(5) = 10 \times 2^5 \]
\[ P(5) = 10 \times 32 \]
\[ P(5) = 320 \]

The number of students at the end of May is 320. To find the number of additional students who joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the final number:
\[ \text{Additional students} = P(5) - P_0 \]
\[ \text{Additional students} = 320 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Additional students} = 310 \]

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average number of branches Felix climbs per day based on his weekly earnings and the cost per branch. 

First, we determine the total number of branches climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbs per day is:

   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **Petals Dropped:**
   - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
   - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
   - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
   - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

4. **Total Petals Dropped:**
   \[
   5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
   \]

5. **Remaining Petals in the Vase:**
   \[
   101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
   \]

Thus, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

\[

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic principles of subtraction and division. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Marshmallows**: The bag contains 35 marshmallows.
2. **Marshmallows Used**: John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows. DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows used is:
   \[
   9 + 9 = 18
   \]
3. **Marshmallows Dropped**: They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.
4. **Total Marshmallows Used and Lost**: Adding the marshmallows used and dropped:
   \[
   18 + 3 = 21
   \]
5. **Remaining Marshmallows**: Subtract the total number of marshmallows used and lost from the initial total:
   \[
   35 - 21 = 14
   \]
6. **Marshmallows Per Kid**: Since there are 2 kids (John and DeSean), we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]

Each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine the total amount of money used by Jack and his three friends, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses and then convert that into dollars.

1. **Determine the play time per quarter for each person:**
   - Jack: 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend: \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):**
   - Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Two friends: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \).
   - One friend: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters.
   - Two friends: \( 24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).
   - One friend: 8 quarters.
   - Total quarters: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Convert the total number of quarters into dollars:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables as follows:

- \( z \) for the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- \( f \) for the amount of fragrance in ounces.
- \( s \) for the amount of salt in ounces.
- \( g \) for the amount of sugar in ounces.
- \( o \) for the amount of oil in ounces.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance: \( z = f \).
2. The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar: \( s = g \).
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).
4. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).

We also know that the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total volume equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 2s \]
Since \( s = 2z \) and \( z = 1 \):
\[ s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]
\[ o = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( 4 \) ounces.

"To determine the total amount John spent at the market, we can break down the calculation into two parts: the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \( 3 \times 500 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \( 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Total amount spent: \( 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in linear equations and percentage calculations.

Given:
- Robert has 20 cars.
- Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
- Joe sells 20% of his cars.
- Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother.

Step 1: Determine the number of cars Joe initially has.
\[ \text{Number of cars Joe has} = 2 \times \text{Number of cars Robert has} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars Joe sells.
\[ \text{Number of cars Joe sells} = 20\% \times 40 = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away.
\[ \text{Number of cars Joe gives away} = 2 \times \text{Number of cars Joe sells} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Step 4: Determine the number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars.
\[ \text{Number of cars Joe has left} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in multiplication and addition to calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days, converting the final result into minutes.

First, we determine the time Sandy walked on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time from both days to find the total time in hours:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the fact that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \]"

"To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we can use multiplication and subtraction. 

First, we calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Total tins of cat food = 8 * 11 = 88 tins.

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Total tins of dog food = 6 * 6 = 36 tins.

Now, we find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of Magic Cards that PJ has as \( P \), the number of cards that Smendrick has as \( S \), and the number of cards that Becca has as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of cards is 341.
2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
3. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( P + S + B = 341 \)
2. \( B = S + 12 \)
3. \( S = 3P \)

First, we substitute the third equation into the second equation to express \( B \) in terms of \( P \):
\[ B = 3P + 12 \]

Next, we substitute both \( S \) and \( B \) in terms of \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we have \( P \), we can find \( S \) and \( B \):
\[ S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]
\[ B = 3P + 12 = 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

1. **Green Eggs:**
   Cindy had 5 green eggs.

2. **Blue Eggs:**
   She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs:**
   She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]

4. **Yellow Eggs:**
   She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs to find the total number:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = 5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use multiplication and addition, which are fundamental operations in arithmetic.

First, we calculate the distance Mason travels in the initial 4 hours:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance Mason travels in the subsequent 6 hours:
\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
\]

To find the total distance traveled, we add the two distances together:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}

"To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between distance, rate (speed), and time, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let \( D \) be the distance across the highway.
   - Let \( S \) be the speed of one kangaroo.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory:
   \[
   J = 2R
   \]

First, substitute \( K = 20 \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[
R = 20 + 20 = 40
\]

Next, substitute \( R = 40 \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[
J = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

Now, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[
J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
\]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[
140

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to consider the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in, the contributions from her part-time job and her mom, and the additional amount she still needs.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400
   \]
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[
x + 150 + 80
\]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[
x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50
\]

Simplifying the right side:
\[
x + 230 = 350
\]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides:
\[
x = 350 - 230
\]
\[
x = 120
\]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in multiplication and subtraction. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam slices 3 large apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam slices 5 small apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
- Total slices = \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:
- Slices left = \(30 - 15 = 15\) slices.

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can use division and subtraction to solve the problem step-by-step.

1. **Current Milk Production:**
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - The farmer has 3 cows.
   - Total milk production from 3 cows: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.

2. **Target Milk Production:**
   - The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

3. **Additional Milk Needed:**
   - Additional milk required: \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters a day.

4. **Number of Additional Cows Needed:**
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - Number of additional cows needed: \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths. Each glue stick originally measures 12 millimeters.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Next, we sum the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( S_J \) be the number of socks Jack has.
- \( D_J \) be the number of dishes Jack has.
- \( S_P \) be the number of socks Peter has.
- \( D_P \) be the number of dishes Peter has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Jack collected 60 dishes:
   \[
   D_J = 60
   \]
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks:
   \[
   D_J = 2S_J
   \]
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:
   \[
   S_P = 2S_J
   \]
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:
   \[
   D_P = \frac{D_J}{2}
   \]

First, we can use the second piece of information to find the number of socks Jack has:
\[
D_J = 2S_J \implies 60 = 2S_J \implies S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]

Now, we can find the number of socks Peter has:
\[
S_P = 2S_J = 2 \times 30 = 60
\]

Next, we can find the number of dishes Peter has:
\[
D_P = \frac{D_J}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
\[
\text{Total socks} = S_J + S_P = 30 + 60 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Total dishes} = D_J + D_P = 60 + 30 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 90 + 90 = 180
\]

Thus, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for overlapping sets. The total number of students in Miss Susan's class is 20. We are given the following information:

- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students are good at English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, let's determine the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students is 20, and we can subtract the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only:

\[ 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Next, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:

"To determine the number of groups that can perform at the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such intervals fit into the total concert time, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the total concert duration and the intermission:
- Total concert duration: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Intermission: 10 minutes

Total time available for performances:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve the problem of determining how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can use our expertise in multiplication and division of fractions.

First, we need to find out how many rooms constitute one-half of the total 90 rooms:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, we know that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time required to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time per room:
\[
45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[
\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into a series of multiplications and additions.

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
   \]
3. In the third year, the town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. First, we calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years:
   \[

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables as follows:
- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( y \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( z \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( x = y - 3 \)
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( x = z + 2 \)
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( m = 3y - 1 \)
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( x + y + z + m = 87 \)

First, we can express \( y \) and \( z \) in terms of \( x \):
- From \( x = y - 3 \), we get \( y = x + 3 \).
- From \( x = z + 2 \), we get \( z = x - 2 \).

Next, substitute \( y \) and \( z \) into the equation for \( m \):
- \( m = 3y - 1 = 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \).

Now, substitute \( y \), \( z \), and \( m \) into the sum equation:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 13 \]

Therefore, I am 13 years old.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. Each student needs 2 glue sticks, and there are 27 students:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to meet or exceed this total. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we must round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks. Rounding 6.75 up to the nearest whole number gives us 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Given the initial volume of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons, after a day of heavy rain, the volume doubles. This means the volume on the second day is \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons. On the third day, the volume increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total volume of water passing through the river on the third day is \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons.

"To model the exponential growth of the infection over discrete time steps, we can use the formula for exponential growth in a discrete context. Given that each infected person infects 6 others every day, the number of infected people at each step can be calculated using the formula:

\[ I(t) = I(0) \times (1 + r)^t \]

where:
- \( I(t) \) is the number of infected people at time \( t \),
- \( I(0) \) is the initial number of infected people,
- \( r \) is the rate of infection per time step,
- \( t \) is the number of time steps (days).

In this scenario:
- \( I(0) = 10 \) (initial infected people),
- \( r = 6 \) (each infected person infects 6 others),
- \( t = 3 \) (we want to find the number of infected people after 3 days).

However, since each infected person infects 6 others, the growth is not linear but rather multiplicative. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

\[ I(t) = I(0) \times (1 + r)^t = 10 \times 7^t \]

where \( 7 \) is the total number of people each infected person results in (1 original + 6 new).

Now, we calculate the number of infected people after 3 days:

\[ I(3) = 10 \times 7^3 \]

First, calculate \( 7^3 \):

\[ 7^3 = 7 \times 7 \times 7 = 343 \]

Then, multiply by the initial number of infected people:

\[ I(3) = 10 \times 343 = 3430 \]

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is:

"To determine the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we start by calculating the amount each received individually.

First, we calculate Rafaela's total tips. Each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip:
\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]
So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we calculate Julieta's total tips. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:
\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]
Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:
\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]
So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:
\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

"To solve this problem, we will use the principles of ratio and proportion to determine the number of badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber.

1. **Claire's Badge Earning Rate:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earning Rate:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - This means Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning Rate:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - This means Wendy earns \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) badges per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( R \) be the number of red cars.
- \( G \) be the number of green cars.
- \( B \) be the number of blue cars.
- \( Y \) be the number of yellow cars.

From the problem, we know:
1. The rink has 12 red cars:
   \[
   R = 12
   \]
2. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars:
   \[
   G = R - 2
   \]
3. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars:
   \[
   B = 3G
   \]
4. The total number of cars is 75:
   \[
   R + G + B + Y = 75
   \]

First, substitute \( R = 12 \) into the equation for \( G \):
\[
G = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

Next, substitute \( G = 10 \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[
B = 3 \times 10 = 30
\]

Now, substitute \( R = 12 \), \( G = 10 \), and \( B = 30 \) into the total number of cars equation:
\[
12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75
\]

Simplify and solve for \( Y \):
\[
52 + Y = 75
\]
\[
Y = 75 - 52
\]
\[
Y = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
23

"To solve the system of linear equations involving the number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

Thus, Fawn has 28 books.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's lawn:
     \[
     K = 3J
     \]
   - The second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's lawn:
     \[
     A = 5J
     \]
   - The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is the sum of the times she mowed each lawn:
     \[
     J + K + A = J + 3J + 5J = 9J
     \]

3. **Determine the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 for all her work, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To determine Harry's weight, we will solve this problem step-by-step using multi-step addition and subtraction.

1. **Martin's weight**: Given as 55 kg.
2. **Carl’s weight**: Carl’s weight is 16 kg more than Martin’s weight.
   \[
   \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg}
   \]
3. **Christian’s weight**: Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight.
   \[
   \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. **Harry’s weight**: Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight.
   \[
   \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Thus, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha originally had, and \( J \) represent the number of notebooks Joseph originally had.

From the problem, we know:
1. Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks.
2. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( M + 5 = 7 \)
2. \( J = 3M \)

First, solve the first equation for \( M \):
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]
\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

Now that we know Martha originally had 2 notebooks, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had:
\[ J = 3M \]
\[ J = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ J = 6 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we start by calculating the distance Anis rowed. Dijana rowed 50 miles, and Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana.

First, we calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to analyze the given information and apply our knowledge of division and ratios.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill:
   - 4 adult bowls
   - 8 child bowls

2. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, we can convert the total soup into child bowls:
   - 4 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 8 child bowls

3. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will each have one adult bowl. Therefore, the total amount of soup used for dinner is:
   - 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls

4. The total amount of soup available is 8 child bowls. After dinner, the remaining soup is:
   - 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls

5. Calvin has two children, and each child will have one bowl at a meal. Therefore, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
   - 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 times

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To determine the total amount William spent, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen.

1. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Each notebook costs $1.50.
   - William bought 5 notebooks.
   - The total cost for the notebooks is calculated as:
     \[
     5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
     \]

2. **Cost of Ballpen:**
   - Each ballpen costs $0.50.
   - William bought 1 ballpen.
   - The total cost for the ballpen is:
     \[
     1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - To find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen:

"To solve the problem of determining the total amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can set up a system of equations based on the given ratios.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the amount of material needed for one small mask.
- Let \( y \) be the amount of material needed for one large mask.

From the problem, we know:
- 4 small masks require 2 yards of material, so \( 4x = 2 \).
- 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material, so \( 3y = 2.25 \).

We can solve these equations to find \( x \) and \( y \):

1. Solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 2 \]
\[ x = \frac{2}{4} \]
\[ x = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask} \]

2. Solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 2.25 \]
\[ y = \frac{2.25}{3} \]
\[ y = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of material required for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:
- Material for 20 small masks: \( 20x = 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \text{ yards} \)
- Material for 8 large masks: \( 8y = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ yards} \)

Adding these together gives the total material needed:
\[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to perform a series of additions and subtractions based on the given information.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we add up the total hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we subtract the total hours spent on activities from 24 to find the free time:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To solve the problem, we need to translate the given information into a system of linear equations and then solve for the unknowns.

Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age and \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.
2. Duncan's current age is 60.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \)
2. \( D = 60 \)

First, substitute \( D = 60 \) into the first equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

- \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equations:
1. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had combined and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each received from their mother.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Next, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2 to find the amount each received:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to perform two key calculations: multiplication to find the distance each vehicle traveled, and subtraction to find the difference in their distances.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find the difference:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To solve the system of linear equations given in the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( L \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( J \) be the age of Jean.

We are given the following equations:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, substitute \( J = 20 \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, substitute \( J = 20 \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes:**
   - Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes:
     \[
     10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - They also have 10 boxes already:
     \[
     50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of tables needed:**
   - Each table can hold 2 boxes:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of new tables required:**
   - They already own 15 tables:
     \[
     30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables}
     \]

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is:

"To solve the problem of determining the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we will break it down into a series of steps involving multiplication and addition.

1. **Calculate the hay needed for the goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Calculate the hay needed for the sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the total hay needed:**

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

We can solve this system step by step. First, we express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From the second equation:
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation:
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( A \) and \( D \) into the first equation:
\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45
\]
\[
3B - 30 = 45
\]

Add 30 to both sides to isolate the term with \( B \):
\[
3B = 75
\]

Divide by 3 to solve for \( B \):
\[
B = 25
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[
A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5
\]
\[
D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To calculate the total sleep duration for Kim, we need to account for the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Total Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - This is a total of 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Time Spent Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \) minutes.

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time she woke up early is 5 minutes.

4. **Total Time Subtracted from Sleep:**
   - Total time subtracted = Time spent sleepwalking + Time woke up early
   - Total time subtracted = 23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes.

5. **Total Sleep Time on the Bed:**
   - Total sleep time on the bed = Total usual sleep duration - Total time subtracted
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Given that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Next, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
\text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[
\text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34
\]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in calculating percentages, multiplication, and subtraction.

First, we calculate the initial number of occupied beds. The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we determine the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"To solve this multi-step word problem involving multiplication, we first need to establish the relationships between the ages of the individuals mentioned.

1. **Determine Shawna's age:**
   - We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
   - Aliya is 3 years old.
   - Therefore, Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

2. **Determine Shawna's father's age:**
   - We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
   - Shawna is 9 years old.
   - Therefore, Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

Thus, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the percentage decrease from Courtney's reported number. Kelly stated that Courtney overstated the number by 20%. This means that the reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \). According to the problem, 120% of \( x \) is 48. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables as follows:
- Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
- Let \( x \) represent the number of balls Jason carried.
- Let \( y \) represent the number of balls Jordan carried.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey: \( x = 2J \).
2. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason: \( y = 2x \).
3. Jason carried 2 balls: \( x = 2 \).

First, substitute \( x = 2 \) into the equation \( x = 2J \):
\[ 2 = 2J \]
\[ J = 1 \]

Next, substitute \( x = 2 \) into the equation \( y = 2x \):
\[ y = 2 \times 2 \]
\[ y = 4 \]

Now, we have the number of balls each person carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( x = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( y = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan:
\[ J + x + y = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Holes Dug on the First Three Days:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Total Holes by the End of the Fourth Day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Holes Dug on the Fourth Day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of corn chips each of the two people who received an equal amount as \( x \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so \( x = 70 \).

The third person, Collins, received 15 more corn chips than the others, so Collins received \( x + 15 \) corn chips. Substituting \( x = 70 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ x + 15 = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we sum the amounts received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe, \( S \) represent the number of Pokemon caught by Stan, and \( X \) represent the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

The problem provides the following information:
1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( A \).

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

Thus, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction, considering the varying speeds and directions of the bird's flight.

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first calculate the total cost of the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as \( R \), Jerry has as \( J \), and Robert has as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of cherries is 60.
2. Robert has 30 cherries.
3. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( R + J + B = 60 \)
2. \( B = 30 \)
3. \( B = R + 10 \)

First, substitute \( B = 30 \) into the third equation to find \( R \):
\[ 30 = R + 10 \]
\[ R = 30 - 10 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( R = 20 \) into the first equation to find \( J \):
\[ 20 + J + 30 = 60 \]
\[ J + 50 = 60 \]
\[ J = 60 - 50 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
\[ B - J = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( G_s \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_s \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_u \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_u \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
   \[
   G_s = 10
   \]

2. On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
   \[
   A_s = A_u - 4
   \]

3. On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday.
   \[
   G_u = G_s + 5
   \]

4. On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie.
   \[
   A_u = 15
   \]

Using these equations, we can substitute the known values to find the unknowns:

- From \( G_s = 10 \):
  \[
  G_u = 10 + 5 = 15
  \]

- From \( A_u = 15 \):
  \[
  A_s = 15 - 4 = 11
  \]

Now, we have the number of boxes sold each day:
- Saturday: \( G_s = 10 \) boxes of gingerbread, \( A_s = 11 \) boxes of apple pie
- Sunday: \( G_u = 15 \) boxes of gingerbread, \( A_u = 15 \) boxes of apple pie

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each type of item:

- Earnings from gingerbread:
  \[
  \text{Total gingerbread boxes} = G_s + G_u = 10 + 15 = 25
  \]
  \[
  \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = 25 \times 6 = 150
  \]

- Earnings from apple pie:
  \[
  \text{Total apple pie boxes} = A_s + A_u = 11 + 15 = 26
  \]
  \[
  \text{Earnings from apple pie} = 26 \times 15 = 390

   - Therefore, her daily usage is \( 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \).

2. **Calculate the total usage over 8 days:**
   - She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.
   - She is on vacation for 8 days.
   - Therefore, her total usage is \( 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \).

3. **Determine the number of 8-ounce bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - She needs 32 ounces in total.
   - Therefore, the number of bottles required is \( \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \).

Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"To determine the total cost of both the red car and the blue car, we start by calculating the price of the red car, which is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

The red car is 40% cheaper, so it costs 60% of the blue car's price:
\[ \text{Price of the red car} = 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

Next, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Thus, the total cost of both cars is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( E \) be Emil's current age.
- \( D \) be Emil's dad's current age.
- \( B \) be Emil's brother's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
   \[
   E = 19
   \]

2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5)
   \]
   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   24 = \frac{D + 5}{2}
   \]
   \[
   48 = D + 5
   \]
   \[
   D = 43
   \]

3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   \[
   24 = 2 (B + 5)
   \]
   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   24 = 2B + 10
   \]
   \[
   14 = 2B
   \]
   \[
   B = 7
   \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother currently:
\[
D + B = 43 + 7 = 50
\]

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:

"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we can break down the contributions from each source and then sum them up using addition and multiplication.

1. **Beads from her mother**: 20 beads.
2. **Beads from her sister**: Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother. Therefore, the number of beads from her sister is:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ beads}
   \]
3. **Beads from her friend**: Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Therefore, the number of beads from her friend is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the beads:
\[
20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \text{ beads}
\]

Thus, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:

"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total weight of crawfish caught over the three days and then divide by the weight of one serving.

1. **Thursday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

2. **Friday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday.
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Saturday's Catch:**
   Joe caught half the amount he caught on Friday.
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Total Catch:**
   Add the amounts from Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
   \[
   3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Number of Servings:**
   Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total catch by 3.
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}
   \]

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first calculate the number of football players and then the number of cheerleaders or band members from the remaining students.

1. Calculate the number of football players:
   - 20% of 30 students are football players.
   - \( 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \) students are football players.

2. Calculate the number of remaining students after the football players leave:
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \) students remain.

3. Calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members from the remaining students:
   - 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or band members.
   - \( 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \) students are cheerleaders or band members.

4. Calculate the total number of students leaving early:

"To determine the total cost Pat will incur to fill her flower bed, we need to follow a series of calculations involving area, unit conversions, and cost. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy is 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

\(\boxed{162}\)"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic principles of multiplication and division. Given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother, who eats half as many, would consume:

"To determine the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we can break down the problem into smaller steps, focusing on multiplication and addition.

1. **Cost of Petunias for One Basket:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias per basket.
   - Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. **Cost of Sweet Potato Vines for One Basket:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
   - Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. **Total Cost for One Basket:**
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. **Total Cost for All 5 Baskets:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then determine how much soil remains for the roses.

First, calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the soil used for the carnations:
- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

Subtract the total soil used from the initial amount of soil:
- They start with a 30-pound bag of soil.
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first calculate the monthly amount she sets aside for shoes. Given that Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes:

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we calculate her annual savings for shoes by multiplying her monthly savings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy in a year is:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

"To solve the problem of determining how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

### Peeling the Shrimp
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To find the time required to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
  \[
  \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Rate of peeling}}
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Cooking the Shrimp
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To find the time required to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine the number of batches:
  \[
  \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per batch}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
  \]
- Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
  \[
  \text{Time to cook} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Total Time
- The total time to complete both tasks is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
  \[
  \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To determine the final temperature change, we need to consider the cooling and warming rates over the specified time periods.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature change is \( 2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees} \).

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature change is \( 3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees} \).

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature change is \( 2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees} \).

Next, we sum the temperature changes to find the net effect:
- Total cooling: \( 6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees} \).
- Total warming: \( 4 \, \text{degrees} \).

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees} \).

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and apply our understanding of age and time relationships.

1. **Identify the key information:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

2. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet at age 30.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time at \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley has a 75-year orbit, the second sighting occurred 75 years after the first sighting.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet appears every 75 years, then he must have seen it for the first time when he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month. Since there are 12 months in a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month. Similarly, for 12 months:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks per month. For 12 months:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check per quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Now, we sum the total number of checks:
\[
12 \text{ checks/year} + 12 \text{ checks/year} + 24 \text{ checks/year} + 4 \text{ checks/year} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"To solve the problem, we need to set up and solve equations involving fractions and proportions. Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Flights to Greece} = \frac{3}{4}F \]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{1}{2} \left( F - \frac{3}{4}F \right) \]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ F - \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{1}{4}F \]

Thus, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}F \right) = \frac{1}{8}F \]

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we can use our expertise in addition and multiplication to solve this problem step by step.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve for the age of Wilfred, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

From the total age of the children, we have:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we start by defining the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices, in terms of \( x \), is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Thus, the total watermelon is \( 8x \).

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so the number of chocolate bars she sold is \( 3.5x \).
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so the number of chocolate bars he sold is \( 4.5x \).

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Thus, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

Let \( p \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes, and \( m \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.

From the problem, we have:
1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars:
   \[
   4p = 64
   \]
2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars:
   \[
   7m = 56
   \]

We can solve these equations to find \( p \) and \( m \).

First, solve for \( p \):
\[
4p = 64 \implies p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[
7m = 56 \implies m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow a series of calculations involving percentages, multiplication, and addition. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   \[
   \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   \[
   \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. **Calculate the total population after a year:**
   - The initial population is 50.
   - Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population.
   \[
   \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

Thus, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:
\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool and then convert that volume into gallons. Finally, we will calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   Substituting these values into the formula:
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert cubic feet to gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]"
"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( R \) represent the number of red sticks.
2. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue sticks.
3. Let \( Y \) represent the number of yellow sticks.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- There are 9 red sticks: \( R = 9 \)
- There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks: \( B = R + 5 \)
- The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks: \( Y = B - 3 \)

First, substitute the value of \( R \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, substitute the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( Y \):
\[ Y = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = R + B + Y = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first calculate the distance each traveled using the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
- Speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours
- Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps, focusing on the fractions and the total capacity of the tank.

1. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park. We will use the given rates of charge loss to reverse the process step by step.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.28}{(0.93)^3} = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
     \]
   - So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

2. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{0.348}{(0.91)^5} = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
     \]
   - So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   - The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   - Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. 

- The cost of 3 peaches at $0.50 each is \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\).
- The cost of 4 pears at $0.50 each is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\).
- The cost of 2 kiwis at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).
- The cost of 5 apples at $0.75 each is \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\).

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits already purchased:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. She had 15 packs and kept 2 for herself, so the number of packs given away is:

\[ 15 - 2 = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Next, we determine the total number of pieces in these 13 packs. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 13 \times 60 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received. Anne has 10 friends, so:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the compound interest formula:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the factor by which the price will increase:

\[ 1 + r = 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this factor to the power of the number of years:

\[ (1.05)^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this factor by the initial price to find the future price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years will be:

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and multiplication. James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages.

First, we set up the ratio of pages to time:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

We want to find the time \( t \) it takes to read 18 pages. We can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{t \text{ minutes}} \]

To solve for \( t \), we cross-multiply:
\[ 3t = 18 \times 10 \]
\[ 3t = 180 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ t = \frac{180}{3} \]
\[ t = 60 \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in addition and subtraction to track the changes in the number of guests at the hotel throughout the day.

1. **Initial number of guests**: 100
2. **Early checkouts**: 24 guests leave, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. **Late checkouts**: 15 guests leave, so we subtract 15 from 76:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. **Afternoon check-ins**: Twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. **Evening check-ins**: 7 more people check in after dinner, so we add 7 to 91:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). We are given that \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold, and \( 2x \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed by the equation:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily ore mining rate for a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the rate doubles: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the rate increases by 50% compared to the iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the daily ore mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - If one dwarf mines 36 pounds per day, 40 dwarves will mine: \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined in 30 days:**
   - If 40 dwarves mine 1440 pounds per day, in 30 days they will mine: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

"To solve the problem of finding the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the concept of unit rates and proportions. Given the prices for the other packages, we can determine the cost per sandwich and then apply that rate to the 8-sandwich package.

First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the given packages:
- The first package: 2 sandwiches for $3
  \[
  \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

- The second package: 4 sandwiches for $6
  \[
  \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the cost per sandwich is consistent across the two packages, we can use this rate to find the cost of the 8-sandwich package:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the conditional probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Probability of a Substitute Teacher:**
   - \( P(\text{Substitute}) = 0.50 \)
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Probability of the Normal Teacher:**
   - \( P(\text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.50 \)
   - Given the normal teacher is present, there are two further scenarios to consider:
     - **Probability of an Extension for the Whole Class:**
       - \( P(\text{Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.40 \)
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
     - **Probability of No Extension for the Whole Class:**
       - \( P(\text{No Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.60 \)
       - Given no extension for the whole class, there is a chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment:
         - **Probability of a Personal Extension:**
           - \( P(\text{Personal Extension} \mid \text{No Extension}) = 0.20 \)
           - If Marcus gets a personal extension, he does not have to turn in his homework.

Now, we calculate the total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

- **Probability of a Substitute Teacher:**
  \[
  P(\text{Substitute}) = 0.50
  \]

- **Probability of an Extension for the Whole Class:**
  \[
  P(\text{Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.40 \times 0.50 = 0.20
  \]

- **Probability of a Personal Extension:**
  \[
  P(\text{Personal Extension} \mid \text{No Extension}) \times P(\text{No Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 \times 0.50 = 0.06
  \]

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[
P(\text{No Homework}) = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76
\]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
\[
P(\text{Homework}) = 1 - P(\text{No Homework}) = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24
\]

The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[
24\%
\]

"To solve this problem, we need to perform two primary operations: subtraction and division. First, we will subtract the number of seats allocated for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find the number of seats available for friends and family. Then, we will divide this number by the number of graduates to determine how many tickets each graduate can distribute.

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family:
\[ \text{Total seats} = 6000 \]
\[ \text{Seats for graduates} = 950 \]
\[ \text{Seats for faculty} = 300 \]
\[ \text{Seats for friends and family} = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

2. Divide the number of seats for friends and family by the number of graduates:
\[ \text{Number of tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the relationships between the sizes of the jelly beans and the quantities Grandpa can consume. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

2. **Convert the number of medium-sized beans to small beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To determine Melissa's hourly rate after expenses for her jury duty, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate Total Hours Worked:**
   Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 18 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 15 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 45 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Total Expenses:**
   Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 3 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 9 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate Net Earnings:**
   Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings.
   \[
   \text{Net earnings} = 45 \, \text{dollars} - 9 \, \text{dollars} = 36 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate Hourly Rate After Expenses:**
   Divide the net earnings by the total hours worked.
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{36 \, \text{dollars}}{18 \, \text{hours}} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour}
   \]

Therefore, Melissa's hourly rate after expenses is \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour."
"To determine the total amount Ted spent, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils.

First, we calculate the total cost of the books:
- Ted buys 3 books, each costing $16.
- The total cost for the books is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils:
- Ted buys 3 pencils, each costing $6.
- The total cost for the pencils is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts to find the total expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost of books + Cost of pencils
- Total cost = 48 + 18 = 66 dollars

Therefore, the total amount Ted spent is 66 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Richard to set off all the soda fountains by placing the candy in each bottle. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

3. **Total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle and drops the candy immediately, so no additional time is needed for the first bottle.
   - The total time is the time to move between all the bottles.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To calculate the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we start by determining the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet in length and 8 feet in width. Each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we find the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we calculate the total area required:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

The second person received $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person received twice what the second person received, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step.

First, expand and combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, isolate the variable \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can write the equation for the total number of balls as:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x = 30 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of slices Becky ate.
2. Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
3. Let \( S \) represent the number of slices Silvia ate.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake: \( B = J + 3 \)
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake: \( S = 2J \)
- Becky ate 10 slices: \( B = 10 \)

We can substitute \( B = 10 \) into the first equation to find \( J \):
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

Now, we can use \( J = 7 \) to find \( S \):
\[ S = 2J \]
\[ S = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ S = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = B + J + S \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 10 + 7 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let \( D \) represent the time in minutes that Donovan took to complete his part of the meal, and let \( B \) represent the time in minutes that Betsy took to complete her part.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part: \( B = D + 18 \).
2. The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes: \( B + D = 98 \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( D \):

\[ (D + 18) + D = 98 \]

Simplify and combine like terms:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( B \) using the first equation:

\[ B = D + 18 \]
\[ B = 40 + 18 \]
\[ B = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we will use multiplication and addition to find the total cost of mailing the coupons. 

First, we calculate the number of big coupons:
- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we add the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field at the end of a 6-hour day, we need to perform two key calculations: the total number of bales produced by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck. We will then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales produced.

1. **Total bales produced by the farmer:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales produced is \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

2. **Total bales picked up by the truck:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales picked up is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

3. **Bales left in the field:**
   - The number of bales left in the field is the difference between the bales produced and the bales picked up: \( 30 - 18 = 12 \) bales.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field at the end of the 6-hour day is 12.

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the time spent in regular classes and the additional time spent on weekends.

First, calculate the total number of periods John has in a week:
\[ 6 \text{ periods/day} + 2 \text{ extra periods/day} = 8 \text{ periods/day} \]
\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total minutes spent in class each week is:
\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John spends an additional \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday. The extra learning time for each day is:
\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the extra learning time to the regular class time gives the total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

"To determine the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we can use the properties of a geometric sequence. In this scenario, the height of each bounce forms a geometric sequence where the common ratio is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

1. **Initial Height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial height \( a_1 \) is \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) feet.

2. **First Bounce:**
   - The height after the first bounce is given by the first term of the geometric sequence multiplied by the common ratio.
   - \( a_2 = a_1 \times \frac{2}{3} = 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \) feet.

3. **Second Bounce:**
   - The height after the second bounce is given by the second term of the geometric sequence multiplied by the common ratio.
   - \( a_3 = a_2 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \) feet.

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is 32 feet.

"To determine the height of the fourth child in inches, we will follow the given information step by step, converting and performing the necessary arithmetic operations.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert the height to inches:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:
\[
72 \text{ inches}

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic principles of division and multiplication. 

First, we determine the number of bags sold. Given that the orchard sold 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings. Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final amount of meat left, which is 270 kilograms, to find the original weight of the triceratops. This involves reversing the steps of the consumption by the T-Rex and the velociraptors.

1. **Step 1: Determine the amount of meat before the Allosaurus ate.**
   - The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors.
   - Therefore, the amount of meat before the Allosaurus ate is:
     \[
     270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

2. **Step 2: Determine the amount of meat before the velociraptors scavenged.**
   - The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex, so the 540 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex.
   - Therefore, the amount of meat before the velociraptors scavenged is:
     \[
     540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

3. **Step 3: Determine the original weight of the triceratops.**
   - The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 1080 kilograms is half of the original weight.
   - Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops is:
     \[
     1080 \times 2 = 2160 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

Thus, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 2160 kilograms.

"To calculate the total cost to paint the room, we need to determine the total area of the walls and then calculate the amount of paint required based on the coverage rate, and finally, the total cost based on the price per gallon.

1. **Calculate the area of the walls:**
   - The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.
   - The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.
   - Total area of all four walls = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

2. **Determine the amount of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 9

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen took 1 unshaken soda.
   - Remaining sodas: 11
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Remaining sodas: 8
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 2
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 6

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:
   \[
   P(\text{Shaken Soda}) = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   \[
   P(\text{Shaken Soda}) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%

"To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances. 

The first train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance it covers in 3 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. The distance it covers in 3 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the shares of apples that Pierre and Paul will take and then find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left.

First, let's calculate Pierre's share:
- Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
  \[
  \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
  \]

Next, let's calculate Paul's share:
- Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We know that the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Let's denote the unknown time it takes to blink 459 times as \( t \) minutes.

The proportion can be set up as follows:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{t \text{ minutes}}
\]

To solve for \( t \), we cross-multiply and solve the resulting equation:

\[
255 \times t = 459 \times 5
\]

\[
255t = 2295
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 255 to isolate \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
t = 9
\]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in addition and subtraction to determine the difference between the number of female and male fish in Tate's garden pond after the purchase.

First, let's calculate the initial number of male and female fish:

- Initial male guppies: 4
- Initial female guppies: 7
- Initial male goldfish: 3
- Initial female goldfish: 5

Next, we add the fish that Tate buys:

- Additional male guppies: 2
- Additional female guppies: 1
- Additional male goldfish: 2
- Additional female goldfish: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase:

- Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Total male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
- Total female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

Next, we sum the total number of male and female fish:

- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female and male fish:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate of the fifth worker. We know the total number of toys required, the production rates of the other four workers, and the total number of hours worked.

1. **Calculate the total production by the first four workers:**
   - Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Combined, the four workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production by the four workers over 10 hours:**
   - Total production by the four workers in 10 hours: \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total number of toys produced by all five workers:**
   - The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys.
   - Therefore, the number of toys produced by the end of the shift: \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Total production by the four workers: 200 toys.
   - Total production by all five workers: 380 toys.
   - Production by the fifth worker: \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Determine the hourly production of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours.
   - Hourly production of the fifth worker: \(\frac{180}{10} = 18\) toys per hour.

The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in fractions and addition to determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs.

Given:
- Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.
- Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog.
- Elijah has another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog.

First, we calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's start with the final piece of information and move step by step to the beginning.

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.**
   - Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob and kept 9 stickers for himself.
   - Therefore, Kris had \( 7 + 9 = 16 \) stickers before giving any to Rob.

2. **Kris received the 16 stickers from Luis.**
   - Kris received these 16 stickers after Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth.
   - Let \( L \) be the number of stickers Luis received from Seth.
   - Luis used half of \( L \), so he used \( \frac{L}{2} \) stickers.
   - The remaining stickers Luis gave to Kris are \( \frac{L}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( \frac{L}{2} = 16 \).

3. **Solve for \( L \):**
   \[
   \frac{L}{2} = 16
   \]
   \[
   L = 16 \times 2 = 32
   \]

4. **Luis received 32 stickers from Seth.**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{S}{2} = 32 \).

5. **Solve for \( S \):**
   \[
   \frac{S}{2} = 32
   \]
   \[
   S = 32 \times 2 = 64
   \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the Earth's circumference.

1. **Calculate half of the Earth's circumference:**
   The circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the Earth's circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days required:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. We know that Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
14 = 2V
\]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[
7 + 2 = 9
\]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A \) represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Let \( M \) represent the number of eggs Madeline painted.
3. Let \( C \) represent the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Let \( S \) represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
   \[
   A + M + C + S = 56
   \]

2. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:
   \[
   A = M
   \]

3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
   \[
   C + S = 30
   \]

4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah:
   \[
   C = S + 12
   \]

We can substitute \( A = M \) into the first equation:
\[
A + A + C + S = 56
\]
\[
2A + C + S = 56
\]

Next, we substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[
(S + 12) + S = 30
\]
\[
2S + 12 = 30
\]
\[
2S = 18
\]
\[
S = 9
\]

Now that we have \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[
C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
\]

Substitute \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \) into the equation \( 2A + C + S = 56 \):
\[
2A + 21 + 9 = 56
\]
\[
2A + 30 = 56
\]
\[
2A = 26
\]
\[
A = 13
\]

Since \( A = M \), we have \( M = 13 \).

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[
C - A = 21 - 13 = 8
\]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

   Since each group of 8 crayons is placed in one box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, \( T_2 \), such that when mixed with the water from the first mug, the final temperature \( T_f \) is at least 40 degrees.

Given:
- The temperature of the water in the first mug, \( T_1 \), is 33 degrees.
- Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.
- The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 = 4 \) ounces (volume from the first mug)
- \( m_2 = 1 \) ounce (volume from the second mug)

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We need \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Let's translate these statements into equations:

1. Gomer ate \( s = 23 - 5 \) scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   s = 18
   \]

2. It takes \( p = 6 - 3 \) potatoes to make \( s = 3 - 1 \) scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   p = 3 \quad \text{potatoes to make} \quad s = 2 \quad \text{scoops}
   \]

Now, we need to find how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{54}{2}
\]

\[
x = 27
\]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts and then combine the results.

First, calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs eaten in 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of individual sunflowers sold per day.
- \( y \) as the number of bouquets sold per day.

From the problem, we know:
1. Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
2. Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
3. Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. \( 2x = 26 \) (Equation for individual sunflowers)
2. \( 8y = 56 \) (Equation for bouquets)

First, solve for \( x \) and \( y \):
\[ 2x = 26 \]
\[ x = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

\[ 8y = 56 \]
\[ y = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Next, calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Individual sunflowers sold per day: \( x = 13 \)
- Sunflowers in bouquets sold per day: \( 12y = 12 \times 7 = 84 \)

Total sunflowers sold per day:
\[ 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Finally, calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291.

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then calculate the combined probability for both independent events.

1. The probability that the first lottery ticket wins is 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket wins is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

Since the events are independent, the combined probability that both tickets win is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[
0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.12 \times 100 = 12\%

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
2. Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
3. Let \( R \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( J = 27 \) (Jim collected 27 seashells)
2. \( J = C + 5 \) (Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos)
3. \( C = 2R \) (Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey)

First, substitute \( J = 27 \) into the second equation:
\[ 27 = C + 5 \]

Solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 27 - 5 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

Next, substitute \( C = 22 \) into the third equation:
\[ 22 = 2R \]

Solve for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ R = 11 \]

Now, we have the number of seashells each person collected:
- Jim: \( J = 27 \)
- Carlos: \( C = 22 \)
- Carrey: \( R = 11 \)

The total number of seashells collected is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to analyze the production pattern and sum the fruits produced each year.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits (no production).
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

To find the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation. From the first relationship, we have \( R = 4B \). From the second relationship, we can solve for \( Y \) as \( Y = B + 7 \).

Substituting these into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B = 5 \), we can find \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
\[ Y = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the initial amounts of money Ronnie and Rissa have. Ronnie is given $5, and Rissa is given three times as much, which is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money each of them gives to their little sister. Let \( x \) be the amount of money each gives to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount of money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gives $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, given the total amount of paint and the distribution of colors.

1. The mural is half yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

2. The remaining half of the mural is divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints. Therefore, the total amount of paint for these three colors is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, each color uses:
   \[
   \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"To solve this problem, we can recognize that the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day forms a geometric sequence. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio.

Given:
- The first term \( a = 3 \) (the number of puffs on Monday).
- The common ratio \( r = 2 \) (each day, the number of puffs doubles).

The number of puffs on each day can be expressed as:
- Monday: \( a_1 = 3 \)
- Tuesday: \( a_2 = 3 \times 2 = 6 \)
- Wednesday: \( a_3 = 3 \times 2^2 = 12 \)
- Thursday: \( a_4 = 3 \times 2^3 = 24 \)
- Friday: \( a_5 = 3 \times 2^4 = 48 \)

To find the total number of puffs counted over the five days, we sum the terms of the geometric sequence:
\[ S_5 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 \]

Using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

For \( n = 5 \), \( a = 3 \), and \( r = 2 \):
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{2^5 - 1}{2 - 1} \]
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{32 - 1}{1} \]
\[ S_5 = 3 \times 31 \]
\[ S_5 = 93 \]

Therefore, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

"To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps, applying our expertise in multi-step arithmetic and basic financial concepts.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"To solve this multi-step word problem, we will break it down into smaller parts and use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as needed.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A. Therefore, Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

"To solve the problem, we will set up a system of equations based on the given information and solve for the unknowns.

Let \( W \) represent Wendy's current age and \( C \) represent Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we will expand and simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Finally, divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve the problem, we start by translating the given statement into a linear equation. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40"" can be written as:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Here, \( x \) represents the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge. To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by first subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

"To determine the distance the last dog needs to walk, we can use the concept of the average. The average distance walked by the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. This means the total distance walked by all 4 dogs combined is:

\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We know the distances walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these distances together gives:

\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance walked by the last dog, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow a series of calculations based on the given dimensions and properties of the jar and jelly beans.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by the jelly beans.
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}

"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two main periods: before and after the price increase.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of visits before the price increase
- **Number of visits per year:** 3
- **Cost per visit before the increase:** $2
- **Number of years before the increase:** 5

The total cost for the visits before the price increase is calculated as:
\[ \text{Total cost before increase} = 3 \, \text{visits/year} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/visit} \times 5 \, \text{years} \]
\[ \text{Total cost before increase} = 3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the new cost per visit after the price increase
- **Percentage increase in cost:** 150%
- **Original cost per visit:** $2

The increase in cost is:
\[ \text{Increase in cost} = 150\% \times 2 \, \text{dollars} = 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \, \text{dollars} \]

The new cost per visit is:
\[ \text{New cost per visit} = 2 \, \text{dollars} + 3 \, \text{dollars} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of visits after the price increase
- **Number of visits per year:** 3
- **Cost per visit after the increase:** $5
- **Number of years after the increase:** 3

The total cost for the visits after the price increase is calculated as:
\[ \text{Total cost after increase} = 3 \, \text{visits/year} \times 5 \, \text{dollars/visit} \times 3 \, \text{years} \]
\[ \text{Total cost after increase} = 3 \times 5 \times 3 = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for all visits
The total cost for all visits is the sum of the costs before and after the price increase:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost before increase} + \text{Total cost after increase} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 30 \, \text{dollars} + 45 \, \text{dollars} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

"To determine the total amount Ali has to pay John, we can break down the calculation into two parts: the cost of the wooden tables and the cost of the roof frames.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- Therefore, the total cost for the tables is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John manufactured 2 roof frames.
- Each frame costs $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for the frames is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of tables + Cost of frames
- Total cost = \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) dollars

Thus, Ali has to pay John $100.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the length of the shorter piece of the board. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \).

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a ratio to determine the amount of secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need for 80 meatballs. We know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, and he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat.

First, let's find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs:
\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we use the ratio of seasoning to ground beef to find the total amount of seasoning needed:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Pounds of ground beef} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes, and \( b \) represent the number of brownies she makes.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats is:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
b = 3c - 2 \\
c + b = 10
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Simplify and solve for \( c \):
\[
c + 3c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c = 12
\]
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has,
- \( S \) represent the number of paintings Shelley has,
- \( M \) represent the number of paintings Samantha has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings: \( M = 27 \).

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Solving for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

"To determine the final price of the toy after the specified changes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%.
   - To calculate the new price, we use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + (\text{Original Price} \times \text{Percentage Increase})
     \]
   - Here, the original price is $40 and the percentage increase is 80% (or 0.80 in decimal form).
   - Therefore, the increase in price is:
     \[
     40 \times 0.80 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - The new price in December is $72.

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%.
   - To calculate the new price, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} - (\text{Original Price} \times \text{Percentage Decrease})
     \]
   - Here, the original price is $72 and the percentage decrease is 50% (or 0.50 in decimal form).
   - Therefore, the decrease in price is:
     \[
     72 \times 0.50 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this from the original price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36
     \]
   - The new price in January is $36.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, given that 9 novels represent 3 quarters of that total. We can use the relationship between fractions and multiplication to find the solution.

Given:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

To isolate the number of novels this year, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

Thus, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes and \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
   \[
   B = 5S - 4
   \]
2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   \[
   S + B = 116
   \]

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
S + (5S - 4) = 116
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
6S - 4 = 116
\]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[
6S = 120

"To determine the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and then sum these times.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's sum the times for each side:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

     J_{\text{current}} = J_{\text{before}} + 3
     \]
   - Substituting the value of \( J_{\text{current}} \):
     \[
     70 = J_{\text{before}} + 3
     \]
   - Solving for \( J_{\text{before}} \):
     \[
     J_{\text{before}} = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches}

2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised \(430 + 320 = 750\) dollars.
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised \(300 + 400 = 700\) dollars.

Now, we add the amounts raised by all four girls:

\[
430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

First, add 430 and 750:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]

Next, add 300 to the result:

\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]

Finally, add 700 to the result:

\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

So, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:

2180"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information about the speeds and distances run by Aaron and Vanessa.

Let's denote:
- \( v_A \) as Aaron's speed in miles per minute.
- \( v_V \) as Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
- \( d_A \) as the distance Aaron ran in miles.
- \( d_V \) as the distance Vanessa ran in miles.
- \( t_A \) as the time Aaron took to complete his part of the race in minutes.
- \( t_V \) as the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race in minutes.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( d_V = 4 \) miles.
2. \( d_V = 2 \times d_A \) (Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron).
3. \( t_A = 16 \) minutes.
4. \( v_A = 2 \times v_V \) (Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa).

First, we can find \( d_A \) using the second piece of information:
\[ d_V = 2 \times d_A \]
\[ 4 = 2 \times d_A \]
\[ d_A = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we use the first piece of information to find \( v_A \):
\[ t_A = \frac{d_A}{v_A} \]
\[ 16 = \frac{2}{v_A} \]
\[ v_A = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, using the fourth piece of information, we find \( v_V \):
\[ v_A = 2 \times v_V \]
\[ \frac{1}{8} = 2 \times v_V \]
\[ v_V = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Finally, we use the third piece of information to find \( t_V \):
\[ t_V = \frac{d_V}{v_V} \]
\[ t_V = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} \]
\[ t_V = 4 \times 16 \]
\[ t_V = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic principles of multiplication and subtraction. The caretaker requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Given that there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more line is needed, we subtract the line he already has from the total required:

\[ 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To determine the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to perform a series of multiplications and additions based on the given information.

1. **Calculate the revenue per reservation:**
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
   - Each reservation also orders a $5 bottle of wine.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from one reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue per night:**
   - The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - The total revenue for one night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - The total weekly revenue is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:
180"
"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**
   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Determine the total profit:**
   - The profit margin is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, focusing on the age relationships:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to analyze their peeling rates and then calculate the difference in the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

1. **Determine the peeling rates:**
   - Ana's peeling rate: 1 orange every 3 minutes.
   - Jane's peeling rate: 1 orange every 4 minutes.

2. **Convert these rates to the number of oranges peeled per hour:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Ana's rate in oranges per hour: \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges/hour} \).
   - Jane's rate in oranges per hour: \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges/hour} \).

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - Difference: \( 20 \text{ oranges/hour} - 15 \text{ oranges/hour} = 5 \text{ oranges} \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the total cost Mark paid for the new radiator and its installation, we need to break down the expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of the Radiator:**
   - Original price of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of Mechanic's Labor:**
   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Cost of the radiator: $80
   - Cost of labor: $150
   - Total amount paid: \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve the problem of determining the number of chickens and cows on Farmer Brown's farm, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's define the variables:
- \( c \) represents the number of chickens.
- \( k \) represents the number of cows.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

This gives us the following system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza each person will get if the pizzas are shared equally among Henry and his three friends. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends):

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.
