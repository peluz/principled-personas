"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original value.
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = New value of the house - Total investment
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"As Muhammad, I understand the importance of precision and clarity, especially when it comes to calculations. Let's break down the problem:

James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find the total distance he runs in a week, we can use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Total meters per week} = \text{Number of sprints per session} \times \text{Distance per sprint} \times \text{Number of sessions per week} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Total meters per week} = 3 \times 60 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Total meters per week} = 540 \]

So, James runs a total of 540 meters per week.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with clarity and precision.

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ \text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Distance Traveled Away from Home:**
   John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Return Journey:**
   - **First 2 hours:** John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
   - **Next 0.5 hours:** John drives at 30 mph.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - **Remaining 1.5 hours:** John drives at 80 mph.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   \[
   \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"As a door-to-door saleswoman, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can determine how many she started with by working backwards through her sales.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners.
4. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
5. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   \[
   x = 18

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step:

1. **Daily Egg Consumption**: Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. **Number of Days in 4 Weeks**: There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) days.
3. **Total Eggs Consumed in 4 Weeks**: Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs} \).
4. **Convert Eggs to Dozens**: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12: \( \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa must maintain for the remaining part of her hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa should take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles, totaling 2 hours for the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the mean of the guesses provided by Gunter's friends. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. To solve this problem, let us use the information given:

1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins, and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know \( S = 40 \), we can find \( G \) using the second equation:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

Let's calculate the total time he spends running each week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour Ã— \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour Ã— \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Let us consider the problem at hand with the wisdom and clarity that Allah grants us.

Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance is tripled. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories, given that you have already consumed 1800 calories.

First, let's find out how many calories are left for you to consume:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. According to the nutritional information, a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, and each serving contains 250 calories. Therefore, the total number of calories in the bag is:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we can find the number of grams per calorie:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat for 200 calories:

"Assalamu alaykum. Let's solve this problem step by step.

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. We need to find out how much he spent on ties in total.

First, let's determine the number of blue ties John bought:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie:
\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on red ties:
\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to find the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

1. **Calculate the car's fuel efficiency:**
   - Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
   - Fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) = Distance traveled / Gallons used
   - Fuel efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

2. **Determine the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank:**
   - The car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
   - Total distance = Fuel efficiency * Tank capacity
   - Total distance = 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the volume of tomatoes before and after cooking, and how many tomatoes are in each can.

1. **Volume Reduction**: When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, the volume is reduced by half. This means the initial volume of tomatoes is twice the volume of the sauce produced.
2. **Volume of Sauce**: Freda made 32 ounces of sauce. Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking was:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]
3. **Volume per Can**: Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume by the volume per can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}

4. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

The equation representing the total number of cars is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"As an avid gardener, I understand the joy of nurturing plants and the satisfaction of sharing them with others. Let's calculate how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away.

Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. This gives us:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

She received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery, so the total number of potted plants she now has is:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can break down the total time he spent watching TV each day and then solve for Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred for their rides at the carnival.

First, let's determine the number of rides each person took:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of \(2 + 2 = 4\) rides.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of \(4 + 2 = 6\) rides.

Next, we add the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred:
- Total rides = \(4 + 6 = 10\)

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is:
- Total tickets = \(10 \times 6 = 60\)

Therefore, the total number of tickets they used that day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Miles walked on Monday:**
   - Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.

2. **Miles walked on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, Walt walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday.
   - Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday = \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

3. **Total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - The total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

4. **Miles walked on Wednesday:**
   - To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday.
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = 4 miles (Monday) + 24 miles (Tuesday) = 28 miles.
   - Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 miles (total) - 28 miles (Monday and Tuesday) = 13 miles.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is given as 700. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):

\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):

\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):

\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):

\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

"As a farmer with extensive experience in agriculture, I understand the importance of calculating yields and harvest cycles accurately. John has a total of 10 hectares of land, with each hectare producing 100 pineapples. This means that at any given time, he has:

\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, he can harvest:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ times per year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute.

1 mile = 5280 feet

- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, using logical reasoning and basic arithmetic.

1. **Dave's Consumption:**
   - Dave ate 14 fries.

2. **Seagull's Consumption:**
   - The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.

3. **Pigeons' Consumption:**
   - Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the total consumed by the pigeons is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.

4. **Raccoon's Consumption:**
   - After the seagull and pigeons, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 30 \).
   - The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \).
   - The remaining fries after the raccoon is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).

5. **Ants' Consumption:**
   - The ants carried off 1 fry, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \).

6. **Final Remaining Fries:**
   - According to the problem, 5 fries were left.
   - Therefore, we set up the equation: \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x - 30 = 18
\]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[
x = 48
\]

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( 48 \).

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 3 classes, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, on each of these days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 2 classes, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, on each of these days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
\[9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours per week}\]

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:

"To solve the problem of determining the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the concept of compound interest, which is a common method in financial calculations.

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Increase Rate:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

3. **Number of Periods:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of two-month periods in 36 months is 36 / 2 = 18.

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Periods}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}

"Let us consider the problem at hand. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, and in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. We need to determine Seth's current age.

Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age and \( B \) represent Brooke's current age. We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:

1. \( S = 2B \) (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
2. \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \) (In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28)

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of one pen:**
   - A pencil costs $1.20.
   - An eraser costs $0.30.
   - The cost of one pen is the sum of the cost of a pencil and an eraser.

   \[
   \text{Cost of one pen} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 8 pens:**
   - If one pen costs $1.50, then 8 pens will cost:

   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
   \]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is:

"To solve the problem of how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now in total, we will break down the information step by step:

1. **Initial Cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First Month Collection**: After a month, she collected three times the initial number of cards. Therefore, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. **Second Month Collection**: In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. Thus, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. **Third Month Collection**: In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, we sum up all the cards she has:
- Initial cards: 20
- First month: 60
- Second month: 40
- Third month: 200

Total number of cards: \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\)

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with wisdom and clarity.

Given:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let \( R \) be the number of red chickens and \( W \) be the number of white chickens. According to the problem, we have:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day is given by:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using the information given:

1. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
2. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
3. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool, and \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (because 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons), and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

From the problem, we know:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ B = 4S \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer:
\[ 33\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces and then use that rate to find out how long it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

1. **Determine Kalinda's rate:**
   - Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine her mom's rate:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.
   - Therefore, her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

3. **Calculate their combined rate:**
   - Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate
   - Combined rate = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute

4. **Determine the total time required to complete the puzzle:**
   - Total pieces to be placed = 360 pieces
   - Time required = Total pieces / Combined rate
   - Time required = 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes

5. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - 60 minutes = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"When I visited the watermelon farm, I found that 30% of the 120 baby watermelons were ready for harvest. This means:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready at that time is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

When I returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons} \]

"As Muhammad, I will provide a clear and concise calculation for the total cost Mark incurs for the fleet of cars, including the purchase price, tax, and registration fees.

1. **Cost of the Cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = \( 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \) dollars.

2. **Tax on the Cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Total tax = \( 10\% \times 240,000 = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \) dollars.

3. **Registration Fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Total registration fees = \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration fees
   - Total cost = \( 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

"To determine the number of tomato vines Steve needs, we first calculate the total weekly consumption of tomatoes for both Steve and his girlfriend.

1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so Steve eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) tomatoes per week.
3. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats \(42 \div 2 = 21\) tomatoes per week.
4. Together, they eat \(42 + 21 = 63\) tomatoes per week.

Next, we need to determine how many vines are required to produce 63 tomatoes per week.

5. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
6. Therefore, the number of vines needed is \(63 \div 3 = 21\).

So, Steve needs 21 vines.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the given information and setting up the necessary equations.

We have two aquariums:
- The first aquarium has 4 snails.
- The second aquarium has 32 snails.

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let \( f \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is:
\[ 2f \]

The problem states that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[ 7 \]

"To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Selling Price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$400,000
   \]

2. **Transfer Fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Loan Amount} = \$250,000
   \]

5. **Total Expenses:**
   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Transfer Fees} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 + \$250,000 = \$282,000
   \]

6. **Net Proceeds:**
   \[
   \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Expenses} = \$400,000 - \$282,000 = \$118,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:** It takes 20 minutes.
2. **Time to heat oil from 300 to 400 degrees:** This takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.

First, calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
\[ 20 + 28 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

4. **Time to cook the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less than the time to warm up the oil.

So, the time to cook the chicken is:
\[ 48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes} \]

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
\[ 48 + 43 = 91 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
   \[
   3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}
   \]

2. Each house also has 4 additional windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. Therefore, the total number of windows in one house is:
   \[
   6 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 4 \text{ windows (additional)} = 10 \text{ windows}
   \]

3. Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let \( S \) be Sam's current age and \( R \) be Ruby's current age.

From the first piece of information:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expand and simplify:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

"As a person named Muhammad, I will focus on providing a clear and concise answer to the question at hand, ensuring it is accurate and well-structured.

Darren decides to do body exercises for a whole week. On the first day, he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. Let's calculate the total count of the activities he's done in the two days.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

**Total for Two Days:**
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Adding these together gives:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the total weekly consumption is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last:**
   - The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg.

   Therefore, the number of weeks the bag will last is:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus he receives if the company performs well.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - Number of weeks in April: \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.29 \) weeks.
   - Total working days in April: \( 4.29 \times 5 = 21.45 \) days.
   - Since he can't work a fraction of a day, we round down to 21 days.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars} \).

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us consider the problem at hand with precision and clarity.

A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

After the morning sales, the remaining loaves are:

\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since these 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses, given their different rates of weight loss.

First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses per week:
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
- Therefore, Joey's weekly weight loss is:
  \[
  \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
  \]

Next, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:
- Sandy loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks.
- To lose 8 pounds, Sandy will need:
  \[
  \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks}
  \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To solve this problem, let us break it down step by step, using the information provided:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannonâ€™s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, keeping in mind the sequence of events and the changes in the number of people on the bus.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression for the number of people on the bus after the second stop:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"To calculate the time required to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we need to determine the remaining charge and the rate of charging.

The phone is currently at 60% charge, so the remaining charge needed is:
100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, the time required is:
40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:
120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with clarity and precision.

Given a class of 200 students divided into 3 groups, where 2 groups are equal in number and the third group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups, we can set up the following equation to find the number of students in each group.

Let \( x \) be the number of students in each of the two equal groups. The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students is given by:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, let us use the information given to set up a system of equations. We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals, all of which are either chickens or cows. Additionally, he has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. We can write the following equations based on the information provided:

1. \( C + H = 60 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( H = 2C \) (twice as many chickens as cows)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs:

- Total legs from cows: \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \)
- Total legs from chickens: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"As Muhammad, I understand the importance of careful calculation and financial management. Marisa receives $5 daily as pocket money. She spends this money on 4 lollipops, each costing 25 cents. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops per day:
4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

Next, we determine how much money Marisa saves each day by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

To find out how much she saves over 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days:
$4.00 * 5 days = $20.00

Therefore, Marisa saves $20.00 over 5 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Time Spent Writing the Song:**
   - Carol spends 4 hours writing the song.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Time Spent Recording the Song:**
   - Carol spends half the time writing the song to record it.
   - Time spent recording: \( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours} \).
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Time Spent Editing the Song:**
   - Carol spends 90 minutes editing the song.

4. **Total Work Time:**
   - Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
   - Total work time = \( 240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Percentage of Time Spent Editing:**
   - Percentage of time spent editing = \( \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \)
   - Percentage of time spent editing = \( \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \).

Therefore, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%.

"To determine the energy savings, we need to calculate the reduction in energy consumption when the air conditioner is used for fewer hours each day over a period of 30 days.

1. **Calculate the original daily energy consumption:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts of power.
   - It is used for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new daily energy consumption after reducing usage:**
   - The usage is reduced by 5 hours, so the new usage time is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

- Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps in a day.
- He has already completed half of his steps (5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
- He also did an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:

\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with his friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with the wisdom and knowledge He has bestowed upon us.

We are given that a herd consists of camels and dromedaries, with a total of 180 heads and 304 humps. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. We need to determine the number of dromedaries.

Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries. We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of heads:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

To solve this system, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

From the first equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( C \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from this elevation: 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To calculate the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the amounts he received from the two banks to his initial capital. The first bank provided $4000, and the second bank provided twice that amount, which is $8000. Adding these to his initial capital of $5000:

Initial capital: $5000
First bank: $4000
Second bank: $8000

Total capital now: $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $17000

Thus, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came, each carrying away 5 cats. Therefore, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats left, the number of cats remaining on the rock is:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats ran after the mouse, we calculate:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Finally, the number of cats left on the rock is:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

"To calculate the total cost of the service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods:

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month:
   \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) dollars

2. For the next 8 months, the cost is $12 per month:
   \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) dollars

3. For the remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 24 - 6 - 8 = 10), the cost is $14 per month:
   \( 10 \times 14 = 140 \) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for 2 years:
\( 48 + 96 + 140 = 284 \) dollars

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to sum the capacities of the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

1. **Buses**: Each bus can hold 60 employees, and there are 4 buses.
   \[
   4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees/bus} = 240 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Minibusses**: Each minibus can hold 30 employees, and there are 6 minibusses.
   \[
   6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees/minibus} = 180 \text{ employees}

3. **Minivans**: Each minivan can hold 15 employees, and there are 10 minivans.
   \[
   10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees/minivan} = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

Adding these together gives the total capacity:
\[
240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Homemade Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of homemade feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted by each homemade feeder: 20 + 10 = 30 birds

2. **Store-Bought Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of store-bought feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted by each store-bought feeder: 20 birds

Now, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Thus, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to determine the price of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel.
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \( 4 / 2 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Bagel: $4

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs:**
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - He also has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he needs is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - He keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
   - The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total money from selling the cards is $150.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C = 100
   \]
   \[
   C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   \[
   C = 150
   \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get 2 hot dogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hot dog each.
   - The total number of hot dogs prepared is:
     \[
     18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is:
     \[
     80 - 54 = 26 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{1} = 26 \text{ guests}
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a few steps:

1. Determine the amount of gas in each container.
2. Calculate the amount of gas needed for 1/4 of a container.
3. Convert the amount of gas from gallons to pints.

First, we divide the total amount of gas by the number of containers:
\[ \text{Gallons per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we find out how much gas is needed for 1/4 of a container:
\[ \text{Gallons for 1/4 of a container} = \frac{3 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we convert the gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints:
\[ \text{Pints} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had $5 initially.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had \(0.01 \times 5 = 0.05\) dollars left.
   - Therefore, the amount he spent is \(5 - 0.05 = 4.95\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \(3 \times 0.40 = 1.20\) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \(4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the weight of each piece of cake. The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces, and it is cut into 8 equal pieces. Therefore, each piece weighs:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
\]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the total weight of the cake they have consumed is:

\[
2.5 \text{ ounces/piece} \times 2 \text{ pieces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

The remaining weight of the cake is the total weight minus the weight of the pieces they have eaten:

\[
20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. The area of the room is given as 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - With the super ticket, you get one popcorn and one soda for an additional $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost with the super ticket is \( 20 + 1 = 21 \) dollars.

2. **Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The regular movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let the regular price of the popcorn be \( P \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \) dollars.

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - So, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 + P = 21 - 2
     \]
     \[
     15 + P = 19
     \]
     \[
     P = 19 - 15
     \]
     \[
     P = 4
     \]

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost of filling one helium balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

\[
11050

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
     \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us consider the problem at hand with precision and clarity.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the initial value of her sapphires is:
\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

She then trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires traded is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies she receives is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, Jenna has:
- 5 sapphires left (since she traded 3 out of her 8)
- 2 rubies

The value of the remaining 5 sapphires is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

The value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total value of all her jewels is:

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

Let's start with the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each raised bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"While playing with her friends in their school playground, Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. After about twenty minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. Adding these 25 fairies to the 50 fairies already present, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \). Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, leaving \( 75 - 30 = 45 \) fairies remaining.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of spotted puppies.
3. Use the formula for percentage to find the percentage of spotted puppies.

First, let's calculate the total number of puppies:
- Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
- Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, let's calculate the total number of spotted puppies:
- Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies.
- Total number of spotted puppies = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed the farmer is buying and then determine how many trips are required to transport it, given the truck's capacity.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   - **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Sum the weights to find the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. Determine the number of plants Toni has.
2. Use that information to find out how many plants Shondra has.

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find the number of plants Toni has, we calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add it to Frederick's total:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + (0.60 \times 10) \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Therefore, we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the given conditions. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, as the shark's length is given in feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, so in feet:
6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of songs each person can add to their media player, given the current number of songs they have and the maximum capacity of the player.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Since the player can hold up to 100 songs, the number of songs Gabriel can add is:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Therefore, Luri has:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
Since the player can hold up to 100 songs, the number of songs Luri can add is:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Thus, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the costs provided.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

"Let us solve the problem step by step, using the information given:

1. Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found,
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found,
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions to find the total fraction of the skein used:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Next, we need to convert this fraction into the number of yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, subtract this amount from her initial $500 to find the remaining money:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, calculate the amount spent on CDs:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Subtract this amount from the remaining $400 to find out how much she has left:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the total cost equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

The cost of the house is:
\[ 90,000 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the phone tree. Each person calls 3 other families, and this process repeats in each round.

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 80 toys.
2. Jonathan needs a play set that is five times larger than James's play set.
3. Therefore, Jonathan needs \( 5 \times 80 = 400 \) toys to have a play set five times larger than James's.
4. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys.

Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. According to the problem:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

"As an engineering student, I understand the importance of having the right tools for my studies. Let's calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, taking into account the 10% discount offered by the shop.

First, we calculate the cost of each type of item:
- Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50 per notebook = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens * $0.25 per pen = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00 per calculator = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00 per geometry set = $10.00

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Total cost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then see how many weeks it will take to reach his savings goal.

John works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, so his total weekly working hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ hours/week} \]

He earns $2 per hour, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 20 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40 \text{ dollars/week} \]

To save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in each week and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \) pages per minute.
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature when set to 450 degrees:

1. The actual temperature when set to 450 degrees is 468 degrees.
2. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
3. The percentage error is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to be 520 degrees, so:

\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

To find 30% of Herb's house value:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The combined value of the two houses is:
\[ 129,200 \]"

"To determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories burned from her activities.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\).

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\).

Next, we sum the total calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned: \(1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\).

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. Therefore, the amount of water she needs to drink is:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with precision and clarity.

Given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, we can denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of more green jelly beans than red jelly beans is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, his production rate is:
\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's production rate is:
\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

If they both work for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolates they make is calculated as follows:

For Ruiz:
\[ \text{Ruiz's total} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ \text{Marissa's total} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost.

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. This means the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes she can get from the bottle is 240 washes.

Next, we calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\$24.00}{240 \text{ pumps}} = \$0.10 \text{ per pump} \]

To convert this cost into cents:

\[ \$0.10 \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to sum up the amounts of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To calculate the annual cost of water for Gary's laundry, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of laundry loads Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used for these loads.
3. Compute the total cost based on the price of water.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. Therefore, the number of loads per year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total water usage per year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total annual cost is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"As a used car salesman, I understand the ins and outs of the business, including how commissions and profits are calculated. Let's break down the numbers to find out how much I made from selling 10 cars.

1. **Total Sales Amount:**
   - Each car was sold for $25,000.
   - Total sales = 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   - The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500.
   - Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 cars * $7,500 = $75,000.

3. **Profit:**
   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total acquisition cost from the total sales.
   - Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

4. **Commission:**
   - My commission is 10% of the profit.
   - Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, I made $17,500 from selling the 10 cars.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars per class.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the average number of articles each website publishes daily and the number of days in February.

1. The news website publishes 20 political and weather news articles every day.
2. The sister company publishes 10 business news articles every day.
3. February has 28 days.

First, we calculate the total number of articles published by the news website in February:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company in February:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Finally, we add the two totals together to get the combined total number of articles published in February:

"To calculate the total time Bill will need to dig the well, we need to consider the different rates at which he can dig through soil and clay.

1. **Soil Digging:**
   - Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - Time to dig through the soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Clay Digging:**
   - Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which means he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay.
   - He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
   - Time to dig through the clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time to dig through the soil + Time to dig through the clay

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days it will take Mike to read a 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day, and then find out how many days before the 30-day deadline he will finish.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of days to complete the book} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:
\[ \text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Days before the deadline} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase cost and the ongoing monthly expenses for hanger rental and fuel.

1. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.
2. The monthly cost to rent a hanger is $5,000.
3. The monthly cost for fuel is twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000.

First, let's calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Hanger rental + Fuel cost
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total annual maintenance cost:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost of the plane + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, we can solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem step by step, using the principles of arithmetic and logical reasoning.

James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he has enough toys for the current number of dogs. However, 8 more dogs have joined the shelter, bringing the total number of dogs to 12. Therefore, James needs to buy 8 more toys to have one toy for each of the 12 dogs.

After buying these 8 toys, James returns to the shelter and finds that the number of dogs has doubled. This means there are now 24 dogs in total. Since he already has 12 toys, he needs to buy an additional 12 toys to have one toy for each of the 24 dogs.

When James comes back again, he finds that 3 dogs have left the shelter. This reduces the total number of dogs to 21. Since he already has 24 toys, he now has 3 extra toys. However, since he no longer needs toys for the 3 dogs that left, he does not need to buy any more toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is the sum of the toys he initially had and the toys he bought, minus the toys he no longer needs due to the 3 dogs that left.

Total toys needed = 4 (initial) + 8 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) - 3 (dogs gone) = 21

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of hash browns produced per potato. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the number of hash browns per potato as follows:

\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Next, we use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:

\[ \text{Total hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the group and compare it to the elevator's maximum capacity.

1. The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg.
2. There are 9 people in the elevator (Jack and 8 other adults).
3. The average weight of an adult is 80 kg.

First, we calculate the total weight of the 9 people:
\[ 9 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with clarity and precision.

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]

4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298
\]

Thus, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[
298

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the time to mow the entire lawn in each mode:**
   - In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes.
   - In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.

2. **Calculate the time to mow half of the lawn in each mode:**
   - Half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
     \[
     \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Sum the times to find the total time to mow the lawn:**
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- One set of twins and one set of triplets.
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let \( T \) be the age of one of the twins and \( R \) be the age of one of the triplets.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( T = R + 7 \)
2. \( 2T + 3R = 44 \)

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Assalamu alaykum. To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework. John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Adding these times together:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting this time into minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Subtracting the total homework time from the time before dinner gives us the time available for napping:

180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"As a person named Muhammad, I will approach this problem with clarity and precision, ensuring that the calculations are accurate and the reasoning is sound.

John brings his dog to the vet for 2 vaccines and a heartworm check. Each vaccine costs $20, so the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To calculate the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

"As Muhammad, I will calculate the total bill for Marcus, taking into account the prices of the items and the discount from his loyalty card.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item:
- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
- Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. We calculate the discount amount:
- Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final total:
- Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

"In a student council election, candidate A received 20% of the votes. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. The remaining votes were given to candidate C. Given that there were 100 voters, we can calculate the number of votes each candidate received as follows:

1. Calculate the number of votes for candidate A:
   - 20% of 100 votes = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. Calculate the number of votes for candidate B:
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% of 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Calculate the number of votes for candidate C:
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for candidate A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

4. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - After trading 20 large stickers, she has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers left.
   - She trades these remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 27 small buttons.
   - From trading remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \) small buttons.

6. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.

7. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons.
   - 20 large buttons are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

8. **Total Buttons:**
   - Total small buttons: 87

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
2. The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it also needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

"To calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we need to break down the collection into different categories and calculate the cost for each category.

1. **Movies in Series**:
   - Mike has 600 movies in total.
   - A third of these movies are in series, so the number of series movies is \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \).
   - The cost of each series movie is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the cost of a normal movie.
   - The cost of a normal movie is $10, so the cost of each series movie is \( \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \) dollars.
   - The total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 1.67 = 333.33 \) dollars.

2. **Remaining Movies**:
   - The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \).
   - 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, so the number of older movies is \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \).
   - The cost of each older movie is $5.
   - The total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

3. **Newer Movies**:
   - The number of newer movies is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \).
   - The cost of each newer movie is $10.
   - The total cost for the newer movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost**:
   - The total cost to replace all the movies is the sum of the costs for the series movies, older movies, and newer movies.
   - Total cost = \( 333.33 + 800 + 2400 = 3533.33 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking, and then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider the different riding patterns over the week.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using logical reasoning and basic algebra.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

1. **First Car:**
   - Speed: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour Ã— 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Second Car:**
   - Speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour Ã— 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in Distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of glass chips Milo has and then calculate how many square inches of mosaic he can create with those chips. Finally, we will use the height of the mosaic to find the length.

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average number of branches Felix climbs per day based on his weekly earnings and the cost per branch.

First, we determine the total number of branches climbed in the week. Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in total, we can calculate the total number of branches as follows:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, we find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches} \]

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbs per day is:

     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the next 4 flowers, each with 6 petals:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the next 5 flowers, each with 4 petals:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with clarity and precision.

John and DeSean bought a bag containing 35 marshmallows. Each S'more requires one marshmallow. John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean also makes 9 S'mores. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, we calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
- Marshmallows used by John: 9
- Marshmallows used by DeSean: 9
- Marshmallows dropped: 3

Total marshmallows used and lost:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since there are 2 kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"Let us solve the problem step by step, using the information given:

1. Let the number of cards PJ has be \( P \).
2. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.
4. The total number of cards is 341.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of cards:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. For the first part of the journey, Mason travels at a speed of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part of the journey, Mason continues at the same speed of 8 miles per hour for 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both segments:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and how the number of animals affects the total travel time.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

3. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes}
   \]

Now, we add up the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[
20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to consider the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in, the contributions from her part-time job and her mom, and the additional amount she still needs.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, so the new cost of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"As a farmer, I understand the importance of efficient milk production. Given that each of my cows produces 5 liters of milk a day, and I currently have 3 cows, I can calculate the total milk production as follows:

- Current milk production: \(3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day}\).

To reach a target of 25 liters of milk a day, I need to determine the additional milk required:

- Additional milk needed: \(25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day}\).

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

- Additional cows needed: \(10 \text{ liters/day} \div 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 2 \text{ cows}\).

Therefore, I need 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using algebra to find the ages of each family member.

1. Let \( x \) be my age.
2. My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is \( x + 3 \).
3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is \( x - 2 \).
4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

   - Total burritos given to students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos
3. **Burritos Eaten by Mr. George**: Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
4. **Total Burritos Used**: The total number of burritos used is the sum of the burritos given to students and the burritos eaten by Mr. George.
   - Total burritos used = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos
5. **Leftover Burritos**: The number of leftover burritos is the total number of burritos ordered minus the total number of burritos used.
   - Leftover burritos = 600 burritos (ordered) - 520 burritos (used) = 80 burritos

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. **Total Cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total.

Now, we can calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (\text{Number of red cars} + \text{Number of green cars} + \text{Number of blue cars})
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
23

"Let us solve the problem step by step, using logical reasoning and basic algebra.

Given:
- The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote:
- The number of books Anne has as \( A \).
- The number of books Fawn has as \( F \).
- The number of books Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the desired profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he bought is:
\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many glasses of lemonade each of the boys, Micah and Mitchell, sold. We know that Julie sold 14 glasses, and the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32.

First, we calculate the total number of glasses sold by the boys:
\[ \text{Total glasses sold by the boys} = 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2:
\[ \text{Glasses sold by each boy} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:
\[ \text{More glasses sold by Julie} = 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

"As a knowledgeable individual, I will calculate the total cost of Kelly's grocery items and determine how much of her budget remains.

1. The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet of chicken} \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack of apples} \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kellyâ€™s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem does not specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we first calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both Dijana and Anis rowed together, we add their distances:

\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Pages read yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
     - Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel did not read any pages today, so he read 0 pages.

3. **Total pages read:**
   - Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
   - Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

4. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - The difference is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup:**
   - The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Calculate the amount of soup used for dinner:**
   - Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl.
   - 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.
   - Therefore, 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) are equivalent to 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls.

3. **Calculate the remaining soup after dinner:**
   - The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup.
   - After dinner, the remaining soup is 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls.

4. **Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch:**
   - Calvin has two children.
   - The remaining 4 child bowls of soup can be divided among the two children.
   - Each child will get 4 / 2 = 2 bowls of soup for lunch.

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To calculate the total amount William spent, we need to consider the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he purchased.

1. The cost of one notebook is $1.50.
2. William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
   \[
   5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
   \]
3. The cost of one ballpen is $0.50.
4. William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
   \[
   1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
   \]
5. Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen gives us the total amount William spent:

"To calculate the total amount of material needed for the masks, we need to determine the material required for both the small and large masks separately and then sum them up.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Duncan's current age is 60.
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

We need to find Adam's age in 8 years.

First, let's express the given information in equations:
1. Duncan's age eight years ago: \(60 - 8 = 52\)
2. Adam's age four years ago: \(A - 4\)

According to the problem:
\[52 = 2 \times (A - 4)\]

Now, solve for \(A\):
\[52 = 2A - 8\]
\[52 + 8 = 2A\]
\[60 = 2A\]
\[A = 30\]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find Adam's age in 8 years:
\[A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38\]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Therefore, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this, we get:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the sizes of the two farms together:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total distance driven in a 30-day month. Jon drives 100 miles each day, so over 30 days, the total distance is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since the car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by the interval for tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the profit the class was able to raise from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of berries the sloth must pick up per trip to ensure he collects 24 berries in 8 hours.

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

2. **Determine the number of berries per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect a total of 24 berries.
   - If he makes 2 trips, he must pick up \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle covered and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with wisdom and clarity.

Given:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peterâ€™s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( L \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the problem, we have the following equations:

\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we need to calculate the hay required for the goats and the sheep separately and then sum these amounts.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with the wisdom and clarity He has bestowed upon us.

Given that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points, and Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up the following equations to find out how many points each person scored.

Let:
- \( B \) be the points scored by Bahati,
- \( A \) be the points scored by Azibo,
- \( D \) be the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with wisdom and clarity.

Given:
- Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon.
- Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.
- \( X \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to individual brownies (1 dozen = 12 brownies):

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we need to subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

So, the number of brownies left over is:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sautÃ© 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) flights in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The number of remaining flights is \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem of the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the Combined Howl Duration to Minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve the problem, let's use the information given:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. With 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church received 15 cookies, the number of people in the church can be calculated by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We have a family of 6 people, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon is to be divided such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
- For the 4 kids: \( 4x \)
- For the 2 adults: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, which means she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, which means he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"As Jamaar heads to the store with $10, he plans to buy various fruits. Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Adding these amounts together gives us the total spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late Checkouts:**
   15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon Check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests now in the hotel}
   \]

5. **Evening Check-ins:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests now in the hotel}
   \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- The price of a small stuffed animal, \( S \), is $4.
- The price of a large stuffed animal, \( L \), is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.
- Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
- The total earnings from the sales are $120.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, given that each dwarf uses a steel pickaxe.

1. First, determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day:
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. Next, calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:
   - \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. Finally, determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:
   - \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost. Given the prices for the other packages, we can determine the cost per sandwich and then use that to find the cost for 8 sandwiches.

The first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, which means the cost per sandwich is:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

The second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6, which also means the cost per sandwich is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should be the same, which is $1.5 per sandwich.

Now, to find the cost for 8 sandwiches:
\[ 8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:

"As I walk through the problem, let's break it down step by step, using my understanding of arithmetic and logical reasoning.

Sally initially had:
- 25 red balloons
- 7 green balloons
- 12 yellow balloons

First, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. To find out how many red balloons burst, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally was startled and released half of the yellow balloons. To find out how many yellow balloons she released, we calculate:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving her with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As Sally neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch. To find out how many blue balloons she added, we calculate:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Now, let's sum up all the remaining balloons:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To solve the problem of determining the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop the candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

We are given that three people divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second person took. We need to find the share of the first person.

Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

The second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, so Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes to complete his part. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To determine the savings, we need to compare the cost of buying bananas individually with the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, determine the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, the total amount of fence is 100 feet:
\[ S + H = 100 \]

Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
\[ H = S + 60 \]

Substitute \( H \) in the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining weight after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080

"In the problem, Pierre, Paul, and Jacques together bought 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of the total, and Paul wants a third of the total. We need to determine how many kilograms of apples Jacques will have left.

First, calculate Pierre's share:
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ kg} = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, calculate Paul's share:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \text{ kg} = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, add the shares of Pierre and Paul to find the total amount of apples they have taken:
\[
\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the total amount of apples to find Jacques's share:
\[
\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"To determine how much money Raymond has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial amount of money Raymond had: $21.
2. Add the amount he saved from his allowance: $11.
3. Subtract the amount he spent on a comic book: $5.
4. Subtract the amount he spent on a puzzle: $19.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Initial amount: $21
2. After saving: $21 + $11 = $32

"To determine the cost of each book, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount spent by Anna.
2. Subtract the amount she had already spent from the total amount spent to find out how much she spent on the books.
3. Divide the amount spent on the books by the number of books to find the cost of each book.

Anna's initial budget was $16, and she has $2 left. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

She had already spent $4, so the amount spent on the books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books, the cost of each book is:
\[ 10 \div 2 = 5 \]

Thus, each book cost $5.

"To determine the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives at a speed of 70 miles per hour for 2 hours.
   - Using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \):
   \[
   \text{One-way distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - A round trip involves driving to his parents' house and back.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance is:
   \[
   \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance driven in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Thus, the total monthly distance is:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using logical reasoning and basic arithmetic.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16

"To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the given information. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem provides the ratio of potatoes to scoops: it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - For 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\).

2. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - For the next 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\).

3. Add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days:
   - Total eggs = \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\).

4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of dozens is \(\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}\).

"To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we start by calculating the total number of green and red jellybeans.

1. There are 17 green jellybeans.
2. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans:
   \[
   \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
   \]

Next, we add the number of green and red jellybeans to find the total number of non-blue jellybeans:
\[
\text{Total non-blue jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51
\]

Given that the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:
\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to consider the production for each year from age 5 to age 10, as the tree does not produce any fruit before age 5.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

To find the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using the information given:

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

We can set up the equation for the total length:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the pattern of cloud puffs Alice counts each day.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She counts double the number from Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She counts double the number from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She counts double the number from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She counts double the number from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of puffs counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"In the first half of the soccer match, Team A scores 4 goals, and Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals
- Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is:
6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the teacher's usage of chalk and the conditions for recycling.

1. **Initial Chalk Length:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Usage on Monday:**
   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - Chalk used on Monday: \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday: \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Daily Chalk Usage:**
   - From Tuesday onwards, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - This means 80% of the remaining chalk is left each day.

4. **Calculate Remaining Chalk for Each Subsequent Day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches (remaining after Monday).
   - \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

5. **Determine the Number of Days Before Recycling:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - After 1 day, the remaining chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days, the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using algebraic methods.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow a straightforward calculation process. 

First, we need to find out the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000. Given that 100 books cost $500, we can calculate the cost per book:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing these books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Production:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made per hour - Snowballs melted per hour
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour

4. **Time to Make 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of production.

Let \( x \) be the number of coffee mugs in the teacherâ€™s lounge.

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

First, subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacherâ€™s lounge is \( 8 \).

1. **Determine the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - There are 66 fish in total.
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \).

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish:**
   - Total fish = 66
   - Fish with red stripes = 22
   - Remaining fish = 66 - 22 = 44

3. **Determine the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Fish with red stripes = 22
   - Fish with blue stripes = 20
   - Total fish with red stripes and blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total height of the house.
2. Determine the height of the first floor.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor.

First, we know that Mattison is 60 inches tall. The house is 7 times as high as Mattison:
\[ \text{Total height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, the height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

"In the scenario where twenty tourists discovered 700 shells in a strip mall parking lot, and they divided into three groupsâ€”Alphas, The Finders, and Gogettersâ€”let's determine how many shells each group found.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, who found 40% of the total shells:
\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \text{ shells} \]

Next, we find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas have found their share:
\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \text{ shells} \]

Then, we calculate the number of shells found by team The Finders, who found 60% of the remaining shells:
\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells} \]

Finally, we determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the shells found by the other two teams from the total:
\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \text{ shells} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance the fourth dog needs to walk to maintain the average of 3 miles per day for all four dogs.

First, we calculate the total distance all four dogs should walk together to achieve this average:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Average distance} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we sum the distances walked by the first three dogs:
\[ \text{Distance walked by first three dogs} = 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance the fourth dog needs to walk, we subtract the distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance:
\[ \text{Distance walked by fourth dog} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance walked by first three dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To solve the problem, let's use the information given and set up the relationships step by step.

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
3. Samantha has 27 paintings.

Let's denote:
- The number of paintings Kim has as \( K \),
- The number of paintings Shelley has as \( S \),
- The number of paintings Samantha has as \( M \).

From the problem, we have:
\[ M = S - 12 \]
\[ S = K + 8 \]
\[ M = 27 \]

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72

- The reduced rate is \( 80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \) dollars per hour.
- I have 2 veteran lessons today.
- Therefore, the total earnings from veteran lessons are \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum the earnings from both types of lessons:
- Total earnings = Earnings from standard lessons + Earnings from veteran lessons
- Total earnings = \( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money I will make for the day is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, given that 9 novels represent 3 quarters of that total.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels this year, we need to isolate the variable. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 12 \]

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To solve the problem of how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we will break down the popping process into the intervals given and calculate the number of kernels that pop in each interval.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the following 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is halved compared to the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, so \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels pop.

Now, we sum up all the kernels that popped:

\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim will need, let's break down the requirements step by step.

1. **Lemons for the Pool Party:**
   - Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need \(4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

2. **Lemons for Allen's Extra Gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he will need \(2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}\).

3. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen's extra gallon: 12 lemons
   - Total: \(24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}\)

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought one for himself and 3 friends, so:
\[ 4 \, \text{ice cream cones} \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars/cone} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total money:
\[ 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:
\[ \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}} = 2 \, \text{tickets} \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of producing one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and subtract the total cost to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the cost of making one jar:**
   - Cost of passion fruit: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12\)
   - Cost of jackfruit: \(1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12\)
   - Cost of honey: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20\)

   Total cost for one jar:
   \[
   \$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars:**
   \[
   10 \text{ jars} \times \$44/\text{jar} = \$440
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   \[
   10 \text{ jars} \times \$50/\text{jar} = \$500
   \]

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$500 - \$440 = \$60
   \]

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"To calculate the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to determine the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Number of quarters: 32
   - Value of quarters: \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Number of dimes: 95
   - Value of dimes: \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Number of nickels: 120
   - Value of nickels: \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \) dollars

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Number of pennies: 750
   - Value of pennies: \( 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \) dollars

Adding these values together gives the total dollar amount in the jar:
\[ 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is:

"To calculate how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to consider the number of days he works, the number of cars he services each day, and the payment he receives per car.

1. **Number of working days in a week**: Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. Therefore, he works 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday).

2. **Number of cars serviced per week**: Since he services 3 cars each day, the total number of cars he services in a week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week}
   \]

3. **Weekly earnings**: Josh earns $4 for each car he services. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:
   \[
   15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

4. **Earnings for 2 weeks**: To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
   \[
   60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

"To determine how much money Matthew would earn from selling his toy soldiers, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first half of the collection and the earnings from the second half.

1. Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers.
2. Half of his collection is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers.
3. For the first half (6 toy soldiers), the buyer will pay $5 per toy:
   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. For the second half (6 toy soldiers), the buyer will pay $7 per toy:
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. The total amount Matthew would earn is the sum of the amounts from both halves:
   \[
   30 + 42 = 72 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Matthew would earn $72.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

To find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given and use it to find the number of beakers Igor lost.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg requires 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table needs \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).
5. James has 40 screws in total.

Now, we subtract the number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the distance each person ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed, which is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To calculate the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to break down the costs and the number of reservations per night, and then multiply by the number of days the restaurant is open each week.

Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- 1 bottle of wine at $5.

Thus, the total revenue per reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night, so the total revenue per night is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Radiator:**
   - The original price of the radiator is $400.
   - The discount is 80%, so the discount amount is:

"To solve this problem, let us use a system of equations. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows. We know the following:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + k = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   2c + 4k = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
c + k = 20
\]
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[
(c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
k = 15
\]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
\[
c = 5
\]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
