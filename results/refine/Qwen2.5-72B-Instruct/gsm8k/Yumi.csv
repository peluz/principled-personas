"To calculate the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total investment**: This includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Calculate the new value of the house**: The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value.
   - Original value: $80,000
   - Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit**: Subtract the total investment from the new value of the house.
   - Profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute.
   - Time to download 80 GB: \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Add the time for the Windows restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time so far: \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the time to download the full file again:**
   - The full file size is 200 GB.
   - Time to download 200 GB: \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Total time to download the file:**

"Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the distance John travels away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far he travels back home during the 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

2. **Vacuum Cleaners Sold at the Green House:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

3. **Vacuum Cleaners Remaining After the Green House:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

4. **Vacuum Cleaners Sold at the Red House:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

5. **Vacuum Cleaners Remaining After the Red House:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

6. **Vacuum Cleaners Sold at the Orange House:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

7. **Vacuum Cleaners Remaining After the Orange House:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

8. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

However, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When the remaining 9 liters of orange drink are mixed with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total volume of the mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of silver coins.
- \( G \) as the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \) (total number of coins)
2. \( G = S + 30 \) (30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find the total points he scored, we need to calculate the points for the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points from the first 20 minutes.

1. Points scored in the first 20 minutes: 4 points.
2. Points scored in the second 20 minutes: 25% more than 4 points.

First, calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance for the gold javelin triples. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, her throwing distance becomes:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her enhanced throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

First, we need to determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. According to the nutritional info, each serving has 250 calories, and there are 5 servings in the bag. So, the total number of calories in the bag is:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, we can find the number of grams per calorie:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat for 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Diamonds**: The problem states there are 175 diamonds.
2. **Number of Rubies**: The problem mentions there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Number of Emeralds**: The problem states there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. So, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems in the chest:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 595

"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- The football team played 22 games.
- They won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's denote:
- \( W \) as the number of games won.
- \( L \) as the number of games lost.

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \) (total games played)
2. \( W = L + 8 \) (they won 8 more games than they lost)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

1. Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for the week and isolate Wednesday's viewing.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the total cost of the lumber she originally bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:

"To calculate the total amount Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to consider the number of car washes he gets each month and the cost per car wash. 

1. Tom gets 4 car washes a month.
2. Each car wash costs $15.

First, we calculate the monthly cost:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$60/\text{month} \]

Next, we calculate the yearly cost:
\[ \$60/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$720/\text{year} \]

So, Tom pays \(\boxed{720}\) dollars in a year for car washes."
"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Next, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has after losing 5:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this result to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands:
   \[
   \text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female:
   \[
   \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6.

"Sure, let's break down the cost of Rory's order step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

Next, calculate the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

Then, calculate the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, add these amounts to find the subtotal:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the subtotal:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Add the delivery fee and the tip to the subtotal:
$20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
$29.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many questions Mark completed in each test based on his rate and the time he had.

For the first test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

\[ \text{Questions completed in the first test} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 \, \text{questions} - 40 \, \text{questions} = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

For the second test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

\[ \text{Questions completed in the second test} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 \, \text{questions} - 30 \, \text{questions} = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions left incomplete is the sum of the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 \, \text{questions} + 70 \, \text{questions} = 105 \, \text{questions} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is 700. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Finally, find the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"Sure, let's break down the costs and apply the tax correctly.

John buys the following items:
- Milk: $2 (food)
- Eggs: $3 (food)
- Light bulbs: $3 (nonfood)
- Cups: $3 (nonfood)
- Roach traps: $4 (nonfood)

First, let's calculate the total cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to apply a 10% tax to the nonfood items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the nonfood items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items (including tax):
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home using their respective speeds:
- Steve's speed: 440 feet per minute
- Tim's speed: 264 feet per minute

For Steve:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

   \[
   x - 14
   \]

2. **The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate (7 fries):**
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:**
   \[
   x - 21 - (3 \times 3) = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30

4. **A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. **Ants carried off one fry:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. **Five fries were left:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6

"To determine how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. Therefore, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. Therefore, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Next, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. **Price Increase**: The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.
3. **Number of Increases**: Over 36 months, the price will increase every 2 months. Therefore, the number of increases is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

Each increase is 20% of the original price, so the multiplier for each increase is \( 1 + 0.20 = 1.20 \).

The formula to calculate the final price after multiple increases is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Using a calculator to find \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376 \]

Now, calculate the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let's denote:
- Seth's current age as \( S \)
- Brooke's current age as \( B \)

From the first piece of information, we have:
\[ S = 2B \]

From the second piece of information, in 2 years:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

2. **Determine the total straw used for rabbits:**
   - The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages * \( r \) rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 18r pieces.
   - We know that 18r = 90 pieces.

5. **Solve for \( r \):**
   \[
   18r = 90

3. **Second month collection**: She collects 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. So, she collects \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. **Third month collection**: She collects twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). So, she collects \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's sum up all the cards she has:
- Initial cards: 20
- First month: 60
- Second month: 40
- Third month: 200

Total number of cards: \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\)

"To solve this, let's break down the information:

- Mark edits 1000 sentences in total each week.
- He edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers, so he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.
- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence.

Now, let's calculate the earnings from each publisher:

- Earnings from Publisher A:
  \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

- Earnings from Publisher B:
  \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total weekly earnings:

\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"Hi there! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you solve this chicken egg problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the information given, we can write:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day is:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool, and \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

From the problem, we know:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[ B = 4S \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, let's find Adrian's and Zack's current ages:
- Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.
- Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
- Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.
- Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

"James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards initially. After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the new counts are:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Calculating the percentage:

"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step to find the total amount Mark pays for everything.

1. **Cost of the Cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = \( 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \) dollars.

2. **Tax on the Cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Total tax = \( 10\% \times 240,000 = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \) dollars.

3. **Registration Fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Total registration fees = \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration fees
   - Total cost = \( 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Batch of New Pens**: When these 25 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from 25 empty pens, he can make 5 new pens.
3. **Second Batch of New Pens**: After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens. From these, he can make 1 more new pen.
4. **Final Count**: After using this last pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another full pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the sum of the initial pens, the first batch of new pens, and the second batch of new pens.

25 (initial) + 5 (first batch) + 1 (second batch) = 31

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of letters Mike receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - So, the total number of letters he receives each week is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).

3. **Determine the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Since he responds in kind, he needs to write \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) pages each week.

"Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- There are 4 snails in one aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in another aquarium.
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails:

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Budget} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
   \]

The total price of the house is \$9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to account for the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount he paid off. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Selling Price of the House:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$400,000
   \]

2. **Transfer Fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Loan Amount} = \$250,000
   \]

5. **Total Expenses:**
   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Transfer Fees} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 + \$250,000 = \$282,000
   \]

6. **Net Proceeds:**
   \[
   \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Expenses} = \$400,000 - \$282,000 = \$118,000

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expand and simplify:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To calculate the total amount John pays for the driving service in a year, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Mileage Cost:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Round trip distance: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Miles driven per week: 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
   - Miles driven per year: 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total cost for miles driven: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

2. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - Monthly bonus: $150
   - Total bonus per year: $150 * 12 months = $1,800

3. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $30,000
   - Total bonus: $1,800

"To determine Watson's total earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus he receives if the company performs well.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - Number of weeks in April: \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.29 \) weeks.
   - Total working days in April: \( 4.29 \times 5 = 21.45 \) days.
   - Since he can't work a fraction of a day, we round down to 21 days.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Number of weeks in April: 4 weeks.
   - Total bonus for April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses in one week, we divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks:
   \[
   \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weight loss rate:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we divide the total weight loss by her weekly weight loss rate:
   \[
   \text{Time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Theo has a budget of $6000 for his business trip to South Africa. He plans to buy 6 business suits at $100 each, 3 suitcases at $50 each, and a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Additionally, he wants to save $2000 for the trip. Let's calculate how much he can spend on gifts for his business partners.

First, calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100/\text{suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50/\text{suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Add up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Subtract the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Therefore, Theo has \$2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Total number of players on the football team: 105
- Number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense.
- Number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the number of players on the defense.
- \( 2D \) as the number of players on the offense.
- \( \frac{D}{2} \) as the number of players on the special teams.

The total number of players can be expressed as:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - They earn $1 off for every $20 spent.
   - Rewards earned = \( \frac{80}{20} = 4 \).

2. **Determine the total discount applied on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer used 4 rewards, which means a $4 discount.
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of the rewards off the price.
   - Discount from the coupon = \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
   - Total discount = \( 4 + 8 = 12 \).

3. **Calculate the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $43.
   - Total discount = $12.

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay and by how much, let's break down the calculations for both jobs, considering all the given taxes and deductions.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

**Job B:**

"Let's solve this step by step.

We have a class of 200 students divided into 3 groups. Two of these groups are equal in number, and the third group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students can be expressed as:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[
80 + 80 = 160

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10%, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \).

The equation is:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Simplifying the right side:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5

Next, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark to find the total number of slices they have:
\[
4 \text{ slices} + 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices}
\]

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we add these to the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[
7 \text{ slices} + 2 \text{ slices} = 9 \text{ slices}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[
12 \text{ slices} - 9 \text{ slices} = 3 \text{ slices}
\]

So, the number of slices left is:

"To figure out how many days Mark needs to save to buy the bike, we start by calculating the total amount he still needs. The bike costs $300, and Mark already has $50 in his bank account. So, the amount he still needs is:

\[ \$300 - \$50 = \$250 \]

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can determine the number of days he needs to save by dividing the amount he still needs by his daily earnings:

\[ \frac{\$250}{\$10/\text{day}} = 25 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to buy the bike.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: The number of millipedes is one-third the number of spiders.
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, let's add up all the bugs:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To determine the energy savings, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the original daily energy usage:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - If Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the daily energy usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the usage time:**
   - If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original daily usage and the new daily usage:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

4. **Convert the daily energy savings to kilowatt-hours:**
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, the daily energy savings in kilowatt-hours is:
     \[
     \frac{4500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:**
   - The total energy savings over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Therefore, the total energy savings in 30 days is 135 kilowatt-hours.

"To ensure everyone has a delicious muffaletta sandwich during the big game, let's break down the costs and quantities needed.

1. **Number of Sandwiches Required:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Ingredients Needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

4. **Total Cost:**

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his goal, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. Additionally, he took 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can calculate the total steps he had taken before the jog and then determine how many steps he needed to take to have 2,000 steps left.

Steps taken before the jog:
5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

Total steps needed to reach 10,000:
10,000 - 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps

Steps taken during the jog:
8,000 (total steps needed) - 6,000 (steps before the jog) = 2,000 steps

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

For her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

We are given:
- The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180.
- The total number of humps is 304.
- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"Sure! Let's break down the costs of the items Aleksandra ordered at the restaurant:

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \( 4 / 2 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost: \( 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \) dollars.

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made a total of $150 from selling his Pokémon cards.

Each card is sold for $1.5. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Now, let's solve for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. This means 18 guests (half of 36) would get 2 hot dogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hot dog each.
   - For the 18 guests who get 2 hot dogs each: \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hot dogs.
   - For the 18 guests who get 1 hot dog each: \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hot dogs.
   - Total hot dogs prepared: \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hot dogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs.
   - Total hot dogs needed: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hot dogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short: \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hot dogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

26"

"Sure, let's calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order with the discount applied.

First, we need to find the total cost of the items before the discount:
- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, let's sum up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of spotted puppies.
3. Use the formula for percentage to find the percentage of spotted puppies.

First, let's calculate the total number of puppies:
- Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
- Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, let's calculate the total number of spotted puppies:
- Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies.
- Total number of spotted puppies = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculate the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Convert to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
35%"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, let's break down the total weight of each type of feed and then calculate the total weight. Finally, we'll divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   - **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Sum the weights to find the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans:**
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda each week.
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from cans = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles:**
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water each week.
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from bottles = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

3. **Calculate the total weekly earnings:**
   - Total weekly earnings = Earnings from cans + Earnings from bottles
   - Total weekly earnings = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

4. **Calculate the total earnings for a four-week month:**

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The equation for the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, since the shark's length is given in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

   - Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
   - Total: 9 + 6 = 15

2. Since 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, they have been counted twice in the total of 15. We need to subtract these 3 kids to avoid double-counting:
   - Adjusted total: 15 - 3 = 12

3. Now, we know that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:

"To find the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

5. **Converting the Cost to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:
\[

"To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the order they are stacked. The pyramid is structured as follows:

- **Bottom layer**: 4 girls, each 64 inches tall.
- **Second layer**: 3 girls, each 64 inches tall.
- **Third layer**: 2 girls, each 64 inches tall.
- **Top layer**: 1 girl, 60 inches tall (the shortest girl).

Let's calculate the total height step by step:

1. **Bottom layer**:
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer**:
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer**:
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer**:
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add the heights of all the layers to find the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[
53

First, we need to determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes, and each box contains ten oranges:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges they have together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To determine how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Each pie requires three oranges:

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, let's set up the equations for the total cost at each venue and solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know the following:
1. Lily, David, and Bodhi together collected 43 insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found.
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found.
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. To find out how much yarn they used together, we need to add these fractions.

First, let's convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To figure out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Raisins**: Heather has 27 cups of raisins.
2. **Division of Raisins**: She divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix. So, each category gets:
   \[
   \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]
3. **Raisins per Batch of Cookies**: Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins.
4. **Number of Batches**: To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups, we divide the total cups of raisins for cookies by the amount needed per batch:
   \[
   \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas.
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
- Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.

First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas.
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22
  \]

Next, let's determine the number of chairs Jenna has:
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66
  \]

Now, let's determine the number of sofas Jenna has:
- Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
- Total number of sofas = Number of sofas Ophelia has + Number of sofas Jenna has = 20 + 64 = 84
- Total number of chairs = Number of chairs Ophelia has + Number of chairs Jenna has = 22 + 66 = 88
- Total number of sofas and chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom bought a CD for $4.
2. The total amount Tom spent is $48.
3. To find the cost of the headphone set, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Cost of headphone set} = \$48 - \$4 = \$44
   \]

4. Now, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:
   \[
   \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\$44}{\$4} = 11
   \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here's the breakdown:

1. Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for most of the weeks.
2. He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
3. He spent 6 hours in one week.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks he followed his regular routine:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He spent 5 hours for 2 weeks, and 6 hours for 1 week, which accounts for 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he spent 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.

Now, calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he spent 5 hours each:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, calculate the total hours for the 1 week he spent 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, add all these hours together to get the total:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.
4. The combined cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
5. The remaining amount, which is the cost of the 2 monitors, is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
6. The cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, which is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]

"To figure out how much you need to pay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total dinner bill is $50.
2. Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 bill.
   - 20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.
3. The total amount including the tip is $50 + $10 = $60.
4. Since the check is split evenly, each person would normally pay $50 / 2 = $25.
5. However, you are responsible for the entire tip, so you need to add the $10 tip to your half of the bill.
   - Your total payment is $25 (your half of the bill) + $10 (the tip) = $35.

So, you end up paying $35.

"To meet his monthly saving target of $1125, Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of April compared to the first half. Let's break down the calculations:

1. **Total days in April:** 30 days.
2. **First half of April:** 15 days.
3. **Second half of April:** 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, the total savings in the first half is \( 15x \).

In the second half, Elvis saves twice as much each day, so the amount saved each day is \( 2x \). The total savings in the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know the total savings target is $1125, so:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

So, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars.
- Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). Therefore, Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

"Hello! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you with your question about the pet shop. Let's break it down:

The pet shop has 6 cages of rodents. Out of these, 3 cages contain 10 hamsters each, and the other 3 cages contain 5 guinea pigs each. To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and the number of guinea pigs.

First, let's calculate the total number of hamsters:
3 cages × 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

Next, let's calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
3 cages × 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the two totals together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents.

"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine Susan's weight. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 \]
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate Bob's weight. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:

\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} \]
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the information given and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert this reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \) pages per minute.
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- Shiloh is 44 years old today.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

Let \( N \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

In 7 years:
- Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years.
- His nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \) years.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, let's break down the costs and his earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many hours George needs to work:**
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Let's solve this step by step. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. We are given that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and another angle is three times the smallest angle. Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \).

The angles can be expressed as:
- The smallest angle: \( x \)
- The second angle: \( 2x \)
- The largest angle: \( 3x \)

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we can find the measure of the largest angle:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ 720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two segments and calculate the earnings for each segment before summing them up.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- The total earnings for the first four hours can be calculated as:
  \[
  15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- The total earnings for the next two hours can be calculated as:
  \[
  10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To calculate the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to first understand the total number of washes the bottle can provide under her usage. The bottle is designed to give 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes the bottle can provide is:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Given that the bottle costs $24.00, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost by the total number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to kilobits per hour (kb/h).
2. Convert the speed from kilobits per hour to megabits per hour (Mb/h).

First, let's convert the speed from kb/s to kb/h:
- There are 3600 seconds in one hour (60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour).
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb/s, so in one hour, she can download \( 20 \, \text{kb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \).

Next, let's convert the speed from kb/h to Mb/h:
- Since 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb), we divide the total kilobits by 1000 to get the speed in megabits.
- \( 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \div 1000 = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \).

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To calculate how much James made from selling the used cars, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total sales amount:**
   - James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000.
   - Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

2. **Determine the acquisition cost:**
   - The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
   - Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
   - Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   - James's commission is 10% of the profit.
   - James's commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars per class.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total number of pages in the book is 200.
2. Mike plans to read 10 pages each day.
3. To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]
4. The assignment is due in 30 days. To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish, we subtract the number of days it takes him to read the book from the total number of days available:
   \[
   30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}
   \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase cost and the ongoing monthly expenses for hanger rental and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Fuel Expenses**: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- **Monthly Maintenance Cost**: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- **Annual Maintenance Cost**: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- **Total Cost for the First Year**: $150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (annual maintenance) = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. This means he needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs. After buying the toys, he went back to the shelter and found that there are now twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there are 24 dogs. He then needs to buy 12 more toys to have enough for all 24 dogs. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. 

To summarize:
- Initial toys: 4

First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
\[ M = K + 5 \]
Given \( K = 68 \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, let's find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:

- The age of one twin as \( T \).
- The age of one triplet as \( R \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( T = R + 7 \) (one twin is 7 years older than one triplet)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Rong's monthly savings:**
   Rong saves 20 coins every month.

2. **Determine Neil's monthly savings:**
   Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of months in ten years:**
   \[
   10 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 120 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Calculate Rong's total savings over ten years:**
   \[
   20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
   \]

5. **Calculate Neil's total savings over ten years:**
   \[
   28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
   \]

6. **Calculate the combined total savings:**
   \[
   2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins}
   \]

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"Sure, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To calculate the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.50, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.00, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5.00
- Total cost for apples: $6.00
- Total cost for oranges: $21.00

The total price for the crate is \(5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00\) dollars.

"To solve the problem of finding the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

   - Each adult needs a regular chair.
   - Each baby needs a high chair.

   Total chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of babies
   \[
   42 + 15 = 57
   \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
   \]

   Total chairs currently available = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
   \[
   8 + 40 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Total chairs needed = 57
   - Total chairs currently available = 48

   Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs currently available
   \[
   57 - 48 = 9
   \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"Sure! Let's calculate the total points collected by the students in class 3B and determine how many more points they need to reach the threshold for the trip.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:
\[
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 255 = 145

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's start by converting the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We can set up the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the students' cars and the teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

1. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther had:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas left}
   \]

3. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

So, the final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with:
- 30 small stickers
- 40 large stickers

### Step 1: Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons
Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons:
\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets:
\[ 27 \text{ small buttons} \]

### Step 2: Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons
Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons:
\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets:
\[ 20 \text{ large buttons} \]

### Step 3: Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons
Lorraine has 20 large stickers left:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

### Step 4: Total Number of Buttons
Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:
- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
- Large buttons: 20

Each large button is worth three small buttons, so:
\[ 20 \text{ large buttons} \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Total small buttons:
\[ 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \text{ small buttons} \]

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:
\[ 147 \]

"To solve this problem, let's use a bit of algebra. Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, and \( A \) represent the number of votes against it. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:

\[ F = 2A \]

We also know that the total number of votes is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Now, we can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the second equation:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Since \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three homes is 250.
- The first house needs half the number of cases as the second house.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

From the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases for all three houses is given by:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):**
   - Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
   - One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
   - One friend: 8 quarters

   Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

4. **Calculate the total amount of money spent:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money spent: \(68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this, let's break down the ingredients and their relationships:

- Let the amount of citrus zest be \( z \) ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can set up the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe initially has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars. We subtract the number of cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

"Let's solve this step by step, using the information given:

1. Let \( P \) be the number of cards PJ has.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.
4. The total number of cards is 341.

We can set up the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"In Miss Susan's class, there are 20 students. Out of these, 5 students excel only in math, and 8 students excel only in English. The remaining students are proficient in both subjects. To find out how many students are good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English.

First, let's determine the number of students who are good at both subjects. We know the total number of students is 20, and we subtract the students who are good at English only (8) and those who are good at math only (5):

20 - 8 - 5 = 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students are good at math.

"To figure out how many groups can perform at the concert, let's break down the time allocation for each group and the total concert time.

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Out of this, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the actual time available for performances is:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Each group requires:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes per group} \]

To find out how many groups can perform in the 110 minutes available:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes per group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the principal (P):**
   The principal amount \( P \) is $300.

2. **Determine the interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. This means:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

3. **Identify the time (t):**
   The time period \( t \) is 3 years.

4. **Calculate the simple interest (I):**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   I = 300 \times 675
   \]
   \[
   I = 202500
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount (A):**
   The total amount \( A \) is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   A = 300 + 202500
   \]
   \[
   A = 202800
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{202800}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Floral Shirts:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Number of floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Difference:**
   - Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts with no collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many rooms need to be cleaned. Since we are cleaning one-half of the 90 rooms:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
   \[
   45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the relationships and the total sum of ages.

1. Let my age be \( x \).
2. My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is \( x + 3 \).
3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is \( x - 2 \).
4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"Sure, let's calculate the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received.

First, we determine how much Rafaela received. Each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we calculate how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

"Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.
2. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter. So, the total amount Sarah will receive is:
   \[
   20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
   \]
3. Sarah plans to use this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. The cost of the new rope will be:
   \[
   20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30
   \]
4. The amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope is:
   \[
   \$40 - \$30 = \$10
   \]

So, Sarah will have \(\boxed{10}\) dollars left over."
"To solve the problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Sure, let's break down the costs and calculate how much money Kelly has left in her budget.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.
   - Therefore, each pack of bacon costs:
     \[
     \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Therefore, each packet of chicken costs:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Therefore, each pack of apples costs:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the length of Elaina's usual concerts in minutes.
2. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the concert duration without the encore is \( 2x \).
3. The encore adds 15 minutes to the final concert, making the total duration \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.
4. We know the total duration of the final concert is 65 minutes.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
1. Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 50 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

First, let's add up the toys given away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Now, subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:
200 - 150 = 50 toys

"Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Tuesday, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
2. On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
3. On Friday, they make twice as many chimichangas as they do on Tuesday or Wednesday. Therefore, on Friday, they make \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, let's add up the total number of chimichangas made over these three days:
- Total chimichangas = 125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday)
- Total chimichangas = 500

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many microphones are left without a space to fit in. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

"Sure, let's calculate the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids.

First, we need to find the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, we calculate the total number of petals for the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals:
- Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
- Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

"To figure out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, let's break it down step by step.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- This means each small mask requires \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the total material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- This means each large mask requires \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the total material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

"To solve this problem, let's break down the expenses and then determine the amount of allowance each girl received.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin.
3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Breaking it down step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( L \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the given information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, let's break down the requirements for both the goats and the sheep.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Swimming Distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Time for Initial Swimming:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Rest Time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Remaining Distance:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Speed for Remaining Distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Time for Remaining Swimming:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns from selling newspapers, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the commission from the New York Times and the commission from the Wall Street Journal.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies.
   - Total commission from New York Times = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 10 copies.
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal = \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
   - Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
15.00"
"To solve this, let's start by figuring out Marcus's age. We know Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna. So, Marcus's age is:

\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \]

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- The total points scored by the team is 45.
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the points scored by Bahati.
- \( A \) as the points scored by Azibo.
- \( D \) as the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To solve this, we need to understand the relationship between the thickness of the book and the number of pages. Given that the book is printed on paper with 100 pages per inch and each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, we can calculate the total number of pages.

The book is 1.5 inches thick. Since there are 100 pages per inch, we can find the total number of pages by multiplying the thickness by the number of pages per inch:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

Therefore, the book has 150 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupied Beds:**
   The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are initially occupied.
   \[
   \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
   \]

2. **Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks:**
   The hospital admits 50 patients each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700
   \]

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   Adding the initial occupied beds to the patients admitted over 2 weeks gives us the total number of occupied beds:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900
   \]

4. **Unoccupied Beds:**

Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now, since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can determine his age:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon.
- Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.
- \( X \) as the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age in 5 years:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be \(19 + 5 = 24\) years old.

2. **Determine Emil's dad's age in 5 years:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, Emil's dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

3. **Determine Emil's dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

4. **Determine Emil's brother's age in 5 years:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Therefore, Emil's brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

5. **Determine Emil's brother's current age:**
   - Since Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now:**
   - Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.
   - Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. To find the number of football players, we calculate 20% of 30:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

This leaves us with:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find this number, we calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ cheerleaders or band members} \]

Adding the football players and the cheerleaders or band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

"To figure out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
  \[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
  \[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. We subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To determine how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly savings for shoes:
   - Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.
   - She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
   - Monthly savings for shoes = 25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

2. Calculate the annual savings for shoes:
   - Monthly savings = $500.00
   - Annual savings = $500.00 * 12 months = $6,000.00

3. Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: peeling the shrimp and cooking the shrimp.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) flights in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The number of remaining flights is \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**

"To solve the problem, let's break down the howl durations for each of the three little wolves:

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's use the information given:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We have a family of 6 people, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon is to be divided such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
- For the 4 kids: \( 4x \)
- For the 2 adults: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is \( 9 + 5 = 14 \).
3. **Yellow Sticks**: There are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

Now, let's add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks:
\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Matteo's time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Shandy's time: 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
- Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   - The car costs $10,000.
   - Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   - Janet makes $10 an hour from wages.
   - She also makes $15 an hour from tips.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. The prices are as follows:
- Peaches and pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

- Cost of peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Cost of pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Cost of kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Cost of apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total amount spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. Anne had 15 packs and kept 2 for herself, so she gave away:

\[ 15 - 2 = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces in the 13 packs. Each pack contains 60 pieces, so:

\[ 13 \times 60 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Let's solve this step by step. 

First, we know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Next, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - He needs to move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

3. **Total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he doesn't need additional time to drop the candy in the first bottle.
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:
- Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set.
- Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
- First set: \( x + 4 \)
- Second set: \( x \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} \)

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To figure out how much Dennis will spend on butter, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - Therefore, he needs \( 6 \) pounds of butter.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every pound of butter purchased at full price, the next pound is half price.

3. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - For the first pound, the cost is \( \$4.00 \).
   - For the second pound, the cost is \( \$4.00 \times 0.5 = \$2.00 \).
   - For the third pound, the cost is \( \$4.00 \).
   - For the fourth pound, the cost is \( \$4.00 \times 0.5 = \$2.00 \).
   - For the fifth pound, the cost is \( \$4.00 \).
   - For the sixth pound, the cost is \( \$4.00 \times 0.5 = \$2.00 \).

4. **Sum the costs:**
   - Total cost = \( \$4.00 + \$2.00 + \$4.00 + \$2.00 + \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$18.00 \).

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

"Sure! Let's calculate the total cost for Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater.

First, we need to determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:
- 25 classmates
- 7 girls from her dance class
- 13 family members

Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we account for the 4 people who said they could not come:
Total guests attending = 45 - 4 = 41

The theater has a base fee of $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the initial 20, there is an additional fee of $6.

Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126

Now, we add the base fee to the cost for the additional guests:
Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost for the party is:

"To figure out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}

"To find the number of girls in the school, we start by understanding that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. This means that 40% of the total student population equals 240 boys.

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To figure out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how much Jane has already saved:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks she needs to save $28:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without any discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem also states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Next, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the relationships between the lengths of the ropes.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]

6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]

7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]

8. Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
   \[
   4B = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Money Left with Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie originally had $5.
   - After giving $3 to his little sister, Ronnie is left with:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we'll expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

"To figure out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, let's break down the process:

1. **Snowball Production Rate:**
   - Jay can build 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Snowball Melting Rate:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Snowball Production:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs built - Snowballs melted
   - Net snowballs made per hour = \(20 - 8 = 12\)

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net production rate.
   - Time required = \(\frac{60}{12} = 5\) hours

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and determine the initial number of bandages.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we calculate the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Then, we find the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount John spends on everything:

"To calculate the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, let's break down the information:

- On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(20 \times 2 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total for the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than the 40 he planted on the first day. This means he planted an additional \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\) Lodgepole Pine trees, making the total for the second day \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's sum up the totals:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Adding these together gives the total number of trees planted:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost and Visits:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - For the first 5 years, the total cost is calculated as:
     \[
     3 \text{ visits/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/visit} \times 5 \text{ years} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Price Increase:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is:
     \[
     1.5 \times 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The new cost of one visit is:
     \[
     2 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost After Price Increase:**
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for the next 3 years.
   - The total cost for these 3 years is:
     \[
     3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} \times 3 \text{ years} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   - The total amount spent on all visits is the sum of the costs before and after the price increase:
     \[
     30 \text{ dollars} + 45 \text{ dollars} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To figure out how much of my secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need for 80 meatballs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef are required to make 80 meatballs. Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef, we can calculate the number of pounds needed as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the total amount of seasoning needed is:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Sure! Let's break down the costs for Karen's salon visit.

First, the basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. Since the salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services, we need to calculate the total cost before the discount:

\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the discount amount is $15. Subtracting this from the total cost gives us:

\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Now, Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers, and the cost per nail is $3. Therefore, the total cost for the nail art is:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:

\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ 90 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. This means:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 12
   \]
   Substituting the number of Samantha's paintings:
   \[
   27 = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 12
   \]
   Solving for Shelley's paintings:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]

3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. This means:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Kim's paintings} + 8
   \]
   Substituting the number of Shelley's paintings:
   \[
   39 = \text{Kim's paintings} + 8
   \]
   Solving for Kim's paintings:
   \[
   \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - So, the price in December was $72.

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36

"To calculate Charlie's total earnings for the day, we need to consider the different rates he charges for his lessons. For standard lessons, he charges $80 per hour, and for lessons with veterans, he offers a 25% discount, making the rate $60 per hour.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 standard lessons, each lasting 1 hour.
- Earnings from standard lessons = 4 hours * $80/hour = $320.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the veteran lessons:
- Charlie has 2 veteran lessons, each lasting 1 hour.
- The discounted rate for veterans is $80 * (1 - 0.25) = $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour.
- Earnings from veteran lessons = 2 hours * $60/hour = $120.

Now, we sum the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total earnings for the day:
- Total earnings = Earnings from standard lessons + Earnings from veteran lessons
- Total earnings = $320 + $120 = $440.

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples} \]

He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples} \]

This leaves him with:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples} \]

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each, so the total amount of money he received is:

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes in total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is given by:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is 116, so we have:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

"Sure, let's break down the time it takes for John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To help Phineas Frog return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to travel 200 yards, with half the distance on land and the other half in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
3. **Distance in Water**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time for each segment:

- **Time on Land**:
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**:
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Adding these times together gives us the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]

   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step.

First, the cost of the new radiator is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount amount:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the price Mark pays for the radiator is:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, the mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

230"
"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows. We know the following:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[ c + k = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices:

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Next, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes 4 people in total:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
