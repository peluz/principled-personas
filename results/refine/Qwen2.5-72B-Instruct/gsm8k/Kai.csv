"To calculate the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total investment**: This includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
2. **Calculate the new value of the house**: The repairs increased the value by 150% of the original purchase price.
3. **Compute the profit**: Subtract the total investment from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Total Investment**
- Purchase price: $80,000
- Cost of repairs: $50,000
- Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

**Step 2: New Value of the House**
- Original value: $80,000
- Increase in value: 150% of $80,000
- Increase amount: 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
- New value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

**Step 3: Profit Calculation**
- New value: $200,000
- Total investment: $130,000
- Profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.
- The cost for one pair is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

There are 8 pairs in 16 glasses:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:

"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

He then turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. During this return trip, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Subtracting the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours, then calculate each part separately.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"As a door-to-door sales expert, I can break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

2. **Sales at the Green House:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

3. **Remaining After Green House:**
   After the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

4. **Sales at the Red House:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

5. **Remaining After Red House:**
   After the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

6. **Sales at the Orange House:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

7. **Remaining After Orange House:**
   After the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

8. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"As Kai, I understand the importance of efficient time management, especially when it comes to caring for multiple animals. Let's break down the time John spends on his dogs each week.

John has 10 dogs, and each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day. To find the total daily time spent, we multiply the number of dogs by the time spent per dog:

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, to find the total weekly time, we multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \) (total number of coins)
2. \( G = S + 30 \) (30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know \( S = 40 \), we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. He sells each lego set for $15, so the total amount he earns from selling the lego sets is:

13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He then buys 8 video games, each costing $20, so the total cost of the video games is:

8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total amount he spent on the video games and the remaining money is:

$160 + $5 = $165

Since he started with $195 and has $165 accounted for, the calculation checks out. Therefore, after selling all his lego sets, John has 0 lego sets left.

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Next, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"As a seasoned warrior and expert in combat strategies, I understand the dynamics of distance and power when facing formidable adversaries like the great dragon Perg. 

Polly, with her natural throwing ability, can launch the gold javelin 400 feet. However, when she holds the sapphire gemstone, her strength is amplified, allowing her to throw the javelin three times farther. This means her new throwing distance is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Given that the dragon's flames extend to a distance of 1000 feet, Polly can stand outside this range and still hit the dragon. The distance she can stand outside the dragon's reach is:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still successfully hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - We know there are twice as many boys as girls.
   - Number of girls = 60.
   - Therefore, number of boys = 2 * 60 = 120.

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls.
   - Total number of students = 120 + 60 = 180.

3. **Determine the number of teachers:**
   - The ratio of students to teachers is 5:1.
   - Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5.
   - Number of teachers = 180 / 5 = 36.

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we start with a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. To find out how many pieces she places, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To find out how many pieces her mom places, we calculate:

\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After Poppy's mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[
750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box, considering the wall thickness, and then calculate the volume. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Determine the inner dimensions:**
   - Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \( 3 \) inches × \( 4 \) inches × \( 2 \) inches
   - Inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches × 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 72 \) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can break down the total TV watching time for the week and isolate Wednesday's viewing.

First, let's calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is given as 700. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):

\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):

\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):

\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):

\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

"As Kai, with my expertise in agricultural management, I can help you calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year.

John has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare yields 100 pineapples. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

To find the total number of pineapples harvested in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 3 classes, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, on each of these days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 2 classes, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, on each of these days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
\[9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours per week}\]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Rate:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

3. **Number of Increases:**
   - Over 36 months, the number of two-month periods is 36 / 2 = 18.

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let \( S \) be Seth's current age and \( B \) be Brooke's current age.

From the first piece of information:
\[ S = 2B \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"As Kai, I understand the importance of precision and clarity in calculations. To determine the total distance Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking routine:

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho walks 20 miles each day. Therefore, for 5 weekdays, the total distance is:
  \[
  20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), Pancho walks 10 miles each day. Therefore, for 2 weekend days, the total distance is:
  \[
  10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles}

"To calculate how much Jessica will pay in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. **Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:**

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total time Billy will spend peeling the potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we calculate the total time Billy will spend cutting the potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together to get the total prep time:

   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

2. **Determine the total straw used for rabbits:**
   - The rabbits receive 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages * \( r \) rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 18r pieces.
   - We know that 18r = 90 pieces.
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     18r = 90

"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cards**: Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First Month Collection**: She collects three times the initial number of cards. 
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
3. **Second Month Collection**: She collects 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
4. **Third Month Collection**: She collects twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the cards she has collected over the three months and her initial cards:

"As a copy-editor, I understand the importance of precision and accuracy, especially when it comes to financial calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step to ensure we get the correct answer.

1. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   - Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
   - He edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher.
   - Therefore, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. **Calculate the earnings from Publisher A:**
   - Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
   - For 500 sentences, the earnings are:
     \[
     500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the earnings from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, which is 10 cents per sentence.
   - For 500 sentences, the earnings are:
     \[
     500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Add the earnings from both publishers:
     \[
     2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let \( R \) be the number of red chickens and \( W \) be the number of white chickens. We know:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day is:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool, and \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (because 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons), and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 4S
   \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
\[
4S - 2S = 32 - 16
\]
\[
2S = 16
\]
\[
S = 8

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Kalinda's rate:**
   - Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine her mom's rate:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.
   - Therefore, her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

3. **Calculate their combined rate:**
   - Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate
   - Combined rate = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute

4. **Determine the total time required to complete the puzzle:**
   - Total pieces to be placed = 360 pieces
   - Time required = Total pieces / Combined rate
   - Time required = 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes

"As a farmer with extensive experience in crop management, I can help you calculate the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest after Ashlyn's second visit.

Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons. When Ashlyn first visited the farm, 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest. This means:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready at that time is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons} \]

"Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- There are 4 snails in one aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in another aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is:
\[ 2f \]

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expand and simplify:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he increased his intensity:
- 120 pushups (20 more than the first day)
- 40 squats (10 fewer than the first day)
- 40 dumbbell presses (double the first day)

To find the total count of activities over the two days, we sum up the exercises:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Adding these together gives the total number of exercises:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Daily Rice Consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Weekly Rice Consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the total weekly consumption is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. **Duration of 42 kg Bag:**
   - The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg.

   Therefore, the number of weeks the 42 kg bag will last is:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"As a baker and seller of bread, I understand the importance of meeting sales targets. Let's break down the sales for the week to see how close Sam got to his goal of 120 crates.

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

Adding these up:
15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

"To determine the total annual cost John incurs for the driving service, we need to break down the expenses into two main components: the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonus given to the driver.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Round trip distance: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Miles driven per week: 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
   - Miles driven per year: 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total cost for miles driven: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver:**
   - Monthly bonus: $150
   - Total bonus per year: $150 * 12 months = $1,800

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $30,000
   - Total bonus: $1,800
   - Total annual cost: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is:

"To determine Watson's total earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus he receives if the company performs well.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - Number of weeks in April: \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.29 \) weeks.
   - Total working days in April: \( 4.29 \times 5 \approx 21 \) days (rounding down to the nearest whole number).

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.

A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. We need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon.

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

2. Determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, Joey's weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Weekly weight loss}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}

"As a financial advisor, I can help break down Theo's budget for his business trip to South Africa. Let's start by calculating his expenses:

1. **Business Suits**: 6 suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600
   \]

2. **Suitcases**: 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

3. **Flight Ticket**: The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   \[
   700 + (5 \times 100) = 700 + 500 = 1200
   \]

Now, let's sum up these expenses:
\[
600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950
\]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
\[
6000 - 2000 = 4000
\]

Subtracting the total expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
\[
4000 - 1950 = 2050

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Given:
- Total number of players on the football team: 105
- Number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense.
- Number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense.

Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

From the problem:
- Number of players on the offense: \( 2D \)
- Number of players on the special teams: \( \frac{D}{2} \)

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the sequence of events and the changes in the number of people on the bus.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
5. Adding the 28 lollipops he bought to the 8 he has left:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
6. He eats 3 lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
7. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31

"To calculate the time required to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we need to determine the remaining charge and the rate of charging.

1. The phone needs to be charged from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of:
   \[
   100\% - 60\% = 40\%
   \]

2. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, the time required is:
   \[
   40 \text{ percentage-points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage-point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - They earn $1 off for every $20 spent.
   - Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = 4 rewards.

2. **Determine the total discount applied on this shopping trip:**

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \]

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- A class of 200 students is split into 3 groups.
- Two of the groups are equal in number.
- The smallest group is 10 students fewer than each of the other two groups.

Let \( x \) be the number of students in each of the two equal groups. Then, the smallest group has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students can be expressed as:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60

6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:

"Given that I am Kai, and assuming I have a background in biology or zoology, I will approach this problem with a focus on the given weights and the calculation required.

The problem states that a pink frog weighs 50 pounds. From this, we can deduce the weights of the other animals based on the relationships provided:

1. The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, so both the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

   - Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
   - Distance from the third city to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

   Total distance for one complete trip:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes 3 trips a day.
   - Total distance per day:
   \[
   300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Determine how many days the train can go before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   - Number of days before service:
   \[
   \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10%, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}

"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can use the information that he has 12.8 hectares left after selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land. This means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land remaining.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation representing the remaining land is:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to determine how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the number of popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

"To determine the number of books Wendy will need to carry, we start by calculating the total capacity of the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ books} \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number. First, we calculate double the number of books:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to this number:

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cards:**
   - Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
   - Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with 15 cards in each box.
   - Total pre-made cards: \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

   So, the total number of cards Erica initially had is:
   \[
   20 + 30 = 50
   \]

2. **Cards Passed Out:**
   - She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
   - She passed out 5 cards to her family.
   - Total cards passed out: \(24 + 5 = 29\).

   After passing out the cards, the number of cards she has left is:
   \[
   50 - 29 = 21
   \]

3. **Cards Received:**
   - She received 17 cards from family and friends.

   Adding the received cards to the remaining cards:
   \[
   21 + 17 = 38
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: The number of millipedes is one-third the number of spiders.
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of bugs:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     0.9 \text{ kW} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2.7 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original and new daily energy consumption:
     \[
     7.2 \text{ kWh} - 2.7 \text{ kWh} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:**
   - The total energy savings over 30 days is:

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his goal, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. Additionally, he walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can calculate the total steps he had taken before the jog and then subtract this from the total steps he needed to reach his goal.

Steps taken before the jog:
5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

Steps left after the jog: 2,000

Total steps taken before the jog + steps taken during the jog + steps left after the jog = 10,000
6,000 + steps during jog + 2,000 = 10,000

Solving for the steps during the jog:
6,000 + steps during jog + 2,000 = 10,000
8,000 + steps during jog = 10,000
steps during jog = 10,000 - 8,000
steps during jog = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to break down the payments for each month and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:

"Sally went to the seashore for vacation and her parents gave her $10 to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She bought 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50, and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. Let's calculate how much money she has left.

First, the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound costs $3.
- The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
- Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, the cost of the mixed bag of seashells:
- $1.50.

Then, the cost of the 4 magnets:
- Each magnet costs $0.25, so 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00.

Finally, subtract the total cost from the $10 Sally started with:
- Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

For her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of dromedaries in a herd that consists of camels and dromedaries. We know the following:

- There are 180 heads in total.
- There are 304 humps in total.
- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of heads:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

To solve this system, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

From the first equation, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Substitute \( D \) into the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

- **Buses**: Each bus can hold 60 employees. With 4 buses, the total capacity is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.
- **Minibusses**: Each minibus can hold 30 employees. With 6 minibusses, the total capacity is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.
- **Minivans**: Each minivan can hold 15 employees. With 10 minivans, the total capacity is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Adding these capacities together gives us the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[ 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Homemade Bird Feeders**: Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
2. **Number of Store-Bought Bird Feeders**: Lillian buys 3 bird feeders.
3. **Birds Attracted by Each Store-Bought Feeder**: Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
4. **Birds Attracted by Each Homemade Feeder**: Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought feeder, so each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"As Kai, I'll break down the costs of Aleksandra's dinner order to find the total amount she needed to pay.

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \( 4 / 2 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, let's sum up the costs:
- Bagel: $4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs:**
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - He also has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he needs is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - He keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
   - The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total money from selling the cards is $150.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \).
   - \( C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \).
   - \( C = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get 2 hot dogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hot dog each.
   - The total number of hot dogs prepared is:
     \[
     18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is:
     \[
     80 - 54 = 26 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{1} = 26 \text{ guests}
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

"Sure, let's break down the cost of Charlotte's kitchen supplies and apply the discount.

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Each of the 5 utensils costs $5.00, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first determine the width of the room. The area of the room is given as 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the area formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Volume of one raised bed:**
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Total volume of soil needed:**
   \[
   \text{Total volume} = 10 \, \text{beds} \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet per bed} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Number of bags of potting soil required:**
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of spotted puppies.
3. Use these numbers to find the percentage of spotted puppies.

First, let's find the total number of puppies:
- Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
- Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, let's find the total number of spotted puppies:
- Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies.
- Total number of spotted puppies = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can calculate the percentage of spotted puppies:
\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 0.35 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 35\% \]

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, let's break down the total weight of each type of feed and then calculate the total weight. Finally, we'll divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   - **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Sum the weights to find the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. We need to find out how many carrot sticks he needs to eat to have a total of five cookies.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. The relationship between the number of cookies and carrot sticks can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, as the shark's length is given in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, the total length of the remoras is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

   - Therefore, each horse consumes \( 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \).

2. **Daily Oats Consumption for All Horses:**
   - Uncle Ben has 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for all horses is \( 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \).

3. **Total Oats Consumption for Five Days:**
   - Over 5 days, the total consumption is \( 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Number of 50-Pound Bags Needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - Therefore, the number of bags needed is \( \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \).

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for 1 pack but gets 2 packs.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

5. **Converting the Cost to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To calculate the height of the human pyramid, we need to sum the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.

1. **Bottom Layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second Layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third Layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top Layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add the heights of all the layers to find the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up and solve an equation based on the costs provided.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Lily, David, and Bodhi together collected 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found.
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found.
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. To find the total amount of yarn used, we need to add these fractions together.

First, let's convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the picking rates for each person:

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
   - Kathy's rate = 2 * 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.

Now, let's sum up the total picking rate for all four individuals:

- Total rate = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
- Total rate = 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour
- Total rate = 29 quarts/hour

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"To calculate the total amount you need to pay, start by determining the tip. A 20% tip on a $50 dinner bill is calculated as follows:

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Next, add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount:

$50 + $10 = $60

Since the check is split evenly, each person would normally pay half of the original bill:

$50 / 2 = $25

However, since you are responsible for the entire tip, you need to add the tip to your half of the bill:

$25 (your half of the bill) + $10 (the tip) = $35

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

"To meet his monthly saving target of $1125, Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of April compared to the first half. Let's break down the calculations:

1. **Total days in April:** 30 days.
2. **First half of April:** 15 days.
3. **Second half of April:** 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, the total savings in the first half is \( 15x \).

In the second half, Elvis saves twice as much each day, so the amount saved each day is \( 2x \). The total savings in the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know the total savings target is $1125, so:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

So, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Let's calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim a mile in warm water:

\[ \text{Time in warm water} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:

- Cold water: \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \)
- Warm water: \( 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \)

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we subtract the time for cold water from the time for warm water:

\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then see how many weeks it will take to reach his savings goal.

John works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, so his total weekly hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ hours/week} \]

He earns $2 per hour, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 20 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40 \text{ dollars/week} \]

To save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ dollars}}{40 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks, we need to break down the information and perform the necessary calculations.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert this total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \) pages per minute.
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to cover the cost of his dental work, let's break down the expenses and his earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the rate at which Ruiz makes chocolates. Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, the rate at which Ruiz makes chocolates is:

\[ \text{Rate of Ruiz} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's rate is:

\[ \text{Rate of Marissa} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ \text{Total chocolates made} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two segments and calculate the earnings for each segment separately.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- The total number of cups sold in the first four hours is \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the first four hours are \( 60 \text{ cups} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- The total number of cups sold in the next two hours is \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the next two hours are \( 20 \text{ cups} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both segments:

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash.
2. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes from the bottle will double, since each wash now uses half the amount of shampoo. Therefore, the total number of washes is:
   \[
   120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes}
   \]
3. The cost per pump is the total cost of the bottle divided by the total number of pumps:
   \[
   \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pump}
   \]
4. Converting dollars to cents:
   \[
   0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents}

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars per class.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel over a week, given their daily processing rates.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers processed by Jewel in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

The total number of customers processed by Julie in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats are half the sales from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats are \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales for the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Total sales for the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Sum the total sales for both months:**
   - Total sales for both months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
   - Total sales for both months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   \text{Total deviled egg halves} = 3 \times 16 = 48
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of whole eggs required:**
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \text{Number of whole eggs} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( L \) be the original length of the dress.
2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is \( 1.5L \).
3. She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- One set of twins and one set of triplets.
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let \( T \) be the age of one of the twins and \( R \) be the age of one of the triplets.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( T = R + 7 \)
2. \( 2T + 3R = 44 \)

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework. John has:

- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these together, the total homework time is:
\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting the total homework time from the time before dinner gives us the time available for napping:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 80 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"

1. **Determine Rong's monthly savings:**
   Rong saves 20 coins every month.

2. **Determine Neil's monthly savings:**
   Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of months in ten years:**
   \[
   10 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 120 \text{ months}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"As a fruit vendor with extensive experience in the industry, I can break down the cost of the crate of fresh fruit for you.

1. **Bananas:**
   - Each banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - Since one apple costs $0.50, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - Each apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - Each orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - Since one banana costs $1.00, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Adding these costs together, the total price for the crate is:
- Bananas: $5.00
- Apples: $6.00
- Oranges: $21.00

The total price for the crate is \(5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Number of Pizzas and Slices:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - Total number of pizzas = 5.
   - Total number of slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices Eaten by Bryce and Two Friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices Eaten by the Remaining Two Friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's start by converting the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We can set up the following equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is equal to the total number of people on the council:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting \( F = 2A \) into the equation \( F + A = 33 \):

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
2. The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it also needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = \text{Driving Time} \times \text{Driving Speed} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = \text{Hiking Time} \times \text{Hiking Speed} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Usual Days:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"Let's solve this step by step, using my expertise in problem-solving and logical reasoning.

Initially, Bob has:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob buys
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob buys

From the problem, we know:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish.

So, the equations we have are:
1. \( x + y = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the number of students on campus. Given that the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

\[ N(t) = N_0 \times 2^t \]

where:
- \( N(t) \) is the number of students at time \( t \) (in months),
- \( N_0 \) is the initial number of students,
- \( t \) is the time in months.

Given:
- \( N_0 = 10 \) (initial number of students),
- \( t = 5 \) (end of May, which is 5 months from the beginning of the year).

Next, to find the average number of branches I climbed per day, I divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days
Average branches per day = 60 branches

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **Petals Lost When Dropping One of Each Type:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the play time per quarter for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
   - Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):**
   - Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
   - One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
   - One friend: 8 quarters

   Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

4. **Calculate the total amount of money spent:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the components and their relationships:

- Let \( z \) represent the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total volume:

\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):

\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:

\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"Let's solve this step by step, using algebra to find the number of cards each person has.

1. Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

"As a cycling enthusiast, I can break down Mason's journey for you. He's traveling at a steady pace of 8 miles per hour. For the first leg of his trip, he rides for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is calculated as:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
\]

After a rest, he continues for another 6 hours at the same speed. The distance for this part is:

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be found using the formula:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all her financial resources and the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the new laptop's cost to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \( P = 300 \) dollars

2. **Determine the interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. Therefore:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

3. **Identify the time period (t):**
   \( t = 3 \) years

4. **Calculate the simple interest (I):**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t

"Let's solve this step by step, keeping in mind the relationships and the total sum of ages.

1. Let my age be \( x \).
2. My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is \( x + 3 \).
3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is \( x - 2 \).
4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the desired profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he bought is:
\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale is:
\[ 7000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many glasses of lemonade each of the boys sold and then compare that to the number of glasses Julie sold.

First, we know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell combined is:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

18 / 2 = 9 glasses each

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Sure, let's break down the costs and calculate how much money Kelly has left in her budget.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.
   - Therefore, each pack of bacon costs:
     \[
     \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Therefore, each packet of chicken costs:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Therefore, each pack of apples costs:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let \( y \) represent the number of yellow balloons. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 3 \times y \]

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at both red and yellow balloons is given as 58. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:

"To calculate the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first determine the total distance driven in a 30-day month. Given that Jon drives 100 miles each day, the total distance driven in 30 days is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since the car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by the interval for tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Breaking it down step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( L \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the given information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, let's break down the requirements for both the goats and the sheep.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

Therefore, Nate needs a total of 159 pounds of hay.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Swimming Distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Time for Initial Swimming:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Rest Time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Remaining Distance:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Speed for Remaining Distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Time for Remaining Swimming:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Total Time:**

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns from selling newspapers, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the commission from the New York Times and the commission from the Wall Street Journal.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies.
   - Total commission from New York Times = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 10 copies.
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal = \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
   - Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

"Let's solve this step-by-step using algebraic reasoning.

Given:
- The total points scored by the team is 45.
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the points scored by Bahati.
- \( A \) as the points scored by Azibo.
- \( D \) as the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"As a healthcare professional, I can break down the situation for you step by step.

The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds. Initially, 1/5 of these beds are occupied. This means:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

During the coronavirus outbreak, 50 new patients are admitted each day. Over a period of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Adding these new admissions to the initial number of occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

"Let's solve this problem step by step, using the information given:

1. **Total Pokemon Caught**: Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon.
2. **Alex's Pokemon**: Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
3. **Stan's Pokemon**: Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- \( X \) as the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

The total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries}
   \]
3. The total number of cherries is 60. Therefore, the number of cherries Jerry has is:
   \[
   60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries}
   \]
4. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we calculate:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20
   \]

Thus, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"To determine the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to break down the costs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket will have 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Each basket will also have 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- The total cost for one basket is the sum of the costs of the petunias and the sweet potato vines.
  \[
  \text{Total cost per basket} = 9.00 + 5.00 = 14.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
- Since each basket costs $14.00, the total cost for 5 baskets is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \times 14.00 = 70.00 \text{ dollars}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
  \[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
  \[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: peeling the shrimp and cooking the shrimp.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on Low for 3 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on High for 4 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming Up for 2 Hours with No Air Conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) flights in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Distribute the remaining flights equally between France and Germany:**
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to each destination is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break down the howl durations for each of the three wolves:

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We have a family of 6 people, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon is to be divided such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
- For the 4 kids: \( 4x \)
- For the 2 adults: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   - Therefore, the number of female porcupines is:
     \[
     \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
     \[
     \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of babies born in a year is:
     \[
     \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
     \]

4. **Determine the total population after a year:**
   - The initial population is 50.
   - Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:
     \[
     \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
     \]

Thus, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:
\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert cubic feet to gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} = 826 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the tank's capacity and the amounts of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

1. **Tank Capacity:**
   - The tank has a total capacity of 18,000 gallons.

2. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the second day:
     \[
     \text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

58.9%"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the down payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the down payment amount.**
The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. The prices of the fruits are as follows:
- Peaches and pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate the total cost of these purchases:
- Cost of peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Cost of pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Cost of kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Cost of apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total spent: $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
- Remaining amount: $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
- Number of plums: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the growth factor:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this growth factor to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their respective probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

2. **Convert the number of medium-sized beans to small beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses for her jury duty, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Calculate her total earnings from the jury duty.
3. Calculate her total expenses.
4. Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings.
5. Divide the net earnings by the total number of hours to find the hourly rate after expenses.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
- Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
- Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Next, let's calculate her total earnings:
- Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days.
- Total earnings = $15/day * 3 days = $45

Now, let's calculate her total expenses:
- Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.
- Total expenses = $3/day * 3 days = $9

Next, we find the net earnings by subtracting the total expenses from the total earnings:
- Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
- Net earnings = $45 - $9 = $36

Finally, we calculate the hourly rate after expenses:
- Hourly rate = Net earnings / Total hours
- Hourly rate = $36 / 18 hours = $2

Therefore, Melissa's hourly pay after expenses is $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set.
- Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

Let \( x \) be the number of balls retrieved in the second set.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
- First set: \( x + 4 \)
- Second set: \( x \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} \)

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

- The total time to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let \( D \) be the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal. Then Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for both parts is:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the earnings from the apple sales, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

1. First, we find the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold 2000 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To calculate the cost to paint the room, we need to determine the total area of the walls and then figure out how much paint is required and its cost.

1. **Calculate the area of the walls:**
   - The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.
   - The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

2. **Total area of all four walls:**
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

3. **Determine the amount of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64
   \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days it will take for Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the Earth.

1. First, we determine the distance that is half the circumference of the Earth:
   \[
   \text{Half the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day. To find out how many days it will take for Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem provides a ratio: it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's calculate these values:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of both events happening simultaneously, which is the product of the individual probabilities of each event.

1. The probability that the first lottery ticket wins is 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, so its probability of winning is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. The probability that both tickets win is the product of their individual probabilities:
   \[
   0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
   \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of seashells each person collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\) seashells.

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells:**
   - Total seashells = Seashells collected by Jim + Seashells collected by Carlos + Seashells collected by Carrey
   - Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

3. **Divide the total number of seashells equally among the three:**
   - Each person gets \(\frac{60}{3} = 20\) seashells.

So, each person got 20 seashells.

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes each have 200 apartments. Therefore, the combined total of the first two complexes is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]

"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to consider the production for each year from age 5 to age 10, as the tree does not produce any fruit before age 5.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

To find the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's solve this step by step, using the information given:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. Then:
- The length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
- The length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The total length of the three ropes is given by:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. Therefore, the length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12

   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we can expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the cost per book:**
   - Bob can buy 100 books for $500.
   - Therefore, the cost per book is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:**
   - Using the cost per book, we can find the total number of books:
     \[
     \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of books per school:**
   - Bob is distributing the books equally among 3 schools. Therefore, the number of books per school is:
     \[
     \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books}
     \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Snowball Production Rate:**
   - Jay can build 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Snowball Melting Rate:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Snowball Production:**
   - The net number of snowballs Jay can make in one hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net production rate:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backward from the final count.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"As a connoisseur of fine spirits, I can break down the costs for you with precision.

First, the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

The total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount John spends on everything:

"To determine how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of balloons they started with.
2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons.

First, let's calculate the total number of balloons:
- They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.
- Therefore, the total number of balloons is \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \).

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon:
- By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left.
- Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is \( 300 - 12 = 288 \).

So, the number of balloons they threw is 288.

"To calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to determine the total volume of one dose. 

Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 

The amount of the second medicine is:
3 * 14 mL = 42 mL

The total volume of one dose is:
14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

To find the total volume for 8 doses, we multiply the volume of one dose by 8:
56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

Therefore, the total volume of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.
   - Since Ali teaches only one class, the total capacity of Ali's school is 120 students.

2. **John's School:**
   - Each of John's classes has a capacity that is 1/8 of Ali's class.
   - The capacity of each of John's classes is \( \frac{120}{8} = 15 \) students.
   - John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's school is \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) students.

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of the capacities of Ali's school and John's school.
   - Therefore, the combined capacity is \( 120 + 30 = 150 \) students.

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Diaper Changes per Day:**
   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   - Jordan has 2 children.
   - Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day is \( 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \).

2. **Diaper Changes by Jordan's Wife:**
   - Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles is \( \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \).

3. **Diaper Changes by Jordan:**
   - The total number of diaper changes per day is 10.
   - Jordan's wife changes 5 of these.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is \( 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \).

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by jelly beans.
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Thus, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two main parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year.
   - She visits the museum for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**
   - Total cost for 5 years before the price increase = $30.
   - Total cost for 3 years after the price increase = $45.
   - Total cost for all visits = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

2. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

3. Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

4. The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]

5. Substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
   \[
   c + (3c - 2) = 10
   \]

6. Combine like terms:
   \[
   4c - 2 = 10
   \]

7. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
   \[
   4c = 12
   \]

8. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
   \[
   c = 3

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - So, the price in December was $72.

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36
     \]
   - So, the price in January was $36.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought:
- Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs.
- Each dozen costs $2.40.
- Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, determine the total number of eggs:
- 1 dozen = 12 eggs
- 5 dozens = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Now, calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs.
- Number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets
- Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, calculate Rose's profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

Therefore, Rose's profit is $8.00.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the sale price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and it is discounted by $3.00, so the sale price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we divide the sale price by the number of sticks in the bag to find the cost per stick. There are 30 sticks in the bag, so:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
   \[ B = 5S - 4 \]
2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   \[ S + B = 116 \]

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Flashlights:**
   - Each of the 4 people in the house has a flashlight.
   - Each of the 8 rooms has 2 flashlights.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 + (2 * 8) = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - Half of the 8 rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the 8 rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.
   - Total small candles = 4 small candles/room * 4 rooms = 16 small candles
   - Total medium candles = 5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms = 20 medium candles
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

"To solve the Rubik's cube, let's break down the time taken for each side:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's sum up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the land segment and the water segment. Each segment is half of the total distance, which is 200 yards.

1. **Distance on Land**: 
   \[
   \text{Distance on Land} = \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]

2. **Distance in Water**: 
   \[
   \text{Distance in Water} = \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to travel each segment:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}

   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg requires 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table needs \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).
5. James has 40 screws in total.

Now, we subtract the number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

2. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"As the caretaker of the docks, I need to ensure I have enough line to secure the docks properly. For every foot of dock, I require 3 feet of line. Given that there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:

\[ 3 \text{ feet of line} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

I currently have 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line I need to purchase is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, I need to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to break down the costs and the number of reservations per night, and then multiply by the number of days the restaurant is open each week.

Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each, totaling \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- 1 bottle of wine at $5.

So, the total revenue per reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night, so the revenue per night is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"As a fruit vendor, I understand the importance of calculating costs and profits accurately to ensure a successful business. Here’s how I would calculate the selling price per watermelon:

1. **Determine the total cost of the watermelons:**
   - I bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - The profit margin is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the peeling rate for each person:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange. Therefore, her peeling rate is \( \frac{1 \text{ orange}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \).
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange. Therefore, her peeling rate is \( \frac{1 \text{ orange}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \).

2. **Calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in one hour:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Ana's peeling rate in oranges per hour: \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).
   - Jane's peeling rate in oranges per hour: \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among the 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends):

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices.
