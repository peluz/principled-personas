"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value.
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = New value of the house - Total investment
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.
- The cost for one pair is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

There are 8 pairs in 16 glasses:
- Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Thus, Kylar needs to pay:

"Given the problem, we can use algebra to solve it systematically. Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

We are given:
1. Seattle has 20 sheep: \( S = 20 \).
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle: \( C = 4S \).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston: \( T = 2C \).

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the initial partial download, the Windows restart, and the full re-download.

1. **Initial Partial Download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Full Re-Download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The time to download the full 200 GB file is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

He then turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. During this return trip, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance he covers on his return trip is:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular and overtime components.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She works 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings Calculation:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**

   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

First, we calculate the total time required to achieve the desired average speed:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:

\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:

\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Account for the spill:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled.
   - The remaining amount of orange drink is:
     \[
     10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink:**
   - Since the remaining orange drink is still two-thirds water, the amount of water in 9 liters is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the final mixture:**
   - The total volume of the mixture is:
     \[
     9 \text{ liters (remaining orange drink)} + 15 \text{ liters (pineapple drink)} = 24 \text{ liters}

"To find the original price of the book before the discount, we can use the relationship between the discounted price and the original price. Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

The equation representing this relationship is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To solve for \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know the cost of the first pair of high heels is \( \$33 \).

The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = \$66 \).

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = \$99 \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and their total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:

\[
7x + 11x = 162
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
18x = 162
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
\]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:

- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[
99 + 10 = 109
\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the mean of the guesses provided by Gunter's friends. Let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the daily care time for all dogs:**
   - Each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day.
   - John has 10 dogs.
   - Therefore, the total daily care time is:
     \[
     10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weekly care time:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly care time is:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

Thus, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Given the problem, we can start by defining the relationships between the number of jewels each person has. Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as \( R \), the number of jewels Aaron has as \( A \), and the number of jewels Siobhan has as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Raymond has 40 jewels, so \( R = 40 \).
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so \( A = \frac{R}{2} + 5 \).
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so \( S = A - 2 \).

First, we calculate the number of jewels Aaron has:
\[
A = \frac{40}{2} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of jewels Siobhan has:
\[
S = 25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

1. **Points scored in the first 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 4 points.

2. **Points scored in the second 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.
   - To find 25% of 4 points:
     \[
     0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
     \]
   - Therefore, the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total points scored:**
   - Add the points from both periods:
     \[
     4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
     \]

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of yogurts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per yogurt:**
   - The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - The cost per yogurt is:
     \[
     \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**
   - The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
     \[
     60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

"John initially has 13 lego sets. He sells each lego set for $15, so the total amount he earns from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games, each costing $20, so the total cost of the video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total amount he spent on the video games and the remaining money is:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he started with $195 and spent $165, the calculation checks out. Therefore, after selling all his lego sets and buying the video games, John has no lego sets left.

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week. 

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time spent running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles each week.

To find his average speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speeds at which Dana can run and walk, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the dragon's flame reach:**
   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.

3. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the company's pension policy. According to the policy, Marcy is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 if she works for 40 years. However, starting after 20 years of service, she becomes eligible for 5% of the full pension value for each additional year of service.

First, let's calculate the number of years Marcy has worked beyond the 20-year mark:
\[ 30 \text{ years} - 20 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years} \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of the full pension she is entitled to for these additional 10 years:
\[ 10 \text{ years} \times 5\% = 50\% \]

Now, we calculate 50% of the full pension value:
\[ 50\% \times \$50,000 = \$25,000 \]

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service will be:
\[ \$25,000 \]

"Given the relationships between the ages of Emily's children, we can set up a series of equations to solve for Jackson's age. Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James as \( A \), \( J \), \( C \), and \( M \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

First, we can use the information about James and Corey to find Corey's age:
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Next, we use Corey's age to find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, we use Amy's age to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's new time for running the 400-meter hurdles after his speed improvement. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means he can run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - Gerald's improved time is \( 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \) seconds.

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, which includes dogs, cats, and rabbits. We are given the following information:

1. The number of dogs is 60.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.

First, let's calculate the number of cats:
\[
\text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we find the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[
\text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

Now, we determine the number of rabbits:
\[
\text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
\]

Finally, we calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
\]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the volume of tomatoes before and after cooking, and how many tomatoes are in each can.

1. **Volume Reduction**: When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, the volume is reduced by half. This means the initial volume of tomatoes is twice the volume of the sauce produced.

2. **Volume of Sauce**: Freda made 32 ounces of sauce. Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking was:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Volume per Can**: Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume of tomatoes by the volume per can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Driving Through**:
   - Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
   - 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
3. **Cars Taking an Exit**: 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

The total number of cars initially is 30, so the equation is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"Mary, an avid gardener, received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges in her large country home. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. To determine how many potted plants Mary will have left, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:
   - Plants already on the ledges: \(2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}\)
   - New plants received: \(18 \text{ plants}\)
   - Total plants: \(80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants}\)

2. Calculate the number of plants Mary will give away:
   - Plants given away: \(1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}\)

3. Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants:
   - Remaining plants: \(98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}\)

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Summing these times:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Given that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, Henry intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]
\[ 2x = 115 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]

"To determine Sasha's profit from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate both the total cost of the lumber she originally purchased and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach to determine the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.30L = 1.30L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \approx 30769.23
   \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000
   \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), we can calculate her new salary as follows:
   \[
   \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 + 12307.69 = 43076.92
   \]

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   \[
   \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92

"To determine the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael, we need to calculate the individual contributions and then sum them up.

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kael brought:
- Twice the number of apples Morisette brought: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges Morisette brought: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette's total: \(5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits}\)
- Kael's total: \(10 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ fruits}\)

Adding these totals together gives us the combined number of fruits:
- Total fruits: \(13 + 14 = 27\)

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   - Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day.
   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday: \(6 + 6 = 12\) hours.

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   - She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - Therefore, on these days, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.
   - Total for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

4. **Total sleep for the week:**
   - Add the hours from all the days together.

"To calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to consider her running speeds at different intervals. 

1. For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The distance covered in this period is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the next 4 hours, her speed decreases to 5 miles per hour. The distance covered in this period is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The total distance covered in 7 hours is the sum of the distances from both intervals:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles.

"Jennie is assisting at her mother's office and has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She stamps one-third of these letters. To find out how many letters she stamped, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

This means Jennie stamped 20 letters. After stamping, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. To find out how many letters were already in the pile when Jennie started, we subtract the number of letters she stamped from the current total:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information provided:

- Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.
- Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons.
- Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
- After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons left.

We can set up the equation as follows:

1. The total number of spoons Julia had after her husband's contribution is \( x + 5 \).
2. After using 3 spoons to sample the stew, the number of spoons left is \( x + 5 - 3 \).
3. According to the problem, this number is equal to 12.

So, we have the equation:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:
\[ 10 \]"

"To determine the total number of tickets Pam and Fred used at the carnival, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rides each person took.
2. Sum the total number of rides for both individuals.
3. Multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride to find the total number of tickets used.

First, let's calculate the total number of rides for each person:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. Therefore, Pam's total number of rides is \(2 + 2 = 4\).
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times. Therefore, Fred's total number of rides is \(4 + 2 = 6\).

Next, we sum the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred:
- Total rides = \(4 + 6 = 10\).

"To solve the problem, we can break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the miles walked on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
   - On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday = \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:**
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = miles on Monday + miles on Tuesday
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.

3. **Determine the miles walked on Wednesday:**
   - The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.
   - Miles walked on Wednesday = total miles from Monday to Wednesday - total miles from Monday to Tuesday
   - Miles walked on Wednesday = \( 41 - 28 = 13 \) miles.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To determine the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return as the number that left in the first 6 hours.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):

- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting:

"To determine the total earnings from the bike inflation service, we need to calculate the cost for inflating the tires of bicycles, tricycles, and a unicycle, and then sum these costs.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people each had both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people each had all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person had their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[
10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires}

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries:
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:
   \[
   x - 21 - (3 \times 3) = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. Ants carried off one fry:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. Five fries were left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
\[
x = 48
\]

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( 48 \).

   - Jean is two years older than Mark: 
     \[
     J = M + 2
     \]
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     M - 2 = 14 + 5
     \]

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   \[
   M = 19 + 2
   \]
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 21 + 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 23
   \]

So, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning margin between the two teams in the 4 by 400 meter relay, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the race.

**Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team):**
- Each of the four members runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team 1: \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so they complete it in \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they complete it in \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they complete it in \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds.
- Total time for Team 2: \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

The difference in their total times is:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \]

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{\text{Number of even numbers}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"
"Given that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate the total number of apples they both picked. If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, then Jenna picked \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) apples. Therefore, the total number of apples picked by both is \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total straw for the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \) pieces.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, with one hamster per cage.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total straw for the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) pieces.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can now set up the equation for the total straw:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 18r = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after \( n \) months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let \( x \) represent the number of bags.

1. **Cost Price per Bag**: The trader buys each bag for $20 and incurs a transportation cost of $2 per bag. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
   \[
   20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Selling Price per Bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30. Therefore, the profit per bag is:
   \[
   30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400. The total profit can be expressed as the profit per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold:
   \[
   8x = 400
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To determine how much each of the three friends paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of Tickets:**
   - The total cost for 3 tickets is $20.25.

2. **Cost of Food:**
   - They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
   - Therefore, the cost of food is \( 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \).

3. **Cost of Rides:**
   - Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the rides is \( 33 \times 2 = 66 \).

4. **Total Expenses:**
   - Adding up all the costs:
   \[
   20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102
   \]

5. **Cost per Person:**

"To determine the daily insect consumption for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement for the entire flock. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:

\[ 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert this weekly requirement into a daily requirement. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly requirement by 7:

\[ 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \div 7 \, \text{days/week} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Number of Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual Changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of Trees After 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees That Die After 10 Years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final Number of Trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for \( d \) and \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can use the information provided and set up a simple equation.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

Given the conditions:
1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, we express the amounts of water in the pools 4 minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

From the first condition:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

From the second condition:
\[ B = 4S \]

We substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Thus, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, including the 10% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay an additional 10% interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months, paying $165 each month:

\[ \text{Total Paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance:

\[ \text{Remaining Balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

\[ 220 \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of flower in the vase. We know there are 4 roses. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias can be calculated as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Next, we find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

     \[
     \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Harriet is half the age of Zack:
     \[
     \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Ages in Three Years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Average Age in Three Years:**
   - The average age is calculated by summing their ages in three years and dividing by the number of individuals:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial amount of water in the tank and the amount used by Celine.

1. **Initial amount of water in the tank**: 120 liters.
2. **Water used by Celine**: 90 liters.

After Celine uses 90 liters, the amount of water left in the tank is:
\[ 120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Next, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ 2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives us the total amount of water in the tank now:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, which includes both geraniums and petunias.

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. According to the problem, he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Therefore, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

\[ \text{Number of petunias} = \text{Number of geraniums} - 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of geraniums} + \text{Number of petunias} \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 90 + 50 = 140 \]

Thus, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

"James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards. After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the new counts are:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Calculating the percentage:

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the number of active pen pals:**
   Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped corresponding with 2 of them.
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3
   \]
   So, Mike has 3 active pen pals.

2. **Determine the total number of letters received per week:**
   Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week.
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]
   Therefore, Mike receives 6 letters each week.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response:**
   Each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike responds to each letter with an equal number of pages.
   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30
   \]
   So, Mike needs to write 30 pages each week.

4. **Determine the total time spent writing:**
   Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   \[
   30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, Mike spends 180 minutes writing each week.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   \[
   \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"To determine the number of minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly allowance.

1. **Daily calls with the boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for calls with the boss: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Extra calls to other people:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total minutes used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for calls with the boss + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Minutes remaining:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes remaining = Monthly allowance - Total minutes used
   - Minutes remaining = \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

"Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Fries:**
   Griffin starts with 24 fries.

2. **Fries Taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin has 19 fries left.

3. **Fries Taken by Billy:**
   Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy takes 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin has 9 fries left.

4. **Fries Given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin.

5. **Fries Taken by Colby:**
   Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby takes 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of times each child went down the water slide, starting with Mitchel and then using that information to find the number of times Anne and Robert went down the slide.

1. **Mitchel's Slide Count:**
   Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

2. **Anne's Slide Count:**
   Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find this, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's count and subtract it from Mitchel's total:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9
   \]
   Therefore, Anne went down the slide:
   \[
   30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times}
   \]

3. **Robert's Slide Count:**
   Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find this, we multiply Anne's count by 4:
   \[
   4 \times 21 = 84
   \]

Thus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial number of cows in the stalls. There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows added to each stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

After adding the new cows, the total number of cows in each stall becomes:
\[ 20 \text{ cows per stall} + 2 \text{ cows per stall} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:**
   - The tree is 200 feet tall.
   - Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
   - The total number of 10-foot sections in the tree is \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
   - Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate:**
   - The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
   - The weight of the wood eaten by the termites is \( 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the remaining weight of the tree:**
   - The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided:

Let \( J_a \) represent the number of apples Jamal has, and \( J_b \) represent the number of bananas Jamal has. Similarly, let \( A_a \) represent the number of apples Andrea has, and \( A_b \) represent the number of bananas Andrea has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we can use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the number of apples Jamal has to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we can start by breaking down the total number of stitches used for the different parts of the sweater.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Next, we sum the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total project is 1800 stitches, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time required for each type of hole and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole: 3 minutes
- Number of small holes: 30
- Total time for small holes: \( 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole: 10 minutes
- Number of large holes: 15
- Total time for large holes: \( 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we sum the total times for both types of holes:
- Total time: \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \)

"To solve this problem, we can use basic algebra. Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( K \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 20:

\[ M + K = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( K + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (K + 10) \]

Simplifying this expression:

\[ M + K + 10 + 10 = M + K + 20 \]

Since \( M + K = 20 \):

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. To determine how many cents she will have left after buying a can of pop for 55 cents, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she has.

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

First, we calculate the number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of stars in the two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, given its speed.

First, we know the speed of the car in the fast lane is 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the slow lane car is 30 miles per hour, we can calculate the time as follows:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the total weekly consumption is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}

"To determine Watson's total earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus he receives if the company performs well. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - Number of weeks in April: \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.29 \) weeks.
   - Total working days in April: \( 4.29 \times 5 \approx 21.45 \) days.
   - Since he can't work a fraction of a day, we round down to 21 days.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Number of weeks in April: 4 weeks.
   - Total bonus for April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2100.
   - Total bonus: $1200.
   - Total earnings: \( 2100 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3300 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Loaves Produced:**
   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Morning Sales:**
   Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Loaves Remaining After Morning Sales:**
   Subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total loaves produced:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Afternoon and Evening Sales:**
   Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
   These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so:

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, his weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Weekly weight loss}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Theo has a budget of $6000 for his business trip to South Africa. He plans to spend this amount on various items and save $2000 for other expenses. Let's break down his planned expenditures:

1. **Business Suits**: Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Suitcases**: He also buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Flight Ticket**: The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   \[
   5 \times 100 + 700 = 500 + 700 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up these expenses:
\[
600 \text{ (suits)} + 150 \text{ (suitcases)} + 1200 \text{ (flight)} = 1950 \text{ dollars}
\]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the total amount he plans to spend is:
\[
6000 \text{ (total budget)} - 2000 \text{ (savings)} = 4000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting the total expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
\[
4000 \text{ (planned spending)} - 1950 \text{ (expenses)} = 2050 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Theo has \(\boxed{2050}\) dollars to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided to set up equations and solve for the unknowns. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.
- The total number of players on the team is 105.

We can set up the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is given as $0.1. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

   - They earn $1 off for every $20 spent.
   - Rewards earned = \(\frac{80}{20} = 4\).

2. **Determine the total discount applied:**
   - The customer used 4 rewards, which means a $4 discount.
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of the rewards off the price.
   - Discount from the coupon = \(2 \times 4 = 8\).
   - Total discount = \(4 + 8 = 12\).

3. **Calculate the amount paid on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $43.
   - Total discount = $12.
   - Amount paid = \(43 - 12 = 31\).

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \]

Thus, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, which is 10 students fewer than each of the other groups, will have \( x - 10 \) students.

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 70 \]

Now, we find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from \( x \):

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To determine the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

First, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the second equation to find \( H \):
\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, there are 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Given the problem, we can start by identifying the weights of each animal based on the information provided:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The container weighs 20 pounds.

The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, red bird, and the container:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount ($3,650),
   - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (10% or 0.10),
   - \( t \) is the time in years (5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year).

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   I = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   \[
   A = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   A = 3802.50

"To determine the total cost Tyson will incur for the meat and cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people, we can break down the problem into a few straightforward steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Total number of people = 20.
   - Number of sandwiches required = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Determine the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has after his purchases. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so the initial number of corns is:
     \[
     2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
     \]

2. **After Purchases:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:
     \[
     40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
     \]
   - He buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is:
     \[
     100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
     \]

3. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total of corns and cannolis is:
     \[
     100 \text{ cannolis} + 60 \text{ corns} = 160

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his goal, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. Additionally, he walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After these activities, he went for a jog and found that he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can set up the following equation:

Total steps = Steps to and from school + Steps with friend + Steps during jog + Steps left

10,000 = 5,000 + 1,000 + Steps during jog + 2,000

Simplifying the equation:

10,000 = 8,000 + Steps during jog

Subtract 8,000 from both sides:

Steps during jog = 10,000 - 8,000

Steps during jog = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of words in the book.
2. Determine the time it takes Toby to read the book.
3. Calculate the total time Toby has before he needs to leave for the airport.
4. Determine how many minutes early Toby will be.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words per page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine the time it takes Toby to read the book:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, the total time he needs to leave by is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, he will have:

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

The total payment for one employee in May is:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total payment for all employees in May is:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

The total payment for one employee in June is:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total payment for all employees in June is:

"Sally went to the seashore for vacation and was given $10 by her parents to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She bought 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50, and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. We need to determine how much money Sally has left after her purchases.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound of taffy is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
- The total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells:
- The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets:
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Adding up all the costs:
- Total cost of taffy: $4.50
- Total cost of seashells: $1.50
- Total cost of magnets: $1.00
- Total expenditure: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total expenditure from her initial amount:
- Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided and then solve for the unknown quantity, which is the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

Let's denote:
- \( J_t \) as the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.
- \( J_s \) as the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
- \( J_a \) as the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
- \( S_t \) as the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the tallest trees.
- \( S_s \) as the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.
- \( S_a \) as the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the average trees.

From the problem, we know:
- \( J_t = 30 \)
- \( J_s = \frac{J_t}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)
- \( S_t = 2 \times J_t = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- \( S_s = 3 \times J_s = 3 \times 15 = 45 \)
- \( S_a = 0 \)

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ J_t + J_s + J_a + S_t + S_s + S_a = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 30 + 15 + J_a + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + J_a = 500 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):

\[ J_a = 500 - 150 \]
\[ J_a = 350 \]

Thus, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:
1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each):
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56

2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker}
   \]
   Substituting the given value:
   \[
   5 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker}
   \]
   Solving for Zack's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}

3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker}
   \]
   Substituting the value we found for Zack's locker:
   \[
   20 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker}
   \]
   Solving for Timothy's locker:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of cats on the rock, which is 50. 

Next, we account for the cats that were carried away by the four boats. Each boat carried away 5 cats, so the total number of cats removed by the boats is:
\[ 4 \text{ boats} \times 5 \text{ cats/boat} = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Subtracting the number of cats carried away by the boats from the initial number of cats, we find the number of cats remaining on the rock:
\[ 50 \text{ cats} - 20 \text{ cats} = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats ran after the mouse, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 \text{ cats} = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtracting the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats, we get the final number of cats left on the rock:
\[ 30 \text{ cats} - 18 \text{ cats} = 12 \text{ cats} \]

Thus, the number of cats left on the rock is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, and then find the difference between these original prices.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Number of homemade bird feeders**: 3
2. **Number of store-bought bird feeders**: 3
3. **Birds attracted by each store-bought feeder**: 20
4. **Birds attracted by each homemade feeder**: 20 + 10 = 30

First, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Thus, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To determine the number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Kenny sells his cards for $1.5 each and keeps 1/3 of them. The money he makes from selling the cards is used to buy a $100 amusement park ticket and leaves him with $50 in spending cash.

Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with. Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells \( \frac{2}{3}C \) cards. The revenue from selling these cards is given by:

\[ \text{Revenue} = \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 \]

We know that the total revenue is $150 (since $100 is for the ticket and $50 is for spending cash):

\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - The caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. This means 18 guests (half of 36) would get 2 hot dogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hot dog each.
   - The total number of hot dogs prepared is:
     \[
     18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is:
     \[
     80 - 54 = 26 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{1} = 26 \text{ guests}
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we start by calculating the weight of each piece. Given that the cake weighs 20 ounces and is divided into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
\]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the total weight of the pieces they have consumed is:

\[
2.5 \text{ ounces/piece} \times 2 \text{ pieces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

Subtracting the weight of the consumed pieces from the total weight of the cake gives us the weight of the remaining cake:

\[
20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the given length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

We are given that the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - With the super ticket, you get one popcorn and one soda for an additional $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost with the super ticket is \( 20 + 1 = 21 \) dollars.

2. **Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The regular movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let \( P \) be the regular price of the popcorn.
   - Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \) dollars.

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 + P = 21 - 2
     \]
     \[
     15 + P = 19
     \]
     \[
     P = 19 - 15
     \]
     \[
     P = 4
     \]

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per helium balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

After the price increase, the cost per balloon is increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley went to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. The total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price is:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then use these to find the average speed.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
     \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, each worth $800. Therefore, the initial value of her sapphires is:

\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires traded is:

\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies she receives is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, Jenna has:

- 5 sapphires left (since she traded 3 out of her 8 sapphires)
- 2 rubies

The value of the remaining 5 sapphires is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of carrot sticks Matt must eat to be allowed to have five cookies. The relationship between the number of carrot sticks and the number of cookies is given by the equation:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of carrot sticks} + 2 \]

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks. We are given that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides by 2:

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that this combined length represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are two remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 0.1 \times 100\% = 10\% \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. This principle helps us avoid double-counting students who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( |A| \) as the number of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( |B| \) as the number of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( |A \cap B| \) as the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.
- \( |A \cup B| \) as the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \)
- \( |B| = 6 \)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we calculate the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |A \cup B| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides. 

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups, and each group consists of 200 employees.
- Therefore, the total number of employees is \( 3 \times 200 = 600 \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
- Therefore, the total number of tour guides is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
- Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
- Total number of people = \( 600 + 21 = 621 \).

Thus, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather effectively gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:

- **Bottom layer**: 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
- **Second layer**: 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
- **Third layer**: 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
- **Top layer**: 1 cheerleader, 60 inches tall (the shortest).

First, we calculate the total height for each layer:

1. **Bottom layer**:
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer**:
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the costs provided for each venue.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):

"To determine the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that fraction into yards, given that a full skein contains 364 yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Next, we convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein into yards. Since one full skein is 364 yards, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To maximize the number of sticks, we should consider the cost-effectiveness of each type of wood. The cost per stick for each type is:
     - For 2 x 4: \(\frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{200 \text{ sticks}} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick}\)
     - For 2 x 8: \(\frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{400 \text{ sticks}} = 0.015 \text{ dollars per stick}\)

   - The 2 x 8 piece of wood is more cost-effective, but the question specifies that Frederick should buy the cheapest lumber. Therefore, we will focus on the 2 x 4 pieces.

4. **Calculating the Number of 2 x 4 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, he can buy \(\frac{24}{4} = 6\) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \(6 \times 200 = 1200\) sticks.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( x \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
Let \( y \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

From the problem, we have:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by July 19th, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:**
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July: 19 days

   Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
   - Each pound of weight loss requires a deficit of 3500 calories.
   - Total calories to lose 30 pounds = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   - Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
   - Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the total cost equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \). Similarly, let \( C_J \) and \( S_J \) represent the number of chairs and sofas Jenna has, respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
3. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
4. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).

First, we use the information about Ophelia's sofas to find the number of chairs she has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we determine the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad receives, and \( J \) represent the amount of money Jeff receives. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, which can be expressed as:

\[ J = 4B \]

We also know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so:

\[ J + B = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 4B + B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( B = 20 \) back into the equation \( J = 4B \):

\[ J = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference between these times.

1. **Cold Water:**
   - Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time taken is:
     \[
     3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Warm Water:**
   - Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water.
   - Twice the time it takes in cold water is:
     \[
     2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
     \[
     32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time taken is:

"Given the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided:

1. Let \( R \) represent the number of goals Richie scored.
2. Let \( M \) represent the number of goals Mark scored.
3. Let \( A \) represent the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we know:
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: \( R = M + 20 \)
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: \( R = A + 45 \)
- Richie scored 80 goals: \( R = 80 \)

Using the value of \( R \), we can solve for \( M \) and \( A \):

1. \( R = M + 20 \)
   \[
   80 = M + 20 \implies M = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

2. \( R = A + 45 \)

"To address the issue with Maggie's oven, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting:

1. The set temperature is 450 degrees, but the actual temperature is 468 degrees.
2. The difference between the set and actual temperatures is \(468 - 450 = 18\) degrees.
3. The percentage error is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% error.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:
\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount applied. 

The original price for one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price for one box is:
\[ 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Therefore, the cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:

"To determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total number of calories she burns during her exercise session. 

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, and each hour burns 500 calories.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running, and each hour burns 600 calories.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Next, we sum the total calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. Therefore, we calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink:
- Water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 800 ml.

Thus, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can determine the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days it will take for a beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles its height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( h(n) \). The initial height is 4 feet, and the height doubles each day. Therefore, the height on day \( n \) can be expressed as:

\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( h(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height for each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

- Day 0: \( h(0) = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \) feet
- Day 1: \( h(1) = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \) feet
- Day 2: \( h(2) = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \) feet
- Day 3: \( h(3) = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \) feet

"To solve the problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \). According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Distribute the 2 on the right-hand side:
   \[ J = 2J - 10 \]

2. Subtract \( J \) from both sides to isolate the variable:
   \[ 0 = J - 10 \]

3. Add 10 to both sides to solve for \( J \):
   \[ J = 10 \]

"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to cover the cost of his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental procedures and then determine the remaining amount he needs to pay after his deposit. Finally, we will calculate the number of hours he needs to work to earn this remaining amount.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base cost of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}

   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an additional cost of $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the angles in the triangle. Let the smallest angle be \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- The third angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To determine the total number of video games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into a series of steps, considering the games he receives and buys over the specified period.

1. **Initial Games:**
   - Steve starts with 5 games from his birthday.

2. **Games Purchased:**
   - In the first year, he buys 1 game per month for 12 months:
     \[
     1 \text{ game/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ games}
     \]
   - In the second year, he buys 2 games per month for 12 months:
     \[
     2 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ games}
     \]
   - In the third year, he buys 4 games per month for 12 months:
     \[
     4 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ games}
     \]

3. **Games Received for Christmas:**
   - He receives 5 games each Christmas for 3 years:
     \[
     5 \text{ games/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ games}
     \]

4. **Total Games:**
   - Adding all the games together:
     \[
     5 \text{ (initial)} + 12 \text{ (first year)} + 24 \text{ (second year)} + 48 \text{ (third year)} + 15 \text{ (Christmas)} = 104 \text{ games}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is:

"To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to calculate the speed of the plane.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

The speed of the plane is calculated as:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa in pounds of chocolates per hour.

Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, his production rate is:
\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's production rate is:
\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each of them can produce in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:
\[ \text{Ruiz's total} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ \text{Marissa's total} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates produced by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total production:
\[ \text{Total production} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine the total earnings from selling lemonade over a 6-hour period, we can break down the problem into two segments based on the different rates of sales and prices.

1. **First 4 Hours:**
   - Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.50.
   - Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
   - Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.00.

2. **Next 2 Hours:**
   - Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.60.
   - Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
   - Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.00.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from the first 4 hours + Earnings from the next 2 hours.
   - Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per mile is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the total number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. Therefore, the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the tire will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can start by calculating the total number of pumps available in the jumbo bottle. Given that the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after purchasing the outfit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- The shirt costs $25.
- The shorts cost $35.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Thus, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:

"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need to make croissants for a week, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Butter per dozen croissants**: It is given that 1/4 pound of butter is required to make 1 dozen croissants.

2. **Butter for 4 dozen croissants**: Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants each day, we need to calculate the butter required for 4 dozen:
   \[
   \text{Butter for 4 dozen} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound} = 1 \text{ pound}
   \]

3. **Butter for a week**: Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants each day for 7 days. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for the week is:
   \[
   \text{Total butter for 7 days} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the repaving costs for both streets and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 95060 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find the difference in cost:
\[
\text{Difference} = 95060 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65960 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Monthly funding for the first 5 months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000

2. **Extended period:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for the additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Initial 5 months cost + Additional 45 months cost
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we start by calculating the total number of seats available. Given that there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. To find the number of remaining seats, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

Of the remaining seats, one-third were occupied by the parents. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Thus, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the truck towed 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the truck towed 4 fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. Thus, the number of cars towed each day for the last four days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

The total number of cars towed in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the totals from both parts of the week gives us the total number of cars towed:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"To determine James's earnings from his job selling used cars, we need to calculate the total sales, the cost to the company for acquiring the cars, the profit, and finally, James's commission based on the profit.

1. **Total Sales:**
   James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000.
   \[
   \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total sales minus the total acquisition cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **James's Commission:**
   James receives a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a few straightforward steps:

1. **Determine the total number of riders who can stay upright:**
   - Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:
     \[
     100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of women who can stay upright:**
   - We know that 60% of the 25 riders who can stay upright are women, so:
     \[
     25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of men who can stay upright:**
   - The remaining riders who can stay upright are men. Therefore, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
     \[
     25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men}
     \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the prices of the gold and silver jewels based on the given information and then sum the prices of all three jewels.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond jewell is given as $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = \text{Price of a Diamond Jewell} + \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} + \text{Price of a Silver Jewell}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the relative speed:**
   - Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.
   - The relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is the difference in their speeds:
     \[
     \text{Relative speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to close the gap:**
   - The initial distance between Tom and Bob is 75 miles.
   - Using the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed, we get:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we can use the information provided to set up a series of equations and then solve for the number of fish Tommy caught.

1. Let \( N \) represent the number of fish Naomi caught. According to the problem, \( N = 17 \).
2. Let \( D \) represent the number of fish Darren caught. The problem states that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so:
   \[
   D = N - 6
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 17 \):
   \[
   D = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]
3. Let \( T \) represent the number of fish Tommy caught. The problem states that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so:
   \[
   T = D + 3
   \]
   Substituting \( D = 11 \):

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 total classes. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate the number of customers each processes daily and then extend that to a weekly total.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Similarly, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of 1/5 pound of almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sally has. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, and we know Janey has 21 books. This can be expressed as:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first isolate the term involving \( S \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional growth needed to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height, given its growth rate.

First, convert the current height from feet to inches:
- Current height = 20 feet
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height in inches = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Next, calculate the additional growth needed:
- Desired height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Additional growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

Now, determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Number of days = 360 / 30 = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of cookies each person has and then use the given information to find the total number of cookies.

Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61

4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:

"To determine the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

"To determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then extend that to the total period.

First, let's calculate Rong's monthly savings:
- Rong saves 20 coins every month.

Next, we calculate Neil's monthly savings:
- Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 
- The additional amount Neil saves is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) coins.
- Therefore, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins every month.

Now, we calculate the total savings over ten years (120 months):
- Rong's total savings: \( 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \).
- Neil's total savings: \( 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \).

"To determine the total price of a crate of fresh fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs. The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The prices are as follows:

- One apple costs $0.50.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - Number of bananas: 5
   - Cost per banana: $1.00
   - Total cost for bananas: \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - Number of apples: 12
   - Cost per apple: $0.50
   - Total cost for apples: \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Number of oranges: 7
   - Cost per orange: $3.00
   - Total cost for oranges: \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars

Finally, we sum the total costs for all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:

\[
5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the price for the crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by each student and then compare this total to the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find this, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Thus:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

"To determine the number of pizza slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by Bryce and his four friends and then subtract this from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = (2/3) * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = (3/4) * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages.

First, let's establish the time it takes for each animal to eat the sausages:
- The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.
- The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the dog's time is:
  \[
  \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the given relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total number of windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Number of windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total number of windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Number of windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Finally, we sum the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total number of windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   \[
   \text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150
   \]

2. **Number of Blue Spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   \[
   \text{Total blue spools} = 15 + 45 = 60
   \]

3. **Percentage of Blue Spools:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

   Converting to a percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of blue spools is 40%.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and using the information provided to set up equations.

Let \( D \) represent Dora's age, \( F \) represent Dora's father's age, and \( M \) represent Dora's mother's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Dora's age \( D = 15 \).
2. Dora's father's age \( F \) is eight more than twice Dora's age.
3. Dora's mother's age \( M \) is four years younger than Dora's father's age.

First, we express Dora's father's age in terms of Dora's age:
\[ F = 2D + 8 \]

Substituting Dora's age \( D = 15 \) into the equation:
\[ F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we express Dora's mother's age in terms of Dora's father's age:
\[ M = F - 4 \]

Substituting Dora's father's age \( F = 38 \) into the equation:
\[ M = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"In a student council election, candidate A received 20% of the votes. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. The remaining votes were given to candidate C. Given that there were 100 voters, we can calculate the number of votes each candidate received as follows:

1. Calculate the number of votes for candidate A:
   - Candidate A received 20% of 100 votes.
   - \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) votes.

2. Calculate the number of votes for candidate B:
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% of 20 votes is \( 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \) votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B received \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) votes.

3. Calculate the number of votes for candidate C:
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - The votes for candidates A and B together are \( 20 + 30 = 50 \) votes.
   - Therefore, candidate C received \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) votes.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the total number of students and the distribution of their hobbies. The class consists of 50 students. According to the given information:

- 10 students like to bake.
- 5 students like to play basketball.
- The rest of the students like either to play video games or play music.

We are also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students:

\[ 50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:

1. Sean has 56 marbles, so \( S = 56 \).
2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so \( C = 4S \).
3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so \( S = \frac{1}{2}L \) or \( L = 2S \).

First, we calculate the number of marbles Carl has:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we calculate the number of marbles Cal has:
\[ L = 2S = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, we find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined:
\[ C + L = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is:

   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

4. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - After trading 20 large stickers, she has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons from these remaining large stickers.

5. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 27 small buttons.
   - From trading remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \) small buttons.

6. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.

7. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons, so 20 large buttons are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, and \( A \) represent the number of votes against it.

We know two things:
1. The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against: \( F = 2A \).
2. The total number of votes is 33: \( F + A = 33 \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( A \):

\[ F + A = 33 \]
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( F \) using the first equation:

\[ F = 2A \]
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distances covered both by driving and hiking, and then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but 1.5 hours were spent hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = \text{Driving Time} \times \text{Driving Speed} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = \text{Hiking Time} \times \text{Hiking Speed} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Driving Distance} + \text{Hiking Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to break down the scoring system and the given conditions.

1. **Scoring System:**
   - 10 points for each enemy jumped on.
   - 5 points for each berry collected.
   - 30 points for each second left on the timer when the level is completed.

2. **Given Conditions:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Let's define the variables:
- \( E \) = number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) = number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) = number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Using these variables, we can express the scores for both players:

**Emma's Score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5B \)
- Points from timer: \( 30T \)
- Total score for Emma: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)

**Ava's Score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
- Points from timer: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)
- Total score for Ava: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

**Difference in Scores:**
- Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
- Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)
- Difference: \( (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) = 25 \)

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the rides on the usual days and the rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Initially, Bob has 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white. He then buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob buys.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob buys.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying \( x \) white fish and \( y \) orange fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \) and the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \). Therefore:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

   - Total passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students.

3. **Calculate the total number of students who took the test:**
   - Total students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.

4. **Calculate the overall pass rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = \( \frac{\text{Total passed}}{\text{Total students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%.

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of glass chips Milo has and then calculate how many square inches of mosaic he can create with those chips. Finally, we will use the height of the mosaic to find the length.

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips:**
   Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag contains 72 chips.
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine the total area of the mosaic:**
   It takes 12 glass chips to make 1 square inch of mosaic.
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the length of the mosaic:**
   The mosaic is 3 inches tall. To find the length, we divide the total area by the height.
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To determine the initial amount of tea in gallons at the beginning of the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. Add the amounts of tea consumed by both groups of students:
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
   \]

4. Add the remaining 10 quarts of tea to the total amount consumed to find the initial amount of tea:
   \[
   38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
   \]

5. Convert the total quarts to gallons (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts):
   \[
   48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

"To determine the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern described in the problem. The number of students doubles at the end of each month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year.

Let's break down the growth month by month:

1. **Initial number of students (beginning of January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

By the end of May, there are 320 students on campus. To find the number of additional students who joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310.

"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed in the week:**
   - Felix charges $0.25 per branch.
   - He made $105 in total.
   - Therefore, the total number of branches climbed is:
     \[
     \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The average number of branches climbed per day is:
     \[
     \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches}
     \]

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60.

   - For the first 3 flowers, each with 5 petals:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the next 4 flowers, each with 6 petals:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the next 5 flowers, each with 4 petals:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the last 6 flowers, each with 7 petals:
     \[
     6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Sum the total number of petals before any flowers are dropped:**
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **Subtract the petals of the flowers that were dropped:**
   - 1 flower with 5 petals:
     \[
     5 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - 1 flower with 6 petals:
     \[
     6 \text{ petals}

"To solve this problem, we need to account for the total number of marshmallows used and lost, and then determine how many are left for making additional S'mores.

1. **Total marshmallows in the bag**: 35
2. **Marshmallows used by John**: 9
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean**: 9
4. **Marshmallows dropped on the ground**: 3

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

Next, subtract this total from the initial number of marshmallows to find out how many are left:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends at the arcade, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses over the 4-hour period and then convert that into dollars.

First, let's establish the play time per quarter for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.

Next, we calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we sum the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \( 24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information. Let \( z \) represent the amount of citrus zest in ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 10z = 10 \]
Solving for \( z \), we find:
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \] ounces.

"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats at $500 each.
- The total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows at $1500 each.
- The total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Finally, we add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

"Given that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can determine the initial number of cars Joe has:

\[ \text{Joe's initial cars} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ \text{Cars sold} = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:

\[ \text{Cars given away} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars sold and given away from his initial number of cars:

\[ \text{Cars remaining} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and how the number of animals affects the total travel time.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to express the relationships between the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.

Let's denote:
- \( K \) as the number of dishes Kora made.
- \( R \) as the number of dishes Rory made.
- \( J \) as the number of dishes Jada made.

From the problem, we know:
1. Kora made 20 dishes, so \( K = 20 \).
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so \( R = K + 20 \).
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so \( J = 2R \).

First, substitute \( K = 20 \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[
R = 20 + 20 = 40
\]

Next, substitute \( R = 40 \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[
J = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

Now, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[
J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[
140

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all the sources of her funds and the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the new cost to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom has given her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let \( x \) represent the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine the number of apple slices left after Adam eats, we first calculate the total number of slices from both large and small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Adam slices 3 large apples and 5 small apples.

The total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the current daily milk production:
   - The farmer has 3 cows.
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - Total current production: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.

2. Determine the additional milk needed to reach the target:
   - The target production is 25 liters a day.
   - Additional milk needed: \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters a day.

3. Calculate the number of additional cows required:
   - Each cow produces 5 liters a day.
   - Number of additional cows needed: \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each partially used glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) of its original length left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its original length left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) of its original length left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Next, we sum the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"To determine the number of groups that can perform at the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time, including the intermission.

First, let's break down the time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together gives the total time per group:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes/group} \]

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time required per group to find out how many groups can perform:

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we can model the spread of the infection using exponential growth. Initially, there are 10 infected people, and each infected person infects 6 others every day. This can be represented by the formula:

\[ I(t) = I_0 \times (1 + r)^t \]

where:
- \( I(t) \) is the number of infected people at time \( t \),
- \( I_0 \) is the initial number of infected people,
- \( r \) is the rate of infection per day,
- \( t \) is the number of days.

In this scenario:
- \( I_0 = 10 \),
- \( r = 6 \) (since each infected person infects 6 others),
- \( t = 3 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ I(3) = 10 \times (1 + 6)^3 \]
\[ I(3) = 10 \times 7^3 \]
\[ I(3) = 10 \times 343 \]
\[ I(3) = 3430 \]

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is:

"To determine the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we start by calculating the amount Rafaela received. Given that each of the forty customers tipped her $20, we can calculate her total tips as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to calculate the amount Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total tips:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta is:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to break down her total earnings and the contributions from mowing lawns.

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha's total earnings last month: $80.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume the total payment of $6 is for all the work done.
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = $6.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $6.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $6 = $74.

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of notebooks Martha had. Given that after buying 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of notebooks Martha had} + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for the initial number of notebooks:

\[ \text{Initial number of notebooks Martha had} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, the number of notebooks Joseph had is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Thus, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup available:**
   - The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Calculate the amount of soup used for dinner:**
   - Calvin and his wife are adults, and each will have one adult bowl.
   - Therefore, 2 adult bowls will be used for dinner.
   - Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to \(2 \times 2 = 4\) child bowls.

3. **Calculate the remaining soup after dinner:**
   - The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup.
   - After using 4 child bowls for dinner, the remaining soup is \(8 - 4 = 4\) child bowls.

4. **Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch:**
   - Calvin has two children.
   - The remaining 4 child bowls of soup can be divided among the two children.

"To calculate the total amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: the material required for the small masks and the material required for the large masks.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the total material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the total material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total Material Required:**
   - Adding the material required for both types of masks, we get:
   \[
   10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
   \]

Thus, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

   9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets}
   \]

2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket. The total amount spent is $216, so:
   \[
   \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket}
   \]

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

"To solve the problem, we first determine how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean has 30 marbles and gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. 

\[ \text{Marbles given to Jamie} = \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles given to Jamie and Donald from the total number of marbles Dean originally had:

\[ \text{Marbles left for Dean} = 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \(D\) and Adam's current age as \(A\).

From the problem, we know:
1. \(D = 60\)
2. \(D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)\)

Substituting \(D = 60\) into the second equation:
\[60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)\]
\[52 = 2 \times (A - 4)\]
\[52 = 2A - 8\]
\[60 = 2A\]
\[A = 30\]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38\]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

     \[
     50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine his hourly earnings:**
   - Colby earns $0.20 for each package.
   - His hourly earnings are:
     \[
     40 \text{ packages per hour} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per package} = 8 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate his total earnings for an eight-hour workday:**
   - Colby works 8 hours a day.
   - His total earnings for the day are:
     \[

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equations:
1. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2r \).
2. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 3y \).
3. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

Given \( r = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation for the total pieces of bologna:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

Substituting \( r = 20 \):
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Next, solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is:

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires in a 30-day month, we start by calculating the total distance driven. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day for 30 days, the total distance is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by the interval for tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine the amount of allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total expenditure and then divide it by 2, as they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

- A mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = \(600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200\) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = \(450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150\) calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = \(200 \times 200 = 40,000\) calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = \(300 \times 150 = 45,000\) calories.

Finally, let's sum the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories = \(40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000\) calories.

"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Next, we sum these values to find the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's break it down step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5):

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to sum the quantities of the other toys and then subtract this sum from the total number of toys after the bouncy balls were added.

The quantities of the toys are as follows:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we calculate the total number of toys before the bouncy balls were added:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we know that the total number of toys after adding the bouncy balls is 62. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the initial total from the final total:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine the number of new tables needed for the yard sale, we first calculate the total number of boxes available. There are 10 people, each donating 5 boxes, and the charity group already has 10 boxes. 

The total number of boxes donated by the 10 people is:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes already owned by the charity group:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can hold 2 boxes, so the total number of tables required to fit all 60 boxes is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours. The hotel offers two options: a 12-hour stay for 1000 pesos or a 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos. After the initial 12 hours, the hotel charges an additional 70 pesos per hour.

First, let's calculate the cost for the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for an additional 5 hours (17 hours total - 12 hours).

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, let's compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay:
- The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we can break down the problem into two parts: the hay required for the goats and the hay required for the sheep.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

Therefore, Nate needs a total of 159 pounds of hay.

"John's total earnings for the week are calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

After spending 50 dollars on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

After depositing 100 dollars in the bank:
\[ \text{Remaining} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

The cost of 5 pencils at 10 dollars each:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

After buying the pencils:
\[ \text{Remaining} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

The number of 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From equation 2:
\[ A = B - 20 \]

From equation 3:
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Next, substitute these expressions into the total points equation (equation 1):

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring cups as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, given the initial conditions and the rate of patient admissions.

1. **Initial Occupied Beds:**
   The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are initially occupied.
   \[
   \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
   \]

2. **Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks:**
   The hospital admits 50 patients each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700
   \]

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the sum of the initial occupied beds and the patients admitted:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900
   \]

4. **Unoccupied Beds:**
   The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity of the hospital minus the total number of occupied beds:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. If Kelly is correct, Courtney's reported number of 48 people is 20% more than the actual number.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to the problem, Courtney's reported number is 1.2 times the actual number:

\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:

"Given the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried, \( x \) represent the number of balls Jason carried, and \( 2x \) represent the number of balls Jordan carried. According to the problem:

1. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey: \( x = 2J \)
2. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason: \( 2x \)

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( x = 2 \).

Using the first equation, we can find the number of balls Jeffrey carried:
\[ J = \frac{x}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Now, we can find the number of balls Jordan carried:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

The total number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey is:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( A \).

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. We can break down the journey into three segments and then sum the net distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta initially had.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to individual brownies, knowing that 1 dozen equals 12 brownies:

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Next, we sum up all the brownies she had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Then, we need to subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

So, the number of brownies left over is:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

   - Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy is 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

\(\boxed{162}\)"
"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzels} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels the brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzels} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

"To determine the total cost Katherine will incur for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to break down the costs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket will contain 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- The cost of one petunia is $3.00.
- The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$5.00 \]

The total cost for one basket:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00/\text{basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\boxed{70}\) dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then see how much soil remains for the roses.

First, let's calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's calculate the soil used for the carnations:
- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's find the total soil used for both sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To determine how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly amount Jessica sets aside for shoes.
2. Determine the annual amount set aside for shoes.
3. Calculate the number of pairs of shoes she can buy with the annual amount.

First, we calculate the monthly amount Jessica sets aside for shoes:
\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we calculate the annual amount set aside for shoes:
\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Finally, we determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the annual amount:
\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00 \text{ per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the process into two main steps: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find the time required to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Rate of peeling}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find the time required to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine the number of batches needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per batch}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Time per batch} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both peeling and cooking is the sum of the time for each step:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To determine the final temperature change, we can break down the problem into three distinct phases and calculate the temperature change for each phase:

1. **Cooling on Low for 3 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature change is \( 2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees} \).

2. **Cooling on High for 4 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature change is \( 3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees} \).

3. **Warming Up for 2 Hours with No Air Conditioner:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature change is \( 2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees} \).

Next, we sum the temperature changes from each phase to find the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \( 6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees} \).
- Total warming: \( 4 \, \text{degrees} \).

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees} \).

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley has an orbital period of 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check he writes:

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this results in:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks per month to the church. Therefore, the total number of checks per year is:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check per quarter for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:
     \[
     F = 2 \times 44 = 88
     \]

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, the number of flights to Greece is:
     \[
     \text{Flights to Greece} = \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66
     \]
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The number of remaining flights is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining flights} = 88 - 66 = 22
     \]
   - Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to each country is:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{22}{2} = 11
     \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The cost of the trousers is $30.
5. The amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute **12** dollars from his savings."
"To determine Wilfred's age, we start by using the given information:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is given by:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. Given that there were 100 guests and each guest brought 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can determine the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we can set up a simple ratio based on the given conditions. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult's slice is twice as large as each kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is:
- 4 kids, each with a slice of \( x \)
- 2 adults, each with a slice of \( 2x \)

Thus, the total watermelon can be expressed as:
\[ 4x + 2 \times 2x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company provided a conversion factor of 5.9 gallons per cubic foot. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
   \[
   G = V \times 5.9
   \]
   \[
   G = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Thus, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = G \times 0.10

"To determine how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

1. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, accounting for the rate of discharge over time.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge After 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

58.9%"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   Janet earns $10 per hour from her wages and $15 per hour from tips.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   Janet works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. The prices and quantities are as follows:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits already purchased:

\[
1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25
\]

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount he has is:

\[
10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75
\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

\[
0.75 / 0.25 = 3
\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne had initially. Given that the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces she gave away is the total number of pieces minus the pieces she kept:

\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

She distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend received:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the growth factor:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this growth factor to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time James spends reading 18 pages, given his reading rate.

First, we establish James's reading rate:
- James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes.
- Therefore, his reading rate is \( \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages:
- Using the reading rate, the time required to read 18 pages is \( \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} \).

Performing the calculation:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18}{0.3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of guests at the hotel throughout the day. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. **Early checkouts**: 24 guests check out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]
3. **Late checkouts**: 15 guests check out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]
4. **Afternoon check-ins**: Twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests check in}
   \]
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests now at the hotel}
   \]
5. **Evening check-ins**: 7 more people check in after dinner.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( S \) represent the price of a small stuffed animal and \( L \) represent the price of a large stuffed animal. We are given that \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Thus, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, given that each dwarf uses a steel pickaxe.

1. **Determine the daily mining rate for one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the mining rate doubles: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the mining rate is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily mining rate for 40 dwarves:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, then 40 dwarves can mine: \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total mining rate for 30 days:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then in 30 days they can mine: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the principle of proportionality. Given that the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich should be consistent across all package sizes.

Let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the cost per sandwich is consistent at $1.5, we can use this to find the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:
\[
8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their respective probabilities. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Probability of a Substitute Teacher:**
   - There is a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
   - Probability: \( P(\text{Substitute}) = 0.50 \)

2. **Probability of the Normal Teacher Giving an Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
   - Probability: \( P(\text{Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.40 \)
   - Combined probability: \( P(\text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20 \)

3. **Probability of Marcus Getting a Personal Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
   - Probability: \( P(\text{No Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) = 0.60 \)
   - Probability of getting a personal extension: \( P(\text{Personal Extension} \mid \text{No Extension}) = 0.20 \)
   - Combined probability: \( P(\text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{No Extension} \mid \text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{Personal Extension} \mid \text{No Extension}) = 0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06 \)

Now, we sum the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: \( 0.50 \)
- Normal teacher gives an extension: \( 0.20 \)
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: \( 0.06 \)

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76 \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

"To solve the problem of determining the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs for his king-sized bed, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. We can use the formula for exponential decay to find the price:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price of the car after \( t \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we can break down the problem into a few straightforward steps:

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Given that he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   Add the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since 100 cents equal 1 dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[
245

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring produces one jellyfish per second.

First, let's convert the time from hours to seconds:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14,400 seconds

Next, we calculate the number of jellyfish produced by one spring in 14,400 seconds:
- Since one spring produces 1 jellyfish per second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will produce 14,400 jellyfish.

Now, we need to find the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs:
- If one spring produces 14,400 jellyfish, then 5 springs will produce 5 * 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000.

"To determine the earnings of the apple orchard, we can use a simple calculation based on the number of apples sold and the price per bag. 

Given:
- Each bag contains 10 apples.
- The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples.
- Each bag is sold for $5.

First, we calculate the number of bags sold:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about the sequence of events and the final amount of meat left.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat remaining.
2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate represents the remaining half after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the velociraptors scavenged, there were:
   \[
   270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
   \]
3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex ate represents the remaining half of the triceratops. This means that before the T-Rex ate, the total weight of the triceratops was:
   \[
   540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}

1. **Calculate the area of the walls:**
   - The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     \[
     \text{Area of one north/south wall} = 10 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
     \]
     Since there are two such walls:
     \[
     \text{Total area of north and south walls} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
     \]

   - The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     \[
     \text{Area of one east/west wall} = 5 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} = 40 \, \text{square feet}
     \]
     Since there are two such walls:
     \[
     \text{Total area of east and west walls} = 2 \times 40 \, \text{square feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total area of all four walls:**
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 160 \, \text{square feet} + 80 \, \text{square feet} = 240 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
     \[
     \text{Number of gallons needed} = \frac{240 \, \text{square feet}}{20 \, \text{square feet per gallon}} = 12 \, \text{gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
   - The cost per gallon is $12.
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 12 \, \text{gallons} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per gallon} = 144 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\) dollars."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Total sodas: 12
   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 9

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen took 1 unshaken soda.
   - Remaining sodas: 11
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**

"To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances, as they are moving in opposite directions.

1. The first train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.

We can use the formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the first train:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second train:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we start by understanding the given information: 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. We can use this information to find the total number of students in the school.

Let \( T \) represent the total number of students in the school. According to the problem, 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum the weights of all the dogs:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using algebraic reasoning.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64
   \]

Thus, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days it will take for Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the Earth.

1. **Determine the distance for half the circumference of the Earth:**
   The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half the circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of days required:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day. To find out how many days it will take to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To solve the problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. We know that Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Therefore, the equation for the total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is:
     \[
     S + (S + 12) = 30
     \]

3. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2S + 12 = 30
     \]
   - Subtract 12 from both sides:
     \[
     2S = 18
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     S = 9
     \]

4. **Number of eggs Camden painted:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

6. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.
   - Therefore, the equation for the total eggs painted by all four is:
     \[
     2A + 30 = 56
     \]

7. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2A = 26
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     A = 13
     \]

8. **Number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a series of steps:

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To determine the total time Grandma spends on her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the problem into the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk, considering the different speeds.

1. **Calculate the speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Calculate the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, given that she has already saved $4 every week for the past 8 weeks.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can determine the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we start by translating the given information into a mathematical equation. We know that Bob will have 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has. The equation can be written as:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we can use the principle of heat transfer and the concept of weighted averages. When two different temperatures of water are mixed, the final temperature is a weighted average of the initial temperatures, where the weights are the volumes of the water.

Given:
- The temperature of the first mug of water, \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees.
- The volume of water from the first mug, \( V_1 = 4 \) ounces.
- The volume of water from the second mug, \( V_2 = 1 \) ounce.
- The final temperature of the mixed water, \( T_f \geq 40 \) degrees.

We need to find the minimum temperature \( T_2 \) of the water in the second mug.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{V_1 \cdot T_1 + V_2 \cdot T_2}{V_1 + V_2} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 40 \leq \frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{4 + 1} \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 40 \leq \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:
\[ 200 \leq 132 + T_2 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):
\[ 68 \leq T_2 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the 21 days and then add these to the initial numbers.

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two main parts: determining the number of scoops Gomer ate and then calculating the number of potatoes required for those scoops.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \)
   - Therefore, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes required for 18 scoops:**
   - The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation for the number of potatoes: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
   - Calculation for the number of scoops: \( 3 - 1 = 2 \)
   - So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Set up the proportion to find the number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - We need to find out how many potatoes (\( x \)) are needed for 18 scoops.
   - Proportion: \( \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{54}{2} = 27

"To determine the average speed of Sid's travel, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then use these to find the average speed.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Sid traveled 110 miles in the first part of the journey.
   - Sid traveled an additional 140 miles in the second part of the journey.
   - Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Sid traveled for 2 hours in the first part of the journey.
   - Sid traveled for an additional 3 hours in the second part of the journey.
   - Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed is given by the formula: \(\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}\).
   - Substituting the values, we get: \(\text{Average speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}\).

Therefore, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to calculate the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then find the joint probability of both events occurring.

1. The probability that the first lottery ticket wins is given as 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket wins is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. The joint probability that both tickets win is the product of their individual probabilities:
   \[
   0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   0.12 \times 100 = 12\%

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the annual fruit production for each year from age 5 to age 10 and then sum these values.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits (no production).
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the initial amounts of money that Ronnie and Rissa have. Ronnie is given $5, and Rissa is given three times as much, which is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money each of them gives to their little sister. Let \( x \) be the amount of money each gives to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount of money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gives $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

"Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills from the bank. First, we calculate the number of $20 bills he initially has:
\[
\text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills:
\[
\text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
\]

He then uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill:
\[
\text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]
\[
\text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

The value of the remaining $20 bills is:
\[
\text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
\]

Thomas then triples this amount:
\[
\text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
\]

Finally, he converts the $1200 into $5 bills:
\[
\text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth that are either drilled or capped and then find what percentage this total represents of all his teeth.

1. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.
3. The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped: \(4 + 11 = 15\) teeth.
4. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her friends and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices/friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices/friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- The number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
\[3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation:**
   - The net number of snowballs Jay can accumulate in one hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Time to Accumulate 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to accumulate 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of accumulation:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To determine Jim's current age, we can use the information provided and set up a simple algebraic equation. 

Given:
- John is currently 28 years old.
- 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.

First, let's find John's age 20 years ago:
\[ \text{John's age 20 years ago} = 28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Let \( J \) represent Jim's age 20 years ago. According to the problem, John's age 20 years ago was twice Jim's age at that time:
\[ 8 = 2J \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago:
\[ \text{Jim's current age} = 4 + 20 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, Jim is currently 24 years old.

"To determine the distance the last dog needs to walk, we can use the concept of the arithmetic mean. The average distance walked by the four dogs is given as 3 miles per day. This means the total distance walked by all four dogs combined is:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Average distance} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We are given the distances walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

The total distance walked by these three dogs is:

\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance walked by the last dog, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:

\[ \text{Distance walked by the last dog} = 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow a series of calculations based on the given information:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by jelly beans.
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Determine the difference between the true number and Tim's estimate:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Thus, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine the number of novels Regina has written this year, we can use the information that 9 novels represent 3/4 of the total number of novels she has written this year. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

To solve for the number of novels this year, we need to isolate the variable. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 12 \]

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes and \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
   \[
   B = 5S - 4
   \]
2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   \[
   S + B = 116
   \]

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
S + (5S - 4) = 116
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
S + 5S - 4 = 116
\]
\[
6S - 4 = 116
\]
\[
6S = 120
\]
\[
S = 20

"To determine the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to sum the time taken for each side. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To determine the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then sum them up.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the following 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is halved compared to the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels.

Summing these values gives the total number of pieces of popcorn:

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim will need, we can break down the problem into two parts: the lemons needed for the pool party and the lemons needed for Allen's extra gallon of lemonade.

1. **Lemons for the Pool Party:**
   - Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice needed for the pool party is:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice, the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}
     \]

2. **Lemons for Allen's Extra Gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the regular lemonade.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the number of lemons needed for 2 cups of lemon juice is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}
     \]

3. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - Adding the lemons needed for the pool party and Allen's extra gallon:
     \[
     24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}
     \]

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"To determine the total amount of dog food required for a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption for each type of dog and then extend that to a weekly total.

1. **Daily Consumption Calculation:**
   - **German Shepherds:**
     - Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
     - There are 3 German Shepherds.
     - Total daily consumption for German Shepherds = \( 5 \, \text{kg/dog/day} \times 3 \, \text{dogs} = 15 \, \text{kg/day} \).

   - **Bulldogs:**
     - Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
     - There are 2 Bulldogs.
     - Total daily consumption for Bulldogs = \( 3 \, \text{kg/dog/day} \times 2 \, \text{dogs} = 6 \, \text{kg/day} \).

2. **Total Daily Consumption:**
   - Total daily consumption for all dogs = \( 15 \, \text{kg/day} \, (\text{German Shepherds}) + 6 \, \text{kg/day} \, (\text{Bulldogs}) = 21 \, \text{kg/day} \).

3. **Weekly Consumption Calculation:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total weekly consumption = \( 21 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 147 \, \text{kg} \).

Therefore, the kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red blocks in the tower. We know the following:

- The tower is made up of 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

First, let's calculate the number of yellow blocks:
\[
\text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue blocks} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

Next, we add the number of blue and yellow blocks to find the total number of these blocks:
\[
\text{Total number of blue and yellow blocks} = 4 + 8 = 12
\]

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:

\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

He then spends money on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 cones is:
\[ 4 \, \text{cones} \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars/cone} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings, Ryan has:
\[ 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of one ticket:
\[ \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}} = 2 \, \text{tickets} \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation and then determine how long it will take Nate to fill in all the holes, considering the dog continues to dig new holes each night.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Over 14 days, the total number of holes is:
     \[
     6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
     \]

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - The net number of holes filled each day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of days required to fill in all the holes:**
   - With 84 holes to fill and a net rate of 3 holes per day, the number of days required is:
     \[
     \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so:
     \[
     \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
     \]

"To determine how many beakers Igor lost, we can set up an equation based on the information provided:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers, but he lost some

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the 4 tables and then determine how many screws will be left over from the 40 screws James has.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg requires 2 screws.
3. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws will be left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, let's calculate Aaron's speed:
- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

Next, we determine Vanessa's speed:
- Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
- Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm, we can use a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
