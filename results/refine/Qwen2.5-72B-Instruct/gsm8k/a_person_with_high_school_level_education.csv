"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. 

Next, Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. So, she uses a total of:
3 + 4 = 7 eggs

This means the number of eggs left for her to sell is:
16 - 7 = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
9 * 2 = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To figure out how many bolts of fiber are needed for a robe, let's break it down:

- The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It also needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So, half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts of blue fiber} + 1 \text{ bolt of white fiber} = 3 \text{ bolts in total} \]

So, the total number of bolts needed is:
3"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total Cost:**
   - Josh bought the house for $80,000.
   - He spent $50,000 on repairs.
   - So, the total cost is:
     \[
     80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
     \]

2. **New Value of the House:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - 150% of $80,000 is:
     \[
     1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     \]
   - So, the new value of the house is:
     \[
     80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
     \]

3. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
     \[
     200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
     \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

\[
\boxed{70000}

"James runs 3 sprints each time he goes out, and he does this 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. To find out how many meters he runs in a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

So, it's 3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week.

That gives us 540 meters a week.

"To figure out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, let's find out how much feed all the chickens need in a day:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- Wendi has 20 chickens.
- So, the total feed needed for all chickens in a day is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's add up the feed Wendi has already given:
- In the morning, she gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups.
- So, the total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Now, we need to find out how much more feed is needed for the final meal:
- Total feed needed for the day: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To figure out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, where every second glass is 60% of the regular price, we can break it down step by step.

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- For 16 glasses, there are 8 pairs of glasses.
- In each pair, the first glass costs $5 and the second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

Now, let's add up the total number of sheep in all three cities:
- Seattle: 20 sheep
- Charleston: 80 sheep
- Toulouse: 160 sheep

Total number of sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
260"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to figure out how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart. The file is 200 GB, and she downloads 40% of it before the restart.
   \[ 200 \text{ GB} \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

2. Next, we need to find out how long it takes to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB per minute.
   \[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

3. After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.
   \[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

4. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, we need to add the time it takes to download the full 200 GB file again.
   \[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

5. Finally, we add the time for the partial download, the restart, and the full download:
   \[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes to download the file is:
160"
"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find out how far he goes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance he travels is:

\[ 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. During this time, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move at all during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph. The distance he covers in this time is:

\[ 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is:

\[ 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:

\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how far he is from home, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

45"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Eliza earned this week. 

First, we need to calculate her regular pay. Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours. So, for 40 hours, her pay is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we need to calculate her overtime pay. Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12 \text{ per hour} \]

For 5 hours of overtime, her pay is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \boxed{460} \]"
"To figure out the total number of downloads over the three months, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - So, \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) downloads.

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, find 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Then, subtract this from 180: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \) downloads.

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - Add up the downloads from all three months: \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To figure out the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then add them all up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, the cost for the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add up the costs for all the pastries:
- Total cost = $204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes)
- Total cost = $694

The total cost is $694.

694"
"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to look at the costs and the income he gets each year.

First, let's break down the costs and earnings:
- The tree costs $90 to plant.
- Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5.
- It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

Now, let's calculate the annual profit:
- Revenue from lemons each year: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
- Cost to water and feed the tree each year: $3
- Net profit each year: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) at the green house.

2. **Vacuum cleaners left after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

4. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

5. **Vacuum cleaners left after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left. We know this is 5 vacuum cleaners.

So, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

6. **Solve the equation:**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the dance class:** 20

2. **Students enrolled in contemporary dance:**
   - 20% of 20 students = \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) students

3. **Remaining students after contemporary dance:**
   - 20 students - 4 students = 16 students

4. **Students enrolled in jazz dance:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students = \( 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \) students

5. **Remaining students after jazz dance:**
   - 16 students - 4 students = 12 students

6. **Students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - 12 students

7. **Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - \( \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \)

So, the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance is:
60%"
"To figure out which option will make the most money, we need to calculate the profit for each choice based on the market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - The jewelry costs $5,000.
   - The market is expected to go up by 2.5%.
   - To find the profit, we calculate 2.5% of $5,000:
     \[
     5000 \times 0.025 = 125
     \]
   - So, the profit from jewelry is $125.

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - The electronic gadgets cost $8,000.
   - The market is expected to go up by 1.2%.
   - To find the profit, we calculate 1.2% of $8,000:
     \[
     8000 \times 0.012 = 96
     \]
   - So, the profit from electronic gadgets is $96.

Comparing the two profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to make the most money.

The maximum profit is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to find out Jill's annual salary.

1. **Calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:**
   - Jill teaches for 35 hours a week.
   - She gets paid $20 per hour.
   - So, her weekly earnings from teaching = 35 hours * $20/hour = $700.

2. **Calculate her weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching:**
   - Jill coaches for 15 hours a week.
   - She gets paid $30 per hour.
   - So, her weekly earnings from coaching = 15 hours * $30/hour = $450.

3. **Calculate her total weekly earnings:**
   - Total weekly earnings = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
   - Total weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150.

4. **Calculate her annual salary:**
   - Jill works 50 weeks a year.
   - Annual salary = Total weekly earnings * 50 weeks
   - Annual salary = $1150 * 50 = $57,500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

57500"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
3. We need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks, so 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she uses: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, and then another hour to walk the next 2 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we need to figure out how fast she needs to walk the remaining distance.

First, let's find out how much time she has left to complete the trail. If she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the whole 12 miles, she needs to finish the trail in:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, she needs to complete the trail in 3 hours. She has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. This means she has:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. The problem says that two-thirds of the orange drink is water. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

But we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so we only have 9 liters left. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The problem says that three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we mix the remaining 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total volume of the mixture is:

\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:

\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Samantha is 31 years old now.
2. Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so Raymond is:
   \[ 31 + 6 = 37 \] years old.
3. Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old.
4. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age:
   \[ 37 - 23 = 14 \]

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday. Here's the breakdown of what each group of customers bought:

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD. So, \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs. So, \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs. So, \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:

\[3 + 4 + 0 = 7\]

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Kyle bought the book for $19.50, which is after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price. 

To find the original price, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.75 \times \text{original price} = 19.50 \]

Now, we need to solve for the original price. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ \text{original price} = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Let's do the division:
\[ \text{original price} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

26.00"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Marie spent on everything except the pizza.

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- Each pack of milk costs $3, and she bought 5 packs, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Each apple costs $1.50, and she bought 4 apples, so that's \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount she spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\].

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

2"
"To figure out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing, we need to add up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes. 

First, let's calculate the cost for each type of clothing:
- Shorts: 3 pairs at $16.50 each
  \[
  3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
  \]
- Pants: 3 pairs at $22.50 each
  \[
  3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
  \]
- Shoes: 3 pairs at $42.00 each
  \[
  3 \times 42.00 = 126.00
  \]

Next, we add up the total costs:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00 = 243.00
\]

So, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items.

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. She buys cartons of ice cream that have 15 servings each, and each carton costs $4.00. To find out how much she will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we figure out how many servings she will eat in 60 days:
\[ 1 \text{ serving/night} \times 60 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we determine how many cartons she will need. Since each carton has 15 servings:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 4 cartons:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Henry's first stop was after he had traveled 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. So, to find out where his second stop was, we subtract 15 miles from the total 60 miles:
   \[
   60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles}
   \]
   This means his second stop was at the 45-mile mark.

3. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
   \[
   45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Gloria is looking at a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much as the first pair.

First, let's find out how much the second pair of heels costs:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, let's add the costs of both pairs of heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the two pairs of heels together cost $99. According to the problem, this is $5 less than the cost of the boots. We can set up the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots (\( B \)), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means that for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts.
2. Let's say Darrell's age is \(7x\) and Allen's age is \(11x\).
3. The total of their ages is given as 162. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
4. Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
5. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
6. Now, we can find their current ages:
   - Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
   - Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)
7. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is:

"To figure out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to do a bit of math. 

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of. John has 10 dogs, so we multiply the time per dog by the number of dogs:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily hours by 7:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's use some algebra to figure out how many gold coins she has.

1. Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \).
2. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

We also know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ S + S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. The problem says that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Raymond has 40 jewels, so half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Now, Aaron has 5 more than this, so:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem says that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

First, let's figure out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes. 

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, let's add the points from both periods:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
9"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   - Over 30 days, he eats: \( 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \).

2. **Determine the cost per yogurt:**
   - The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - So, the cost per yogurt is: \( \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**
   - The total cost for 60 yogurts is: \( 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John starts with 13 lego sets. He sells each set for $15, so he makes 13 * 15 = $195. He then buys 8 video games, each costing $20, which totals 8 * 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. Since he has $5 left after all transactions, it means he spent $30 on something else or there's a discrepancy, but the question focuses on the lego sets. Since he sold all his lego sets, he has 0 lego sets left.

"To figure out how fast John runs, we need to find his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance he runs by the total time he spends running.

First, let's add up the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half of 3 hours, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

10"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - So, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - So, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \(6 \div 3 = 2\) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \(6\) miles per hour × \(2\) hours = \(12\) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \(1.5\) miles per hour × \(4\) hours = \(6\) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \(12\) miles + \(6\) miles = \(18\) miles.

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Polly's Normal Throwing Distance**: Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet.
2. **Effect of the Sapphire Gemstone**: When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal distance.
3. **New Throwing Distance with Gemstone**: 
   \[
   400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. **Dragon's Flame Reach**: The dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet.
5. **Distance Outside Dragon's Reach**: To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the new throwing distance:
   \[
   1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"Grandma Jones made 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so there were a total of:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, 14 pieces were left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, the total number of calories in the bag is:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still eat today without going over your daily limit. You have a daily target of 2000 calories, and you've already eaten 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can eat are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many grams of chips 200 calories would be. The whole bag is 300 grams and has 1250 calories. To find out how many grams are in 200 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{300 \text{ grams} \times 200 \text{ calories}}{1250 \text{ calories}} \]

\[ x = \frac{60000}{1250} \]

\[ x = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To figure out Charlie's net profit, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of beeswax needed:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs \( \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of beeswax and wicks:**
   - One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00.
   - For 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - For 20 candles, the total revenue is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = \( 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Charlie's net profit is:

"Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics. She spends 4 hours on each article, from research to writing. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. We need to find out how many hours she spent writing articles over these three days.

First, let's figure out how many articles she wrote each day:

- **Monday:** She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, she wrote \(5 + (5 \times \frac{2}{5}) = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles.
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote \(7 \times 2 = 14\) articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
- Total articles: \(5 + 7 + 14 = 26\)

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
- Total hours: \(26 \times 4 = 104\)

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. She bought a package of Post-it notes, but we don't know how many were in the package yet. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes.
4. After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 left.

First, we need to find out how many Post-it notes she had before using them. We know she had 23 left after using 220, so:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]
This means she had 243 Post-it notes before using any.

Now, we know she started with 80 Post-it notes and bought a package with \( x \) Post-it notes. So:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. Let's figure out how much he spent on ties in total.

First, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200, we can calculate the number of blue ties like this:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. So, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, John spent a total of $800 on ties.

\[
\boxed{800}

"To figure out how many pieces Tracy got, we need to first convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces she got.

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many units are in the whole building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we can multiply these numbers together:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. The problem says that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week and his chickens produce 252 eggs each day, we can calculate the total number of eggs produced in a week:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Next, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens

Now, we know that Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

147 dozens * $2/dozen = $294

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

1. **Calculate the distance Tom travels:**
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is 3 hours.
   - To find the distance, we use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time.
   - So, Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Calculate the time to travel back:**
   - Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.
   - The distance to travel back is the same, 30 miles.
   - To find the time, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.
   - So, Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"Alright, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much weight Uriah removes by taking out 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Uriah has already removed 7.5 pounds by taking out the comic books. He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so he still needs to remove:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many toys he needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so:
\[ \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To figure out how much more the mechanic made on the day he earned the most, we need to calculate the total money he made on both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- He fixed 6 truck tires at $60 each.
- So, for truck tires: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- He also fixed 4 car tires at $40 each.
- So, for car tires: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Total for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

**Friday:**
- He fixed 12 car tires at $40 each.
- So, for car tires: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- Total for Friday: \(480\) dollars.

Now, we compare the totals:
- Thursday: 520 dollars
- Friday: 480 dollars

The difference in revenue between the two days is:
- \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

So, the mechanic made $40 more on Thursday.

3. Trixie, the other house cat, had 12 kittens.

Now, we need to add all these kittens together:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Patchy's kittens: 21

"To figure out how many boxes the truck can carry without going over the bridge's weight limit, we need to do a few calculations. Here’s how we can solve it step by step:

1. **Find the total weight limit of the bridge:**
   - The bridge can carry up to 5000 pounds.

2. **Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   - The driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds.
   - So, the remaining weight capacity for the boxes is \( 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \) pounds.

3. **Determine the weight of each box:**
   - Each box weighs 15 pounds.

4. **Calculate the maximum number of boxes:**
   - To find out how many boxes can fit within the remaining weight capacity, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Marcy gets a full pension of $50,000 per year if she works for 40 years. But if she quits after 30 years, she gets a smaller amount. Here's how it works:

1. For the first 20 years, she doesn't get any extra benefits.
2. After 20 years, for each additional year she works, she gets 5% of the full pension.

So, if she works for 30 years, she works 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.

10 years * 5% = 50%

This means she gets 50% of the full pension.

Now, let's calculate 50% of $50,000:

50% of $50,000 = 0.50 * $50,000 = $25,000

So, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Aleena pays for the first half of the year. The streaming service charges her $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, we can calculate the total for the first half like this:

\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

So, Aleena pays $840 for the first half of the year.

Next, for the second half of the year, the streaming service charges her 10% less. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $140:

\[ 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \]

So, the monthly charge for the second half of the year is:

\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total for the second half of the year. There are also 6 months in the second half, so:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

So, Aleena pays $756 for the second half of the year.

Finally, to find the total amount she paid for the entire year, we add the amounts for both halves:

\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Time spent in one session:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
   - He then reads for half as long, which is 1 hour (since half of 2 hours is 1 hour).

   So, in one session, he spends:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Time spent in one week:**
   - Jim does this 3 times a week.
   - Therefore, in one week, he spends:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

3. **Time spent in 4 weeks:**
   - In 4 weeks, he spends:
   \[
   9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Each school has:
- A girls' basketball team with 5 players
- A boys' basketball team with 5 players
- A coach for the girls' team
- A coach for the boys' team

So, for each school, the total number of people is:
5 (girls' players) + 5 (boys' players) + 1 (girls' coach) + 1 (boys' coach) = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people per school by the number of schools:
12 people per school * 4 schools = 48 people

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48.

48"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Diamonds**: The problem says there are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: It also says there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, we subtract 35 from 175 to find the number of rubies:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: The problem states there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. So, we multiply the number of rubies by 2 to find the number of emeralds:
   \[
   140 \times 2 = 280
   \]

Now, we add up all the gems to get the total number:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 595
\]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is:
\[
595
\]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of Girls**: We know there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school.

2. **Number of Boys**: The problem states there are twice as many boys as girls. So, if there are 60 girls, then there are:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ boys}
   \]

3. **Total Number of Students**: To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls:
   \[
   60 \text{ girls} + 120 \text{ boys} = 180 \text{ students}
   \]

4. **Number of Teachers**: The problem also tells us that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ students}}{5 \text{ students/teacher}} = 36 \text{ teachers}
   \]

So, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36.

"To figure out how much money Bailey started with, we need to think about the total amount she had at the end and subtract the money she got over the 8 weeks.

Bailey gets $5 each week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she gets from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has $100. This $100 includes the money she started with plus the $40 she got from her allowance. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the $40 from the $100:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

60"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how much Judy makes in one week.

First, we need to find out how many classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in all these classes:
- Each class has 15 students.
- So, the total number of students in a week is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Now, we need to calculate how much money Judy makes from these students:
- She charges $15.00 per student.
- So, the total money she makes is 495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00.

Therefore, Judy makes $7425.00 in one week.

"To figure out how much money Tommy raised, we need to do a couple of simple calculations. 

First, let's calculate the money from the brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie for $3.
- He sold 43 brownies.
- So, the money from brownies is 43 * 3 = $129.

Next, let's calculate the money from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each slice of cheesecake for $4.
- He sold 23 slices of cheesecake.
- So, the money from cheesecakes is 23 * 4 = $92.

Now, we add the money from the brownies and the cheesecakes to get the total amount raised:
- Total amount raised = $129 + $92 = $221.

So, Tommy raised $221.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Next, we calculate how much Artie makes from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 per pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 per pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 per pot = $34

Finally, we add up the total revenue:
- Total revenue = $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

So, Artie will make $88.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it. The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.

1. **4th Level:** 16 square feet
2. **3rd Level:** Since the 3rd level is twice the size of the 4th level, it's \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) square feet.
3. **2nd Level:** The 2nd level is twice the size of the 3rd level, so it's \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) square feet.
4. **1st Level:** The 1st level is twice the size of the 2nd level, so it's \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \) square feet.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all the levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is:

"To figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days of the year.

For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of food each day. So, we calculate:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the next 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of food each day. So, we calculate:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of dog food needed for the year:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much laundry David does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 4:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, to find out how much laundry Raymond does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 2:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:

"To figure out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in two different ways: in packages of 3 for $2.50 each and in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package has 3 flowers, so for 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Each package costs $2.50, so 6 packages cost \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package has 2 flowers, so for 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Each package costs $1, so 9 packages cost \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Buying in packages of 3 costs $15.
- Buying in packages of 2 costs $9.

The savings by buying in packages of 2 is:
\[ 15 - 9 = 6 \] dollars.

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much water the two girls got. Each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters per girl} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

We started with 24 liters of water. To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total amount taken from the initial amount:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water left is:

10 liters"

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

The team played 22 games in total. We know they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's use some simple algebra to solve this.

Let's say:
- \( W \) is the number of games they won.
- \( L \) is the number of games they lost.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of games is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. They won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \):

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \):

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: Sylvie starts with a monthly salary of $600.
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: To find her initial annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12:
   \[
   600 \times 12 = 7200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Salary Increase After 5 Years**: After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% of her initial monthly salary. So, we calculate the increase:
   \[
   600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Adding this to her initial monthly salary:
   \[
   600 + 60 = 660 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we find her new annual salary:
   \[
   660 \times 12 = 7920 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Salary After 3 More Years**: Since the salary increase only happens once after 5 years, her salary remains the same for the next 3 years. Therefore, her annual salary after 3 more years is still:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say Harald sold \( H \) copies of his record. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so she sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both of them is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to do a bit of math. 

First, let's calculate how much the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- So, the total for the adults is 10 pounds/adult * 20 adults = 200 pounds.

Next, let's calculate how much the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- So, the total for the children is 5 pounds/child * 5 children = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the amounts for the adults and the children to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad = 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

   - So, Gerald's original time is \(38 + 2 = 40\) seconds.

3. **Gerald's Improved Time:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means he can run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - To find 90% of 40 seconds, we calculate \(40 \times 0.90 = 36\) seconds.

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To figure out how many tomatoes Freda used, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes:**
   - Freda made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When tomatoes are cooked into sauce, they lose half their volume.
   - So, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Initial volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.
   - Number of cans used = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

3. **Convert the number of cans to the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Total number of tomatoes used = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. Then, 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, 5 cars take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially was 30, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many potted plants Mary has in total before she gives any away. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. So, we add these to the 80 plants she already has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Now, Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

58"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, we need to find 1/4 of 20 and add it to 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]
   So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell was pressed:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is:
175"
"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of pages Solo has to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Adding these up:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Solo has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day on average.

"To figure out how long it will take for the fog to cover the whole city, we need to use the information given about the fog's speed and the city's width.

The fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. The city is 42 miles wide.

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover one segment:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces. A quarter of 1000 is:

\[
\frac{1000}{4} = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, after Poppy places her pieces, there are:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces left}
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. A third of 750 is:

\[
\frac{750}{3} = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, after Poppy's mom places her pieces, there are:

\[
750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces left}

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first figure out the inner dimensions of one box. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The outer dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches
- Width: 6 inches
- Height: 4 inches

Subtracting 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions:
- Inner length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
- Inner width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
- Inner height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
- Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
- Inner volume = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches
- Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

Since we have 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
- Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3
- Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. Let's break down how much TV he watched each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Now, let's add up the time he watched TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

2. He baked 15 more cookies than he intended to. So, the number of cookies he intended to bake is:
   \[
   115 - 15 = 100 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. He wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. So, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
   \[
   \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ cookies}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much 10 gallons of gas cost without any cashback. The price per gallon is $3.00.
   - So, 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

2. Next, we need to calculate the cashback. The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon.
   - So, 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00 cashback

3. Finally, we subtract the cashback from the total cost to find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback.
   - $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, after the cashback, the gas will cost $28.00.

"Okay, let's figure out the average number of fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate.

First, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups each of them ate:

- Beatrice's roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate is:
  \[
  2 \times 24 = 48
  \]

- Marcell's roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate is:
  \[
  3 \times 14 = 42
  \]

Next, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both of them:
\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rowed in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how much water entered the boat. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water that entered the boat is:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on:

"To figure out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. There are 4 teachers in total.
3. So, the total number of lessons in a day is:
   \[
   4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons/day}
   \]
4. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times during each lesson.
5. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:
   \[
   8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
3. So, Brittany's phone can hold \(\frac{1800}{6} = 300\) photographs.
4. The number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
5. Let \( d \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
6. So, \( 300 = 50d \).
7. Solving for \( d \), we get \( d = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"Sasha has some leftover lumber that she wants to sell. She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each and five 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each. The prices have gone up by 50%, so she wants to sell them at the new prices.

First, let's figure out how much she paid for all the lumber:
- For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $10 = $100
- For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $16 = $80
- Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180

Now, let's calculate the new selling prices:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 * 1.5 = $15
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 * 1.5 = $24

Next, let's find out how much she will make from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $15 = $150
- Revenue from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $24 = $120
- Total revenue: $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit: $270 - $180 = $90

So, Sasha's profit is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To solve this problem, we need to use the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

First, let's add the parts of the ratio together:
7 (teaspoons of sugar) + 13 (cups of water) = 20 parts

We know the total amount of sugar and water used is 120. This total is made up of 20 parts. So, we can find out how much one part is by dividing the total by 20:
120 / 20 = 6

Now, we know that one part is 6. Since the sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by 6 to find the total amount of sugar:
7 * 6 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **First Day**: The customs officer counted 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles.
   - So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles.

2. **Second Day**: After more containers were brought in, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30.

3. **Vehicles Added on the Second Day**: To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles after the second day.
   - Vehicles added on the second day: \(30 - 10 = 20\) vehicles.

4. **Number of Containers on the Second Day**: Each container contains 5 vehicles. To find out how many containers were brought in on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container.
   - Number of containers: \(\frac{20}{5} = 4\) containers.

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. To find Lylah's salary, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

To find Lylah's salary, we divide both sides by 1.30:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.23.

Next, we need to find out what Adrien's salary is four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find out what Lylah's salary is four years later. Since her salary increased by the same percentage (40%) as Adrien's:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To figure out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts because her speed changes after the first 3 hours.

1. For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, we calculate the distance for this part:
   \[
   10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. After the first 3 hours, she slows down to 5 miles per hour. She runs for the remaining 4 hours at this speed. So, we calculate the distance for this part:
   \[
   5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance, we add the distances from both parts:

"To figure out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to do a few calculations. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Time Spent on Patients:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Calculate Total Cost:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

5. **Calculate Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets. We need to find out how many tickets they used in total.

First, let's figure out how many rides each of them took:
- Pam: 2 (roller coaster) + 2 (luge) = 4 rides
- Fred: 4 (roller coaster) + 2 (luge) = 6 rides

Now, let's add up the total number of rides:
- Total rides = 4 (Pam) + 6 (Fred) = 10 rides

First, we need to find out how many video games Brian has after he lost 5. Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we need to calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands:
   \[
   \text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female:
   \[
   \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the subs cost:
2 subs * $7.50 each = $15.00

Next, the cost of the chips:
2 bags of chips * $1.50 each = $3.00

Then, the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00 each = $2.00

Now, let's add these up to get the subtotal:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

There's a 20% delivery fee on the subtotal:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, we add the delivery fee and the tip to the subtotal:
$20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
$29.00

"Mark took a test yesterday that had 75 questions. He answered at a rate of 5 questions per hour and had 8 hours to complete it. So, let's figure out how many questions he finished:

\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he didn't finish is:

\[ 75 \, \text{questions} - 40 \, \text{questions} = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

Today, Mark took another test with 100 questions, also at a rate of 5 questions per hour, but this time he had 6 hours. So, the number of questions he finished is:

\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Since this test had 100 questions, the number of questions he didn't finish is:

\[ 100 \, \text{questions} - 30 \, \text{questions} = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:

\[ 35 \, \text{questions} + 70 \, \text{questions} = 105 \, \text{questions} \]

So, Mark left 105 questions incomplete.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that there are 12 blue gumballs. The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. 

First, let's set up the equation:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the number of pink gumballs
- \( B \) is the number of blue gumballs

We are given that \( B = 12 \). So, we substitute 12 for \( B \) in the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]

Next, we add the numbers:
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To figure out the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of them are automatic, and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We know there are 700 bees in total. We also know that:
- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
- There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (there are twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. \( W = 2B \) (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)

We also know the total number of bees:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Now, let's substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

To find \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out which items are food and which are not. The food items are:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

The nonfood items are:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Next, we add up the cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up the cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

There's a 10% tax on the nonfood items. To find the tax, we calculate 10% of 10 dollars:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the nonfood items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items (including tax):
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of everything is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how much profit Kim will make each week.

1. **Total Number of Clients:**
   - Kim already has 3 clients.
   - He is talking to 5 more potential clients.
   - So, the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8.

2. **Expenses per Client:**
   - Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so 2 bottles cost 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Each pack of cloths costs $5.
   - Therefore, the total cost per client is $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9.

3. **Total Expenses:**
   - With 8 clients, the total expenses are 8 * $9 = $72.

4. **Total Income:**
   - Kim calculates his total income each week to be $92.

5. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.
   - So, the profit is $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20.

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many pineapples John has in his field. He has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare has 100 pineapples. So, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare:

\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, we divide 12 by 3:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Now, to find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples he has by the number of times he can harvest them in a year:

\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

"Okay, let's figure out how many blocks Johnny has to pick up.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so that's \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, so that's \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add them all up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 blocks.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the first group leave.
   - So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - All the bees that left and haven't returned yet come back.
   - Bees that left in the first 6 hours and haven't returned: \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6 hours and haven't returned: 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours: \( 15 + 60 = 75 \) bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To figure out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the cost of the tickets and the change she got back.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom got $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"Okay, let's figure out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute.

- Steve lives 3 miles from the school. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, Steve's distance is:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}
  \]

- Tim lives 2 miles from the school. So, Tim's distance is:
  \[
  2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

- Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. So, the time it takes for Steve to get home is:
  \[
  \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute. So, the time it takes for Tim to get home is:
  \[
  \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting.

- The difference in time is:
  \[
  40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
  \]

So, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many tires were inflated for each type of vehicle:

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came by with bicycles, so the total number of bicycle tires is:
     \[
     5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
     \]

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came by with tricycles, so the total number of tricycle tires is:
     \[
     3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
     \]

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came by with a unicycle, so the total number of unicycle tires is:
     \[
     1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
     \]

Next, we add up all the tires:
\[
10 \text{ bicycle tires} + 9 \text{ tricycle tires} + 1 \text{ unicycle tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, the total cost is:
\[
20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[
500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, each cookie costs $0.10. So, the total cost for all the cookies is:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he gets, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, Carl receives $4.00 in change.

"Okay, let's figure out how many french fries Dave had when he bought the pack. We'll go through the problem step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries.
4. A raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off one fry.
6. Five fries were left.

Let's set up the equation to find out how many fries Dave originally had. We'll call the total number of fries \( x \).

1. After Dave ate 14 fries, there were \( x - 14 \) fries left.
2. The seagull ate 7 fries, so there were \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries left.
3. The three pigeons ate 9 fries, so there were \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries left.
4. The raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \) fries. This means there were \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \) fries left.
5. The ants took 1 fry, so there were \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \) fries left.
6. We know that 5 fries were left, so we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
   \]

2. Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   x - 30 = 18
   \]

3. Add 30 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 48
   \]

So, Dave originally had 48 fries in the pack.

"To figure out how many hours Kimo spends in class during one semester, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the class schedule:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long. So, he spends 3 hours each of these days.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. So, he spends 4 hours each of these days.

Now, let's calculate the total hours per week:
- For Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours}\)
- For Tuesdays and Thursdays: \(2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours}\)

Adding these together gives the total hours per week:
\[9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Kimo spends in class over the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in the semester, so:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

"To figure out the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert everything to feet and then add up the lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - Add the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes together:
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To figure out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first need to add up how many bananas all the apes eat in one month. 

- Monkeys eat 200 bananas.
- Gorillas eat 400 bananas.
- Baboons eat 100 bananas.

So, in one month, the total number of bananas needed is:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to double this amount:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

First, let's figure out how far Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each back and forth is 100 yards there and 100 yards back, so that's 200 yards per run.
- So, Blake runs \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

Now, let's figure out how far Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is 200 yards.
- Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- Each run to the 40-yard line and back is 40 yards there and 40 yards back, so that's 80 yards per run.
- So, Kelly runs \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards for these runs.
- Adding the first run, Kelly runs \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

Now, let's find out how much farther the winner runs:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2920 yards.
- The difference is \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

So, the winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser.

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. Let's figure out how many fish they caught in total.

First, let's see how many of each type of fish Locsin caught:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:
- Total starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish
- Total sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses
- Total clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish

Finally, let's add up all the fish:
- Total fish: 15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 fish

"To figure out how much a bag of marbles will cost after 36 months, we need to understand how the price increases over time. The price goes up by 20% of the original price every two months. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Price**: The bag of marbles starts at $20.
2. **Increase Rate**: Every two months, the price goes up by 20% of the original price, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
3. **Number of Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, in 36 months, there will be 36 / 2 = 18 increases.

Now, each time the price increases, it doesn't just add $4; it multiplies by 1.20 (which is 1 + 0.20). So, we need to multiply the initial price by 1.20, 18 times.

The formula to calculate the final price is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Let's do the math:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Using a calculator:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

"To find out how much all the toys are worth, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - Total cost of red cars = 5 * $4 = $20.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - Total cost of action figures = 3 * $5 = $15.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Cost of 3 action figures = 3 * $5 = $15.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
- Total cost of red cars = $20

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the income lost if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - Jackie will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour.
   - So, the income lost is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

2. **Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. **Determine the difference:**
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she loses $105.
   - If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.
   - The difference is $105 - $90 = $15.

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"Elvira has a budget of €1500 for her 30th birthday to buy a new computer and some accessories. She picked out a computer that costs €1090, which includes a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also chose a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. To find out how much money she will have left for a garment, we need to add up the costs of the items she's buying and then subtract that total from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of items:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \]

Now, subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1423 = 77 \]

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"To figure out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans, we can break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many eggs are needed for 15 flans. Each flan needs 3 eggs, so:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Each time she babysits, she gets 9 eggs, so:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ times} \]

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. Let's call Brooke's age \( B \) and Seth's age \( S \). So, we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many miles Pancho walks on weekdays and how many miles he walks on weekends.

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks:
  \[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), Pancho walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks:
  \[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

"To figure out the total cost of each uniform, we need to break it down into the cost of each part: the hat, the jacket, and the pants.

1. **Hat**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, the jacket costs:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Pants**: The pants cost the average of the hat and the jacket. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket and then divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of the uniform:
\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Jessica has to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on all her debts.

1. **Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. **Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   So, 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment is $500.

3. **Calculate the total monthly payment with the extra 50%:**
   - Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

4. **Calculate the total annual payment:**
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12

   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Billy has 60 potatoes to prep. He needs to peel and cut each one. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \) seconds.

Now, we need to convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so \( 300 \div 60 = 5 \) minutes.

Finally, we add the peeling time and the cutting time together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan is 30 years old.
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).

3. **Use the information from two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was \( M - 2 \) years old.
   - Two years ago, Jan was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \) years old.
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - So, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

4. **Solve for Mark's age:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

5. **Find Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - \( J = M + 2 \)
   - \( J = 21 + 2 \)
   - \( J = 23 \)

So, Jean is 23 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Compare the Probabilities
We need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

So, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. We need to figure out how many rats are in each cage based on the total amount of straw distributed.

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let's call the number of rats in each cage \( r \).

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Since each cage has one hamster, there are 10 hamsters in total.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits.
   - 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw:**
   - The total amount of straw distributed is 160 pieces.

Now, let's set up the equation for the total straw:

\[ \text{Total straw} = (\text{straw for rats}) + (\text{straw for hamsters}) + (\text{straw for rabbits}) \]

First, calculate the straw for the hamsters:
\[ \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces/hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the straw for the rabbits:
\[ \text{Straw for rabbits} = 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, express the straw for the rats in terms of \( r \):
\[ \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces/rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

Using the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To figure out how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a 2% monthly interest, we can use a simple formula. The formula to calculate the total amount with interest is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Months}} \]

Here's what we know:
- Principal (P) = $100
- Interest Rate (r) = 2% per month = 0.02
- Number of Months (n) = 3

Now, let's plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 \]

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.02 \):

\[ 1 + 0.02 = 1.02 \]

Next, raise 1.02 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.02^3 = 1.061208 \]

4. The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. The profit per bag is $30 - $22 = $8.
6. The trader made a total profit of $400.

To find out how many bags the trader sold, we can set up the equation:
\[ 8 \times \text{number of bags} = 400 \]

Now, solve for the number of bags:
\[ \text{number of bags} = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

Then, they went on two different rides, and each ride cost $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on Sue's front yard.
   - So, after this, there were \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos left, and 6 white flamingos were added.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.

This means 80 pounds of carrots are given out. We started with 200 pounds, so to find out how many pounds are left over, we subtract the 80 pounds that were given out from the 200 pounds we started with:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

"Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards. 

In the first month, she collects three times the number she started with, so she collects:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards} \]

In the second month, she collects 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month, so she collects:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards} \]

In the third month, she collects twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is:
\[ 60 + 40 = 100 \text{ cards} \]
So, in the third month, she collects:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards} \]

Now, we add up all the cards she has:
\[ 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards} \]

So, Elaine has a total of 320 Pokemon cards now.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and he edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers. So, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. So, for 500 sentences, he earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

3. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 10 cents per sentence. So, for 500 sentences, he earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

4. To find out how much Mark makes in total, we add the earnings from both publishers:
   \[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Each pail contains 5 liters of water. To find out how many liters of water he gets in a day, we multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water in each pail:
\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

"John won an award at work that gave him a one-time reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in his weekly salary. He makes $2000 a week, and he got the award on the first day of the year. We need to figure out how much money he made that year.

First, let's calculate his new weekly salary after the 5% raise:
- 5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
- So, his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Next, let's find out how much he makes in a year with his new salary:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- So, his new annual salary is $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

Now, we add the one-time reward to his new annual salary:
- Total money made in the year = $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.

So, John made $114,200 that year.

$114,200"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. She has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
   - So, 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes per year.

2. Next, we need to convert the tons of grapes into barrels of wine. Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.
   - So, 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year.

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"Okay, let's figure out how many slices of cheese Carl used this week.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, let's add up all the cheese used:
- Total cheese used: \( 14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 31 \text{ slices} \).

So, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese this week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Green Pens**: Janet had 22 green pens.
2. **Yellow Pens**: Janet had 10 yellow pens.
3. **Blue Pens**: Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:
   \[
   6 \times 9 = 54
   \]
4. **Red Pens**: Janet bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag had 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

Now, let's add up all the pens:
\[
22 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (yellow)} + 54 \text{ (blue)} + 12 \text{ (red)} = 98
\]

So, Janet has 98 pens now.

"To figure out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the lowest score from the first five tests:**
   - Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
   - The lowest score is 71.

2. **Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores:**
   - The remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, and 86.
   - Sum of these scores: \( 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \).

3. **Determine the total sum needed for an average of 93 with five tests:**
   - To get an average of 93 with five tests, the total sum of the scores should be \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \).

4. **Calculate the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The sum of the five highest scores (including the sixth test) should be 465.
   - Therefore, \( 367 + x = 465 \).
   - Solving for \( x \): \( x = 465 - 367 = 98 \).

So, Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"Okay, let's figure out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total.

First, for the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Next, for the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods:
- Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

So, Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers.

"To figure out the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to break it down into two parts: the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
- So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \) grams.

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples:
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
- Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple must weigh \( 40 \div 2 = 20 \) grams.
- Joe has 80 candied apples.
- So, the total weight of the candied apples is \( 80 \times 20 = 1600 \) grams.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag:
- Total weight = weight of chocolate bars + weight of candied apples
- Total weight = 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes} \]

Now, let's add up all the cakes she bought over the three days:
\[ 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Total cost of 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:**
   - One dozen = 12 cups.
   - Twenty dozen = 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. **Calculate the cost of each cup:**
   - Total cost of 240 cups = $34800.
   - Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:

"To figure out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to buy the jacket and shoes, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Items:**
   - Jacket: $30
   - 2 pairs of shoes: 2 × $20 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. **Money Sara Already Has:**
   - Initial savings: $10

3. **Money Sara Earns from Babysitting:**
   - Earnings per babysitting session: $5
   - Number of babysitting sessions: 4
   - Total earnings from babysitting: 4 × $5 = $20

4. **Total Money Sara Has After Babysitting:**
   - Initial savings + Babysitting earnings: $10 + $20 = $30

5. **Additional Money Needed:**
   - Total cost of items - Total money Sara has: $70 - $30 = $40

6. **Earnings from Mowing the Lawn:**
   - Earnings per lawn mowed: $4
   - Number of lawns needed to mow: $40 ÷ $4 = 10

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( R \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( W \) be the number of white chickens.

We know from the problem:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

Now, we can set up an equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Next, substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8R = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To figure out how long Gary spends walking, we need to first find out the total distance he walks. Since the park is a rectangle, we can find the perimeter by adding up all the sides. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

The length of the park is 6 miles, and the width is 1.5 miles. So, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks 15 miles. To find out how long it takes him, we use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. So, we can plug in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to add the customers from the first two days and subtract that from the total:

100 (first day) + 150 (second day) = 250 customers in the first two days.

Now, subtract this from the total number of customers over the three days:

500 (total) - 250 (first two days) = 250 customers on the third day.

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have two pools, a big one and a small one, both leaking at 4 gallons per minute. We need to figure out how much water is in the small pool right now.

1. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool right now.
   - Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool right now.

2. **Information from 4 minutes ago:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since it lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons (since it also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).

3. **Given conditions:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]
   - Right now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B = 4S
     \]

4. **Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:**
   \[
   4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

5. **Simplify and solve for \( S \):**
   \[
   4S + 16 = 2S + 32
   \]
   \[
   4S - 2S = 32 - 16
   \]
   \[
   2S = 16
   \]
   \[
   S = 8
   \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back an extra 10% on top of that. First, let's figure out what 10% of $2000 is:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 each month for 12 months. Let's calculate the total amount she will pay over these 12 months:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she will still owe after making these payments. We subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back:

3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Naomi's Score**: We know Naomi scored 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score. Half of 68 is 34, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
3. **Brianna's Score**: Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from 251:

"James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 more grass type, we need to figure out the new total and the new number of water type cards.

First, let's update the number of each type:
- Fire type: 30 (no change)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the new total number of cards:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:

   - To find out how long it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   - Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

So, the final answer is:

1 hour"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons. When Ashlyn went to the farm after two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. 

To find out how many watermelons were ready, we calculate 30% of 120:
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home. This means the number of watermelons left on the farm is:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

Two weeks later, Ashlyn came back and found that 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

To find out how many of these 84 watermelons were ready, we calculate 3/4 of 84:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

So, Ashlyn harvested 63 more watermelons. This means the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons} \]

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the Cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Total tax = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration Fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Total registration fees = 12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration fees
   - Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

276,000"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday, so she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells.

"Alright, so if Dax found half as many bugs as there were ants, and there were 50 ants, then the number of bugs would be:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. We start with 36 penguins sunbathing.
2. One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   This means 12 penguins jump in the ocean.
3. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   This means 12 penguins go inside the cave.
4. Now, we add the number of penguins that left for both activities:
   \[
   12 + 12 = 24
   \]
5. Finally, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins:
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes every day.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so Steve eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) tomatoes per week.
3. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats \(42 \div 2 = 21\) tomatoes per week.
4. Together, they eat \(42 + 21 = 63\) tomatoes per week.
5. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
6. To find out how many vines are needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat by the number of tomatoes each vine produces: \(63 \div 3 = 21\).

So, Steve needs 21 vines.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza John's friends will eat in total. John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices.
   - Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

2. Next, we need to know how many slices are in one pizza. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
   - Slices per pizza = 8.

3. Now, we can calculate how many pizzas John needs to order by dividing the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza.
   - Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza
   - Number of pizzas needed = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Batch of New Pens**: When he uses up these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from 25 empty pens, he can make 5 new pens.
3. **Second Batch of New Pens**: After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens. From these 5 empty pens, he can make 1 more new pen.
4. **Final Count**: After using this last pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another full pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is:

25 (initial pens) + 5 (first batch of new pens) + 1 (second batch of new pens) = 31

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know there were 1000 students in the school hall. 

1. **Exit A**: 30% of the students left through exit A. 
   - 30% of 1000 is \( 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \) students.
   - So, 300 students left through exit A.

2. **Remaining Students**: After 300 students left through exit A, the number of students left in the hall is:
   - \( 1000 - 300 = 700 \) students.

3. **Exit B**: 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B.
   - 3/5 of 700 is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \) students.
   - So, 420 students left through exit B.

4. **Exit C**: The rest of the students left through exit C.
   - The number of students left after exits A and B is:
   - \( 700 - 420 = 280 \) students.

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

280"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that John has 54 candies. The problem also tells us that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, we can figure out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has compared to James. We do this by subtracting the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

1. **Number of Pen Pals:**
   Mike originally had 5 pen pals. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he now has:
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}
   \]

2. **Letters Received:**
   Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives each week is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ letters}
   \]

3. **Pages to Write:**
   Each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike responds to each letter with the same number of pages. So, the total number of pages he needs to write each week is:
   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. **Time Spent Writing:**
   Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is:
   \[
   30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Daily calls with the boss:**
   - Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - So, the total minutes for calls with the boss is \( 15 \times 30 = 450 \) minutes.

2. **Extra calls to other people:**
   - Jason has also used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total minutes used:**
   - Add the minutes for calls with the boss and the extra minutes: \( 450 + 300 = 750 \) minutes.

4. **Minutes remaining:**
   - Jason's phone plan allows him 1000 minutes per month.
   - Subtract the total minutes used from the monthly allowance: \( 1000 - 750 = 250 \) minutes.

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

"Okay, let's work through this step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let's say Ginger gave Griffin \( x \) fries.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have two aquariums. One has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4, which is 28.

The problem states that this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium \( f \).

So, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2f) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Now, solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
3. Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
5. After the movie, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount.

First, let's find out how much Jean pays per day:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours/day} = 1500 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Next, let's find out how much Jean pays per week:
\[ 1500 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 6000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, let's find out how much Jean pays for the entire 5 weeks:
\[ 6000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Jean pays after the discount is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} - 3000 \text{ dollars} = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jean paid:
\[ 27000 \]"

- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Now, let's add these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

The total cost is $96. Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, that means the cost is divided by 3 people.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we add up the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies:**
- Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies
- Her sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Now, we need to convert the number of cookies into calories. Each cookie has 200 calories.

**Total calories:**
- Sue: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
- Her sister: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, we find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

**Difference in calories:**

"To figure out how many boys are in the third class, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Students in the School:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - So, the total number of students is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \).

2. **Total Number of Girls and Boys:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Therefore, there are \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) girls and \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) boys in the school.

3. **Number of Girls in Each Class:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - The total number of girls in the first and second classes is \( 15 + 12 = 27 \).

4. **Number of Girls in the Third Class:**
   - Since there are 30 girls in total and 27 are in the first and second classes, the number of girls in the third class is \( 30 - 27 = 3 \).

5. **Number of Boys in the Third Class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - The third class has 3 girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is \( 20 - 3 = 17 \).

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

Next, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and then subtract that from 30.

30% of 30 is:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \] times.

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know there are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows. So, the total number of cows initially is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. So, the number of new cows per stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall will have the original 20 cows plus the 2 new cows:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 176 \]"

"To figure out how much the redwood tree weighs after the termites ate some of it, we need to follow a few steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much the whole tree weighed before the termites got to it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and every 10 feet of the tree weighs 400 pounds. So, we divide 200 feet by 10 feet to find out how many 10-foot sections there are:
   \[
   200 \div 10 = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]
   Then, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:
   \[
   20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much weight the termites removed. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. To find 30% of 8000 pounds, we multiply 8000 by 0.30:
   \[
   8000 \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood the termites ate from the original weight of the tree to find the remaining weight:

1. **Andrea's Apples:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.

2. **Jamal's Apples:**
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - So, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

3. **Jamal's Bananas:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - So, if Jamal has 44 apples, he has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

4. **Andrea's Bananas:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - So, if Jamal has 48 bananas, Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

5. **Total Fruits:**
   - Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.
   - Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.
   - Total fruits: \(76 + 92 = 168\).

So, the total number of fruits is 168.

"To figure out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to know how many cookies she's making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so:

36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many dozens 66 cookies make, we divide 66 by 12:

66 ÷ 12 = 5.5 dozens

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for each dozen, we multiply 5.5 by 2 to find the total cups of flour needed:

2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. So, Ferdinand has:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees}
   \]
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, Harry has:
   \[
   2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees}
   \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has compared to Ferdinand:
\[
11 - 3 = 8
\]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts each girl has:
- Carmen: $100
- Samantha: $125
- Daisy: $175

Total combined amount: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400

So, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is $400.

"Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that won't cost more than $400,000. She found a house that costs $350,000. But, there are extra costs: a 5% brokerage fee and a 12% transfer fee, both based on the selling price of the house.

First, let's figure out the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times 350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times 350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total price:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Finally, we need to see how much more this total price is compared to Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"To figure out how much Mr. Tan made after selling his house, we need to subtract all his expenses from the selling price.

1. **Selling Price:**
   The house was sold for $400,000.

2. **Transfer Fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   3\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount:**
   Mr. Tan still owed $250,000 on the house.

5. **Total Expenses:**
   Add up all the expenses:
   \[
   12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000
   \]

6. **Net Proceeds:**
   Subtract the total expenses from the selling price:
   \[
   400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000
   \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

\[
\boxed{118000}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes:
   \[
   0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   So, it takes an additional 8 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
   \[
   20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:** 
   \[
   20 + 28 = 48 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
   \[
   48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** 
   \[
   48 + 43 = 91 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:
91"
"To figure out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to do a couple of simple calculations.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
- Each newspaper ad costs $5.
- So, the total cost for newspaper ads is 50 ads * $5/ad = $250.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The agent bought 15 television ads.
- Each television ad costs $75.
- So, the total cost for television ads is 15 ads * $75/ad = $1125.

Now, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to get the total amount spent:
- Total cost = $250 (newspaper ads) + $1125 (television ads) = $1375.

So, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads.

"To figure out how many blue golf balls there are, let's break it down step by step:

1. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of these balls are golf balls. So, we need to find half of 16:
   \[
   \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]
   This means there are 8 golf balls.
3. Half of the golf balls are blue. So, we need to find half of 8:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]
   This means there are 4 blue golf balls.

So, the number of blue golf balls is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many M&Ms Mary has in total.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add up the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

So, Mary has a total of 762 M&Ms.

762"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many windows are in the bedrooms of one house.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - So, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

2. Next, we need to add the additional windows in one house.
   - Each house has 4 additional windows.
   - So, the total number of windows in one house is \(6 + 4 = 10\).

3. Since John has 2 houses, we need to double the number of windows in one house.
   - The total number of windows in both houses is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

"To figure out how much change the mom gets back, we need to add up the cost of the items she bought and then subtract that total from the $20 she paid.

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20, the laundry detergent is $9.45, and the pasta is $1.35. Let's add these up:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. Now, we subtract this from the $20 she paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

The cashier gives her $5.00 in change.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so that's \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total project is 1800 stitches, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

315"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on the seeds.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is \( 20 \times 40 = 800 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is \( 80 \times 30 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Overall total cost: \( 800 + 2400 = 3200 \) dollars

So, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

3200"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how many lines Sean has to memorize.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines. So, Sean has to memorize 54 lines for the song.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines in the first scene.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines are Sean's in the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines in the second scene.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines are Sean's in the second scene.

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Lines from the song: 54
   - Lines from the first scene: 36
   - Lines from the second scene: 48
   - Total: \( 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \)

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Carly had 80 cards in total.
2. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \text{ cards with A}
   \]
3. After removing the cards with A, we have:
   \[
   80 - 32 = 48 \text{ cards left}
   \]
4. 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ cards with B}
   \]
5. After removing the cards with B, we have:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ cards left}
   \]
6. 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \text{ cards with C}
   \]
7. After removing the cards with C, we have:
   \[
   24 - 15 = 9 \text{ cards left}

"To figure out how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.
- So, the total time for the small holes is 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.
- So, the total time for the large holes is 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, let's add the total times for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

"Okay, so Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 right now. In 10 years, both of them will be 10 years older. So, we need to add 10 years to each of their ages. That means we add 10 + 10 = 20 years to their current total age.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
20 + 20 = 40

40"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Sam's current age is \( S \) years.
2. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \) years.
3. In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \) years, and Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \) years.
4. The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]
5. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   \]
6. Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
   \[
   3S + 9 = 27
   \]
7. Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   3S = 18
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   S = 6
   \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To figure out how much Peter paid in total, we need to do two things: first, calculate the cost of the popsicles, and then calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. After that, we add both costs together.

For the popsicles:
- Peter bought 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- So, the total cost for the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.

For the ice cream bars:
- Peter bought 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.00.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together:
- Total cost = $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00.

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots. The problem also tells us that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, if a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba must have half of that:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. So, the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. So, the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total number of spots for the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final answer is:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are needed. Each pizza serves 3 people, so:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To figure out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones.
   - So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - The topaz gemstones take up 8 inches.
   - So, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
   - To find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 0.25.
   - \( 17 \div 0.25 = 68 \).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much money Kelly has in total. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
  5 * 25 = 125 cents

- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
  2 * 10 = 20 cents

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To figure out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we first need to count the total number of stars in the rows that have 8 and 6 stars.

There are three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has 76 stars in total. So, the number of stars left for the 5-star rows is:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row has 5 stars. To find out how many 5-star rows there are, we divide the remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

"To figure out how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a family of 5 who eat rice at lunch and dinner, we can break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - They eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   So, the total rice consumed per meal is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]

   Since they eat two meals a day:
   \[
   1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   So, the total rice consumed per week is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last:**
   - The bag contains 42 kg of rice.

   So, the number of weeks the bag will last is:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Sam's goal is to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend to sell bread.

Here's what he sold:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

First, let's add up all the crates he sold:
15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) + 20 (Weekend) = 65 crates

Now, we need to see how many crates he was off from his target of 120 crates:
120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how much John pays for the driving service in a year.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away.
   - He goes there and back each day, so that's 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - The driving service charges $2 per mile.
   - So, the cost for 15,000 miles is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver:**
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus each month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 months = $1,800.

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - The total cost for the miles driven is $30,000.
   - The total bonus is $1,800.
   - So, the total annual cost is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is:
$31,800"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.

To find out how much time he needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to add the time he exercised on Sunday and Monday:
23 + 16 = 39 minutes

Now, Peter wants to exercise for twice that amount on Tuesday. So, we multiply the total time by 2:
39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To figure out how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to think about how the pages are arranged. Each piece of paper, when folded, can hold 4 pages: two on the front and two on the back.

So, if we have 32 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can hold:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

"To figure out how much money Elise made in the second year, we need to break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Books and Unsold Books:**
   - Elise started with 250 books.
   - She has 50 unsold books left.
   - So, the number of books she has sold over the three years is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Books Sold in the Current Year:**
   - This year, she sold 45 books.

3. **Books Sold in the First Year:**
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year.
   - So, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books}
     \]

4. **Books Sold in the Second Year:**
   - We know the total number of books sold over the three years is 200.
   - We also know the number of books sold in the first and current years.
   - So, the number of books sold in the second year is:
     \[
     200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 \text{ books}
     \]

5. **Earnings in the Second Year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Therefore, the total earnings in the second year are:
     \[
     65 \times 20 = 1300 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's figure out how much Watson made in April.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - There are about 4 weeks in a month, so \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) working days in April.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 20 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 200 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 200 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2000 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - Total bonus for April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2000.
   - Total bonus: $1200.
   - Total earnings: \( 2000 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3200 \text{ dollars} \).

"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he loses to, we first need to figure out how many people he beats. 

80% of 20 is calculated like this:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beats 16 people. Since he arm wrestles 20 people in total, the number of people he loses to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of the loaves. So, we need to find out how many loaves that is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After selling 40 loaves in the morning, we need to figure out how many loaves are left:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. These 10 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to figure out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so:
   \[
   \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. So, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to see how many 4-week periods it takes for her to lose 8 pounds. Since she loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Number of 4-week periods} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4
   \]

4. Since each period is 4 weeks, the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:
   \[
   4 \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

   - In 15 days, the number of new arms is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **New Legs:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of new legs is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of new arms and new legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (new arms) + 3 (new legs) = 8

So, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Theo spends on the business suits:
- He buys 6 suits at $100 each.
- So, 6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
- He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- So, 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, let's find out how much the flight ticket costs:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- The cost of one business suit is $100.
- So, 5 * $100 = $500
- Adding $700 to $500 gives us $1200 for the flight ticket.

Now, let's add up all the expenses so far:
- Suits: $600
- Suitcases: $150
- Flight ticket: $1200
- Total expenses: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
- Total money: $6000
- Savings: $2000
- Amount to spend: $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
- Amount to spend: $4000
- Total expenses: $1950
- Amount left for gifts: $4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To figure out how many eggs the family eats in a week, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs the family eats each day:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so that's 3 people * 3 eggs = 9 eggs.
- The other two people eat 2 eggs each day, so that's 2 people * 2 eggs = 4 eggs.

Now, we add the eggs eaten by both groups to get the total daily consumption:
- 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs per day.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs the family eats in a week:
- There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
- 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs.

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Cera's Age:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, he is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - So, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We know that the football team has 105 members in total. We also know that:
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.
- There are half as many players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's use \( D \) to represent the number of players on the defense. Then:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the defense, offense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, let's combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \times 3D + 2 \times \frac{D}{2} = 2 \times 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to account for the people who can't come:
- 8 people couldn't come because they were sick.
- 1/4 of the number of sick people had previous commitments: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people

So, the total number of people who can't come is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

The problem states that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. We need to find out how many electric poles are required.

To solve this, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let's call the number of electric poles \( x \). So, we have:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
x \times 3 = 45 \times 1
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 45

2. **Number of people who left:**
   - After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 people left.

3. **Number of people remaining:**
   - The total number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

4. **Number of men remaining:**
   - We know that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Number of women remaining:**
   - The total number of people remaining is 30.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which add up to 26 pencils in total. We can set up an equation to find out how many pencils are in each box:

\[ 3 \times \text{pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{pencils per box} = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and her sister Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Adding these together gives:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To figure out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to look at two things: the ice cubes and the cream.

1. **Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Shannon wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes she needs, we divide 65 by 13:
     \[
     \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}

2. **Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also makes the coffee weaker.

3. **Total Weakening:**
   - To find the total weakening, we add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Let's say \( x \) is the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So now there are \( x + 5 \) people on the bus.
3. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Let's simplify that:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Okay, let's figure out how many lollipops Oscar has step by step.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
5. Adding the 28 lollipops he bought to the 8 he has left:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
6. He eats 3 lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
7. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]

So, Oscar has 31 lollipops left.

"To figure out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to do a few simple steps.

First, we need to know how much more charge the phone needs. The phone is at 60%, and we want it to be at 100%. So, we subtract:

100% - 60% = 40%

This means the phone needs 40 more percentage points to be fully charged.

Next, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. To find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage points, we multiply:

40 percentage points * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide:

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - They earn $1 off for every $20 spent.
   - So, the number of rewards is \( \frac{80}{20} = 4 \).

2. **Determine the discounts used on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer used 4 rewards, which means a $4 discount.
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of the rewards off the price, so the coupon discount is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

3. **Calculate the total discount:**
   - Total discount = Discount from rewards + Discount from coupon
   - Total discount = $4 + $8 = $12

4. **Calculate the amount paid on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $43.
   - Subtract the total discount from the amount spent.
   - Amount paid = $43 - $12 = $31

So, the customer paid:

- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the Cozy Homes offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we need to find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

So, the cost difference between the two offers is $100.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have a class of 200 students, and they are split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups \( x \). The smallest group, then, has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and these animals are either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's use some simple algebra to find out how many cows and chickens there are.

1. Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
2. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is the sum of the cows and the chickens:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3C = 60 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, there are 20 cows. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows:
\[ 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, there are 40 chickens.

Next, we need to find out how many legs all these animals have together.

- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Here's what we can figure out from the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. So, the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. So, the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. So, the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds.

- Juice Box B: $4 (cost of A) + $5 = $9
- Juice Box C: $4 (cost of A) + $7 = $11

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:
- $11 (cost of C) - $9 (cost of B) = $2

So, Juice Box C costs $2 more than Juice Box B.

"To figure out how much more money the factory is making now, we need to compare the daily earnings from tractors to the daily earnings from silos.

First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:
- The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.
- So, the daily earnings from tractors were \(10 \times 100 = 1000\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:
- Now, the factory sells 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.
- So, the daily earnings from silos are \(5 \times 220 = 1100\) dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more money the factory is making per day with silos compared to tractors:
- The increase in daily earnings is \(1100 - 1000 = 100\) dollars.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Earnings}}{\text{Original Earnings}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To figure out how much Madeline spends on her dog each year, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, the monthly cost of treats is $20.

Then, the monthly cost of medicine is $100.

Now, let's add up all the monthly costs:
- Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
- Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

To find the annual cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
- Total annual cost = $220 * 12 = $2640.

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. So, he spent:
- 6 hours boating
- 3 hours swimming (since half of 6 is 3)

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. So, he spent:
- 3 shows × 2 hours/show = 6 hours watching shows

Now, let's add up all the time he spent on these activities:
- 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours

The problem states that these 15 hours represent 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. We can set up the equation to find the total time \( T \):
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To solve for \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours.

The problem also states that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we calculate:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

   Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the total change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying gumballs is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how much money Billy spent on candy:**
   Billy started with $10 and had $4 left as change after buying candy.
   \[
   10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   The candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:
   \[
   \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Carver just turned 45 years old, and he is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We need to find out how old his son is.

Let's call the son's age \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So we can write this as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
   - Then it goes 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
   - Finally, it goes 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs to get back to the first city. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is:
     \[
     75 + 100 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
     \]

   Adding these distances together gives the total distance for one complete trip:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes 3 trips a day.
   - So, the total distance traveled in one day is:
     \[
     300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
     \]

3. **Determine how many days the train can go before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   - To find out how many days it can go before needing service, we divide the total service distance by the daily distance:
     \[
     \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
     \]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days.

"To figure out how much stuffing Mark needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the stuffing for a collie bed:**
   - A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - The collie bed needs the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.
   - Average = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - Total for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

3. **Calculate the total stuffing for 3 collie beds:**
   - Each collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - Total for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

4. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed:**
   - Total for 4 chihuahua beds = 8 pounds.
   - Total for 3 collie beds = 15 pounds.
   - Total amount of stuffing = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing.

"To figure out how long John's trip took, we need to break it down into two parts: the trip to his friend's house and the trip back home.

### First Part: Trip to Friend's House
- **Distance:** 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
- **Speed:** 70 miles per hour (mph)
- **Time:** Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

### Second Part: Trip Back Home
- **Distance:** 240 miles
- **Speed:** 80 miles per hour (mph)
- **Time:** Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

### Total Time for the Trip
- **Total Time:** Time for first part + Time for second part = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

So, the total time for John's trip is 6 hours.

"To figure out the minimum number of points Jane needs on her third test, we need to add up the points she already has and see how many more she needs to reach 42 points.

First, let's add the points from her first two tests:
15 (first test) + 18 (second test) = 33 points

Now, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach 42:
42 (total needed) - 33 (points she has) = 9 points

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks. Let's call this number \( M \), so \( M = 3 \).

Next, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people who refused to wear masks, minus 5. So, we calculate:
\[ 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Then, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We need to find out how many were kicked out for other reasons. Let's call this number \( O \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ M + \text{(number of shoplifters)} + \text{(number of people for physical violence)} + O = 50 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50 \]

Now, we solve for \( O \):
\[ 31 + O = 50 \]
\[ O = 50 - 31 \]
\[ O = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 19 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. We know that Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 more points, Erin now has three times as many points as Sara.
3. So, Erin's total points after scoring 14 more is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) points.
4. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring the 14 points, we subtract 14 from her total points after scoring.

So, \(24 - 14 = 10\).

Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

   - Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames: \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Etching:**
   - Each picture frame needs to be etched, which adds 20% to the cost.
   - Additional cost per frame: \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Total additional cost for etching: \( 44 \times 4 = 176 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will also receive pins.
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

"To figure out how much Ethan spent making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings first. The wallpaper costs $400 at the market, and making it himself saves 20%.

First, let's find out what 20% of $400 is:
\[ 20\% \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80 by making the wallpaper himself. Now, we subtract the savings from the original price to find the total cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: They sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday. So, \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: They sold half the number of pairs sold on Saturday. So, \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. But 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

Now, let's add up the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) shoes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The company bought equipment worth $400,000.
2. 40% of the equipment was faulty. To find out how much the faulty equipment is worth, we need to calculate 40% of $400,000.

\[ \text{Value of faulty equipment} = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

3. The company returned the faulty equipment, so we need to subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total cost to find out how much they spent on the functioning equipment.

\[ \text{Value of functioning equipment} = 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

"To figure out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   - Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday and made $56.
   - Since each apple is sold for $4, we can find out how many apples she sold by dividing the total money by the price per apple.
   - \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \) apples.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - So, \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) apples.

Now, let's add up the apples picked over the three days:
- Monday: 14 apples
- Tuesday: 12 apples
- Wednesday: 24 apples

Total apples picked:

"To figure out how much Karan has to pay each month, we need to first find out the total interest she will have to pay over the five months. Then, we add this interest to the amount she borrowed to get the total amount she needs to pay back. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months to find out the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest formula is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 of a year (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}

"To figure out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means that the 12.8 hectares represent the remaining \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land.

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what the whole amount of land (100% or 1) would be.

1. First, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times \text{Total Land} = 12.8 \text{ hectares}
   \]

2. To find the total land, we need to isolate the total land on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   \text{Total Land} = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]

3. Now, let's do the multiplication:
   \[
   12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"David and Dasha went to the carnival, and they both want to ride all 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 ride tickets, and each ticket costs $2. You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 that gives you 9 rides.

First, let's figure out how much Dasha spends. Dasha buys tickets for each ride:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2, so each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, she spends \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Now, let's see how much David spends. David buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives him 9 rides.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the total cost of buying tickets for all 9 rides:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30
- David's savings: \(36 - 30 = 6\) dollars

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."

"To figure out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to break down the total number of popsicles based on the ratio given.

The ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we add the parts of the ratio together:
5 (Betty's part) + 6 (Sam's part) = 11 parts in total.

Next, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts to find out how many popsicles each part represents:
165 popsicles ÷ 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15.

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

1. **Netflix Cost:**
   - Netflix costs $10 a month.

2. **Hulu and Disney Plus Cost with Discount:**
   - Normally, each costs $10 a month, so together they cost $20 a month.
   - With a 20% discount, he saves 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - So, the cost for both with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16 a month.

3. **Total Streaming Services Cost:**
   - Adding the cost of Netflix and the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
   - $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 a month.

4. **Savings:**
   - The cable package costs $60 a month.
   - The total cost of the streaming services is $26 a month.
   - So, the savings are $60 - $26 = $34 a month.

Tim saves \(\boxed{34}\) dollars per month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services."
"To figure out what percentage of her total work time Carol spent editing, we need to follow a few steps:

1. First, let's find out how long she spent recording the song. Since she spent 4 hours writing the song and half that time recording it, she spent:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} \div 2 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   recording the song.

2. Now, let's convert all the times to minutes to make it easier to add them up:
   - Writing: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
   - Recording: 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
   - Editing: 90 minutes (already in minutes)

3. Next, we add up all the time she spent on the song:
   \[
   240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we use the formula:
   \[
   \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
   \]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

20%"
"To figure out how many books Wendy needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many books can fit in the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ books} \]

Next, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number. So, we need to double 36 and then add 20:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards herself. Her dad also gave her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, and each box had 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Adding the cards Erica made to the pre-made cards, the total number of cards she had initially is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, the total number of cards she passed out is:
\[ 24 + 5 = 29 \]

Subtracting the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had initially, the number of cards she has left is:
\[ 50 - 29 = 21 \]

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends. Adding these to the cards she has left, the total number of cards she now has is:
\[ 21 + 17 = 38 \]

So, the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:
38"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza Bill and Mark each get. 

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
1/3 of 12 = 4 slices for Bill.

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
1/4 of 12 = 3 slices for Mark.

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices herself, so we add those to the slices given away:
7 slices (given away) + 2 slices (eaten by Jenny) = 9 slices.

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original 12 slices:
12 slices - 9 slices = 3 slices.

So, the number of slices left is 3.

"Mark has $50 in his bank account and he earns $10 each day. He wants to buy a bike that costs $300. First, we need to figure out how much more money he needs:

\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \]

So, Mark needs $250 more. Since he earns $10 per day, we can find out how many days he needs to save by dividing the amount he needs by his daily earnings:

\[ 250 \div 10 = 25 \]

So, Mark needs to save for 25 days.

25"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: She saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, let's add up all the bugs:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:
168"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. We know Erica is 30 years old.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is \(30 + 5 = 35\) years old.
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is \(35 + 7 = 42\) years old.

Now, to find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age:
\[ 42 - 30 = 12 \]

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. 

First, we need to figure out how many ounces of milk John drinks. Since he drinks 2 glasses and each glass is 8 ounces, we multiply 2 by 8:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in those 16 ounces of milk. Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, we multiply 16 by 3:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ calories} \]

So, John consumed 48 calories.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to figure out how many days the builder works in a month. The builder works 4 weeks every month, and each week he works 6 days. So, in one month, he works:
   \[
   4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many days he works in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
   \[
   24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to calculate how much he earns in a year. He gets paid $50 for each day he works, so:
   \[
   288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year}
   \]

So, the builder earns $14400 in a year.

"To figure out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed:**
   - The recipe calls for 3 cups of flour for one batch.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups of flour.

2. **Calculate the total amount of milk needed:**
   - The recipe calls for 1 cup of milk for one batch.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups of milk.

3. **Determine how many bags of flour Mark needs to buy:**
   - Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
   - Mark needs 12 cups of flour, so he needs \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour.

4. **Determine how many bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:**
   - Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
   - Mark needs 4 cups of milk, so he needs \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk.

5. **Calculate how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:**
   - Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.
   - The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\).

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"To figure out how much energy Mel will save, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the original daily energy usage:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - So, the daily energy usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time:**
   - If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original and new daily usage:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

4. **Convert the daily energy savings to kilowatt-hours:**
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, the daily energy savings in kilowatt-hours is:
     \[
     \frac{4500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:**
   - The total energy savings over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to add up all the stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

First, let's add up the stripes:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(17 + 17 = 34\)
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the 36-striped zebra: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

Now, let's add all these stripes together:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, we count the total number of zebras:
\[ 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \]

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[ \frac{88}{4} = 22 \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To figure out how much Tyson will spend on the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - There are 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - So, the number of sandwiches needed is \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total meat needed is \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Similarly, the total cheese needed is \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so the total cost for the meat is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \).
   - The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so the total cost for the cheese is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost for both the meat and cheese is \( 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

3. Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so now he has:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

4. He also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis, so he buys:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. Now, let's add up the total number of corns and cannolis:
   \[
   100 \text{ cannolis} + 60 \text{ corns} = 160
   \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
160

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He already walked half of his goal, which is 5,000 steps, to and from school. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

Let's figure out how many steps he took during his jog:

1. Total steps goal: 10,000
2. Steps already taken (to and from school + with friend): 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000
3. Steps left after the jog: 2,000

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we can subtract the steps he had already taken and the steps he had left from his total goal:

10,000 (total goal) - 6,000 (steps already taken) - 2,000 (steps left) = 2,000

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and each page has about 200 words. So, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
\[ 9000 \text{ words} \div 300 \text{ words/minute} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, but it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to leave 10 minutes before his 60-minute deadline:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, we subtract the time it takes him to read from the time he needs to leave:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To figure out how much the company paid the employees in May and June, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total payment for May:
- There were 40 employees.
- Each employee worked 40 hours a week.
- They were paid $15 per hour.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

So, the total payment for one employee in May is:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

For 40 employees, the total payment in May is:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total payment for June:
- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
- The number of employees in June is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

The total payment for one employee in June is the same as in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

For 30 employees, the total payment in June is:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, let's add the payments for May and June to get the total amount paid:
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 168000 \]"
"Sally went to the seashore for vacation and her parents gave her $10 to spend. She bought 2 pounds of taffy that was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound of taffy costs $3, and the second pound costs half of that, which is $1.50. 

The total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that cost $0.25 each. The total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all her expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Tim buys a package of fireworks for $400.
2. He also buys another pack that costs twice as much as the first one. So, the second pack costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of both packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. The discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. After the discount, the total cost of the two packages is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.
7. Adding the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total, the final amount Tim spends is \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Marcy makes 50,000 candles, and she says they are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles might explode. 

To find out how many candles might explode, we calculate 1% of 50,000:

\[ 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

So, 500 candles might explode.

Next, we know that 5% of the candles that might explode also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 

To find out how many of these 500 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog, we calculate 5% of 500:

\[ 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

So, 25 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To figure out the total cost of the blouses Misha picked, we need to follow a few steps:

1. First, find out how much each blouse costs after the 30% discount.
2. Then, multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

The regular price of each blouse is $20. A 30% discount means the price is reduced by 30% of $20.

30% of $20 is calculated as:
\[ 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount is $6 per blouse. Subtract this from the regular price to get the discounted price:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha picked 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price by 4:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let's say Joanne gathers \( x \) apples from the average trees.

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so that's \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so that's \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Now, let's add up the numbers we know:

\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 \]

So, the equation simplifies to:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

We have a herd of camels and dromedaries. We know two things:
1. There are 180 heads in total.
2. There are 304 humps in total.

Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. We need to find out how many dromedaries there are.

Let's use some algebra to solve this. Let:
- \( C \) be the number of camels.
- \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we can set up two equations:
1. The total number of heads:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

**Final Answer:**

"Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. Let's break down the distance he traveled each day to find the total.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - He traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers.

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - He didn't travel at all.
   - Total for this day: 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers.

Now, let's add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

So, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

"Mr. Josue got some money from two banks to help fund his store. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice that amount, which is $8000. He already had $5000 of his own money. To find out how much money he has now, we add all these amounts together:

$5000 (his own money) + $4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in total.

17000"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we start with 50 cats on the rock. Four boats come and each takes 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken by the boats is:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the 20 cats that were taken by the boats from the initial 50 cats:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats run after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we calculate:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Finally, we subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"To figure out how much Bill pays for 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break it down into parts:

1. For the first 6 months, the service costs $8 a month. So, for 6 months, it's:
   \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) dollars.

2. After the first 6 months, the price goes up to $12 a month for the next 8 months. So, for 8 months, it's:
   \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) dollars.

3. After the first 14 months (6 + 8), the price increases to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and he has already paid for 14 months, he has 10 months left at the new price. So, for 10 months, it's:
   \( 10 \times 14 = 140 \) dollars.

Now, we add all these amounts together to get the total cost for 2 years:
\( 48 + 96 + 140 = 284 \) dollars.

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is 284 dollars."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost \(28 - 6 = 22\) dollars.

2. **Total Savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Savings from Each Pair:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Original Prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - So, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - So, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Difference in Original Prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To figure out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to add up the number of employees that each type of vehicle can carry.

First, let's calculate for the buses:
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- There are 4 buses.
- So, 4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees.

Next, for the minibusses:
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- There are 6 minibusses.
- So, 6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees.

Finally, for the minivans:
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- There are 10 minivans.
- So, 10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees.

Now, we add up all the employees that can be transported:
- 240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees.

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"Lillian wants to add some bird feeders to her garden. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, but the ones she made attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones.

First, let's figure out how many birds each type of feeder attracts:
- Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds for each type of feeder:
- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders × 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds.
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders × 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds.

Finally, we add the birds from both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
- Total birds = 60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds.

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner and ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4, and the soup cost 25% more than the bagel. The cake is only half the price of the bagel. Let's figure out how much she had to pay in total.

1. **Bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - 25% of $4 is \(0.25 \times 4 = 1\).
   - So, the soup costs \(4 + 1 = 5\) dollars.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \(4 / 2 = 2\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost: \(4 + 5 + 2 = 11\) dollars.

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He plans to sell the cards for $1.5 each. After selling some of his cards, he keeps 1/3 of them and still has $50 left for spending cash. We need to find out how many cards he started with.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total money needed for the amusement park and spending cash:**
   - Ticket: $100
   - Spending cash: $50
   - Total: $100 + $50 = $150

2. **Money made from selling cards:**
   - Kenny sells the cards for $1.5 each.
   - Let \( C \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells 2/3 of the cards.
   - The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}C \).

3. **Equation for the total money made:**
   - Money made from selling cards: \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C \)
   - This must equal $150:
     \[
     1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 150
     \]

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 1.5 \times \frac{2C}{3} = 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3} \times C = 1 \times C = C
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     C = 150
     \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - So, he prepared 18 guests × 2 hotdogs = 36 hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The other 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared 18 guests × 1 hotdog = 18 hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - So, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is 40 guests × 2 hotdogs = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26 hotdogs ÷ 1 hotdog per guest = 26 guests.

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

26"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Indras has 6 letters in her name.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. The problem says her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

So, we first find half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Then, we add 4 to this number to get the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to get the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Charlotte's order costs after the discount.

First, we need to add up the cost of all the items she wants to buy:
- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Each utensil costs $5.00, and she wants 5 of them, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20):
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

132.00"
"To figure out how much more money Dora needs, we first add up the cost of all the items she wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, we add up the money Dora has:

- Money saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we subtract the total money Dora has from the total cost of the items:

$19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30

"To figure out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Find out how much gas is in one container:**
   - We have 15 gallons of gas divided equally into 5 containers.
   - So, each container has \( \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \).

2. **Determine how much gas Josey needs:**
   - Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container.
   - So, she needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 3 gallons, which is \( \frac{3 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \).

3. **Convert gallons to pints:**
   - There are 8 pints in a gallon.
   - So, 0.75 gallons is \( 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \).

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total Money George Had:**
   - George started with $5.

2. **Money Left After Spending:**
   - He had 1% of his money left, which is \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars.
   - So, the amount he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

4. **Amount Spent on Candy Bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

"To figure out the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Onions:**
   - The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but Antoine likes to double that amount.
   - So, he uses \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.
   - Onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound.
   - The cost for the onions is \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pound} = 8 \text{ dollars}\).

2. **Beef Stock:**
   - He needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - Each box is on sale for $2.00.
   - The cost for the beef stock is \(2 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 4 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for all the ingredients is \(8 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Cost per Serving:**

   - Wayne's hotel is close to the theater, and it takes him 4 minutes to get there.

2. **Bernadette's Drive Time:**
   - Bernadette's drive time is four times longer than Wayne's.
   - So, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \), Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.

4. **Bernadette's Departure Time:**
   - Since Bernadette's drive time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).
   - So, Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

5. **Wayne's Departure Time:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive time is 4 minutes).

6. **Difference in Departure Times:**

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet**: Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.
2. **Find the width of the room**: We know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
   \]
   Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   360 = 9 \times \text{Width}
   \]
   Solving for the width:
   \[
   \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. **Calculate the perimeter**: The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet}

"To figure out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack has 20 beads.
- So, Elizabeth's total beads = (1 pack * 20 beads/pack) + (2 packs * 20 beads/pack) = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack has 20 beads.
- So, Margareth's total beads = (3 packs * 20 beads/pack) + (4 packs * 20 beads/pack) = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:

"Alright, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: When Marcus wakes up, the house is 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking**:
   - Marcus bakes for 3 hours.
   - Each hour, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees.
   - So, the total temperature increase from baking is \(3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Temperature After Baking**:
   - Initial temperature: 40 degrees
   - Temperature increase from baking: 15 degrees
   - Total temperature after baking: \(40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}\)

4. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window**:
   - Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - So, the total cooling is \(30 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

5. **Final Temperature**:
   - Temperature after baking: 55 degrees
   - Temperature decrease from opening the window: 6 degrees

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH).
   - Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles

2. **Determine the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   - The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs.
   - For 16 miles, the horse will eat:
   - Hay needed = 16 miles × 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails of hay

3. **Calculate the cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Total cost = 8 bails × $3 per bail = $24

4. **Determine the total amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six 5-dollar bills.
   - Total money = 6 bills × $5 per bill = $30

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total. She has 4 dozen eggs from the cases and 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen would be:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass requires 5 eggs, so:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the number of trays she can put out is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many crayons are in the six packets that each have eight crayons. We do this by multiplying the number of packets by the number of crayons in each packet:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, we need to find out how many crayons are in the four packets that each have sixteen crayons. We do this by multiplying the number of packets by the number of crayons in each packet:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total number of crayons:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayons.

112"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - You get one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1.
   - So, the total cost with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

2. **Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The regular movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let's call the cost of the popcorn \( P \).

   So, the total cost without the super ticket is $12 + $3 + \( P \) = $15 + \( P \).

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.

   So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   15 + P = 21 - 2
   \]
   \[
   15 + P = 19
   \]
   \[
   P = 19 - 15
   \]
   \[
   P = 4
   \]

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To figure out how much Bentley paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find out how much it cost to fill one balloon before the price went up. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we divide 900 by 20:
   \[
   \text{Cost per balloon before increase} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out the new cost per balloon after the price increase. The price went up by $20, so we add 20 to the original cost:
   \[
   \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Finally, we calculate how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost per balloon by 170:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Bentley paid:
\[
11050

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to figure out the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]
- For the second part, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, let's add these distances to get the total distance:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to find the total time for the trip:
\[
\text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Finally, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:

\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:

\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies she gets is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, Jenna has:

- 5 sapphires left (since she traded 3 out of her 8)
- 2 rubies

The value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

The value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

The total value of all her jewels is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy also eats 4 apples a day. So together, they eat:
4 apples/day (Marin) + 4 apples/day (Nancy) = 8 apples/day

Now, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of apples they eat per day by the number of days:
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

So, Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days.

240"
"To figure out how much potting soil Bob needs and how much it will cost, we need to do a few calculations.

First, let's find out the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (like a raised bed) is found by multiplying the length, width, and height. Each raised bed is 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall.

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we need to find the total volume of soil for all the beds:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil Bob will need. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each bag costs $12:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the potting soil is:
1920"
"To figure out the total number of cards, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - So, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, let's add up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

"To figure out the percentage of puppies that have spots, we need to add up all the puppies and all the spotted puppies, and then do a bit of math.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

First, let's add up all the puppies:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, let's add up all the spotted puppies:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the percentage of spotted puppies, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

First, we calculate the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, we convert it to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
35%"
"To figure out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   - **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Add up the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much Grayson earns from the cans and bottles each week.

1. **Cans:**
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
   - Each can is worth 2 cents.
   - So, the weekly earnings from cans = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

2. **Bottles:**
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
   - Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - So, the weekly earnings from bottles = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Next, we add the earnings from cans and bottles to get the total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

Now, we need to find out how much Grayson earns in a four-week month:
- Total monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many plants Toni has, we need to calculate 60% of 10 and add that to 10.

60% of 10 is:
\[ 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \] plants.

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks, and each deck has 25 cards. So, we multiply:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards she has. She has 5 boxes, and each box has 40 cards. So, we multiply:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the number of basketball cards and baseball cards to get the total number of cards:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cards} \]

Each student gets 10 cards. To find out how many students there are, we divide the remaining cards by 10:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Becky paid for her apples:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.45 = 9\) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount.
- Therefore, the total cost after the discount is \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10% discount.
- The discount amount is \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- Therefore, the total cost after the discount is \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many of each item are in one room:
- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up all the items in one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total items in one room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 items.

Since there are 80 rooms, we multiply the total items in one room by 80:
15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items.

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200.

"Alright, let's figure this out step by step.

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. We need to find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat.

Let's call the number of carrot sticks \( c \).

According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To figure out what percentage of the shark's body length the remoras take up, we need to do a bit of math. First, we need to make sure all our measurements are in the same unit. The shark is 10 feet long, and each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the remoras' lengths to feet:

6 inches = 0.5 feet (because 6 / 12 = 0.5)

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we have the combined length of the remoras, which is 1 foot. The shark is 10 feet long. To find the percentage, we use the formula:

(Length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

So, we plug in the numbers:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To figure out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we need to use a bit of math. Here’s how we can break it down:

1. First, we know there are 9 kids allergic to dairy and 6 kids allergic to peanuts. But 3 kids are allergic to both, so they are counted in both groups.

2. To avoid counting the 3 kids who are allergic to both twice, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, and then subtract the 3 kids who are counted in both groups:
   - Kids allergic to dairy: 9
   - Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
   - Kids allergic to both: 3
   - Total kids allergic to either or both: 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

3. Now, we know that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the 12 kids from the total number of kids in the class:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to get the combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is:

"Okay, so Keegan and Tashay are trying to raise $200 for their baseball camp. By 3 pm, Keegan has earned $83 and Tashay has earned $91. To find out how much more they need to earn, we add what they've already made and then subtract that from their goal.

So, $83 + $91 = $174. That's how much they've made so far.

Now, we subtract that from their goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Gabriel has 20 songs on his media player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. So, we calculate how many songs Luri has:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Now, both Gabriel and Luri have media players that can hold up to 100 songs. We need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

1. First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them.
   \[
   \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]

2. Next, we need to calculate how much money Stetson gave up. He gives up $10 for each orange he eats.
   \[
   \text{Total amount of money} = 24 \times 10 = 240
   \]

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Jillian's shoes cost $80. The problem says her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. So, we need to find out what 3 times the cost of her shoes is, and then subtract $20 from that.

1. Calculate 3 times the cost of the shoes:
   \[
   3 \times 80 = 240
   \]

2. Subtract $20 from that amount to find the cost of the handbag:
   \[
   240 - 20 = 220
   \]

So, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

220"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles each day for 5 days a week. So, we multiply 12 miles by 5 days:

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends running each week. We know he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours, we divide the total miles by his speed:

60 miles / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours

So, James runs 6 hours a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Daily Oats Consumption for One Horse:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - So, one horse eats 5 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. **Daily Oats Consumption for Four Horses:**
   - If one horse eats 10 pounds/day, then four horses eat 10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Total Oats Consumption for Five Days:**
   - If the horses eat 40 pounds/day, then for five days they will eat 40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. **Number of 50-Pound Bags Needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total pounds by the pounds per bag: 200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Jana has 27 puppies. Two-thirds of these puppies are Pomeranians. To find out how many Pomeranians she has, we need to calculate two-thirds of 27.

\[ \text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. One-third of the Pomeranians are girls. To find this, we calculate one-third of 18.

\[ \text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to add up the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21°F.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3°F.

First, let's add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 ÷ 3 = -10

So, the average highest temperature of these 3 countries is -10°F.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is:
   \[
   24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs}
   \]
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.
4. To find out how many eggs won't fit on the trays, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs:
   \[
   64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs}

"Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are on sale for buy one get one free, and she has a $2.00 coupon. She buys 2 packs of razors. Let's figure out how much each razor costs after the discounts.

1. First, let's find out how much 2 packs of razors would normally cost:
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - So, 2 packs would cost $4.00 x 2 = $8.00.

2. Now, with the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack when she buys 2:
   - So, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00.

3. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so we subtract that from the cost:
   - $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. Now, let's find out how many razors she gets:
   - Each pack has 4 razors, and she gets 2 packs.
   - So, she gets 4 razors x 2 = 8 razors.

5. Finally, to find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
   - $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

Since we need the answer in cents, $0.25 is 25 cents.

So, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To figure out how tall the human pyramid is, we need to add up the heights of all the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and going up to the top.

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add up all these heights to get the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Charisma works for 8 hours each day.
2. She takes a 5-minute walk every hour.
3. So, in one day, she takes 8 walks (one for each hour she works).
4. Each walk is 5 minutes long, so in one day, she walks for:
   \[ 8 \text{ walks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]
5. She works for 5 days, so over 5 days, she walks for:
   \[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked for 200 minutes.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.
3. The problem says that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, in four years, Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.
4. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from her age in four years: 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"Paul drives his car twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for 14 days. Each morning ride costs him $6, and each afternoon ride costs him $2. To find out how much he spent in total, we need to add up the costs of all his rides.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- He drives in the morning for 14 days, and each ride costs $6.
- So, the total cost for the morning rides is 14 days * $6/day = $84.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- He drives in the afternoon for 14 days, and each ride costs $2.
- So, the total cost for the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2/day = $28.

Now, we add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to get the total amount spent:
- Total cost = $84 (morning) + $28 (afternoon) = $112.

So, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes, and each box has 10 oranges. So, we multiply:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, we add 20 to the number of oranges Ashley brought:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to get the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we need to know how many oranges are needed for one pie. Each pie needs 3 oranges. So, we divide the total number of oranges by 3:

"To figure out how many guests are needed for the two venues to cost the same, we need to set up an equation. Let's call the number of guests \( x \).

For the first venue:
- There's a flat fee of $200.
- Plus, it costs $5 for food per guest.
- So, the total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second venue:
- It costs $25 per guest, and food is included.
- So, the total cost for the second venue is \( 25x \).

We want to find out when these two costs are the same, so we set the equations equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 20x \]
2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests needed for the two venues to cost the same is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi together collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) be the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have these equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Now, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much yarn Mariah and her grandma used together. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4. So, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{2}{4} \).

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

This means they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn together.

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, the length of the couch is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}

"To figure out the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost and Sticks per Type of Wood:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To get the most sticks, Frederick should buy the cheapest option, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

4. **Calculating the Number of 2 x 4 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

So, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed. Since each pair covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Now, we know that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

So, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of these bus trips. Each bus trip costs $2.20. So, the total cost for 10 trips is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, let's look at the cost of the weekly bus pass. The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

To find out how much Janet would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the bus pass from the total cost of the bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 \text{ per week} - \$20.00 \text{ per week} = \$2.00 \text{ per week} \]

So, Janet would save:

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. The problem says that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. 

First, let's find out how many onions Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times what Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{(number of onions Sophia bought)} = 12 \]

To find the number of onions Sophia bought, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, let's find out how many potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 4 potatoes and that's 4 times what Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{(number of potatoes Sophia bought)} = 4 \]

To find the number of potatoes Sophia bought, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

"To figure out how many calories Andy needs to cut each day to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, we need to do a few calculations. Here’s how we can break it down:

1. **Find out how many days Andy has until his birthday:**
   - Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st.
   - January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days.
   - February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
   - March has 31 days.
   - April has 30 days.
   - May has 31 days.
   - June has 30 days.
   - July 1 to July 19 is 19 days.
   - Adding these up: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

2. **Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds:**
   - It takes about 3500 calories to lose 1 pound.
   - So, for 30 pounds: 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

3. **Determine the daily calorie deficit:**
   - To find out how many calories Andy needs to cut each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days.
   - Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

So, Andy needs to have a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We know that the house costs three times as much as the lot. Let's call the cost of the lot \( L \) and the cost of the house \( H \).

So, we have:
\[ H = 3L \]

And the total cost is:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 3L \) into the total cost equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]

"To figure out how much profit Tara made, we need to do a few calculations:

1. First, find out how many canvas bags Tara bought in total. She bought 8 packs, and each pack has 5 bags.
   \[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

2. Next, calculate the total cost of the canvas bags. Each pack costs $4, and she bought 8 packs.
   \[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Then, calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each bag for $8.
   \[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Finally, to find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total revenue.
   \[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tara's profit is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
2. Each round in the fight lasts 3 minutes.
3. There are 5 rounds in total.

First, we need to find out how many minutes the entire fight lasts:
5 rounds * 3 minutes per round = 15 minutes

Next, we calculate the total number of punches Joe throws in the entire fight:
25 punches per minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches

So, Joe throws 375 punches in the fight.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cookies Josh made} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Next, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cookies Kelsie made} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much money Ali has in total. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, we calculate:

- Four $10 bills: \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars
- Six $20 bills: \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Half of 160 dollars is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after giving 80 dollars to his sister, Ali has:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 80 dollars to buy dinner. To find out how much he spends on dinner, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. First, we need to convert that time into minutes because the final answer needs to be in minutes.

1 hour = 60 minutes, so:
2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes

Now, the problem says that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find out what double Rob's time is and then add 40 minutes to that.

Double Rob's time:
2 × 120 minutes = 240 minutes

Now, add the extra 40 minutes:
240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle the house.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Martha is making winter wear for her 3 grandchildren, and each grandchild needs a hat, a scarf, a sweater, mittens, and socks. Here’s how much wool she needs for each item:

- A hat takes 2 skeins of wool.
- A scarf takes 4 skeins of wool.
- A sweater takes 12 skeins of wool.
- A pair of mittens takes 1 skein of wool.
- A pair of socks takes 2 skeins of wool.

First, let's add up the total number of skeins needed for one grandchild:
- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total for one grandchild:
2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we need to multiply the total for one grandchild by 3:
21 skeins/child × 3 children = 63 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

"Alright, let's figure out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday.

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
   - Remaining problems: \(100 - 12 = 88\)

3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
   - Problems completed on Tuesday: \(3 \times 12 = 36\)
   - Remaining problems: \(88 - 36 = 52\)

4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems.
   - Problems completed on Wednesday: \(\frac{52}{4} = 13\)
   - Remaining problems: \(52 - 13 = 39\)

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - So, Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
   - So, Kathy picks 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - So, Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

5. **Total picking rate:**
   - To find the total, we add up the quarts picked by each person:
   - Total = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
   - Total = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning.
2. They sold 93 loaves in the morning.
3. They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.
4. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

First, we need to find out how many loaves were sold in total:
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Next, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (baked) - 132 (sold) = 68 loaves left

Finally, we add the 6 loaves that were returned:
68 (left) + 6 (returned) = 74 loaves

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is:
74"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips, and each row can fit 6 red tulips. So, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ tulips per row}} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips, and each row can fit 8 blue tulips. So, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ tulips per row}} = 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} \]

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips to get the total number of rows:

\[ 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers.

"Heather has a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins. She wants to divide these raisins equally among making oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. 

First, we need to figure out how many cups of raisins she will use for the oatmeal cookies. Since she's dividing the raisins equally among three things, we divide 27 cups by 3:

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \text{ cups} \]

So, Heather will use 9 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies. Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we divide the 9 cups by 3/4:

\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To figure out how much more Ada will pay on her electric bill after adding the new device, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate how much Ada pays for electricity each day right now:
- Ada uses 12 kilowatts per hour.
- The cost is $1.50 per kilowatt per hour.
- So, her daily cost is 12 * 1.50 = $18.

Next, let's figure out the cost of the new device:
- The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour.
- The cost is $1.50 per kilowatt per hour.
- So, the daily cost for the new device is 2 * 1.50 = $3.

Now, let's add the cost of the new device to Ada's current daily cost:
- Current daily cost: $18
- New device daily cost: $3
- Total daily cost after adding the device: $18 + $3 = $21

To find out the weekly cost, we multiply the daily cost by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
- Current weekly cost: $18 * 7 = $126
- Weekly cost after adding the device: $21 * 7 = $147

Finally, to find the difference in the weekly cost:
- Difference: $147 - $126 = $21

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

21"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they can paint a whole house in 10 days (since 5 days is for half the house).
2. Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, we need to figure out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
   \[
   10 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 240 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. If 5 people are working together, they can paint the house faster. Since 5 people are working, we divide the total hours by 5:
   \[
   240 \text{ hours} \div 5 = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Ophelia's Sofas and Chairs:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - She has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so if she has 20 sofas, she must have 22 chairs (because 20 + 2 = 22).

2. **Jenna's Chairs:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Since Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

3. **Jenna's Sofas:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Since Jenna has 66 chairs, she must have 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

4. **Total Number of Sofas and Chairs:**
   - Ophelia's total: 20 sofas + 22 chairs = 42 items.
   - Jenna's total: 64 sofas + 66 chairs = 130 items.
   - Combined total: 42 + 130 = 172 items.

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Tom bought a CD for $4.
2. He also bought a headphone set.
3. In total, he paid $48.

First, we need to find out how much the headphone set cost. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid:

\[
48 - 4 = 44
\]

So, the headphone set cost $44.

Next, we need to figure out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the $44 by the cost of one CD:

\[
44 \div 4 = 11
\]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"Okay, let's figure out how many hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks.

1. Josh usually works out for 4 hours each week.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out for 4 hours:
- He worked out for 4 hours for 5 weeks.
- So, \( 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours:
- He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks.
- So, \( 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \).

Then, let's calculate the total hours for the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours:
- He worked out for 6 hours for 1 week.
- So, \( 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Now, let's add all these hours together:
- \( 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \).

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 36 \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off the bus. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The new total number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off the bus. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer means:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The new total number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - So, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).

4. **Cousin's Current Age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Age Difference Now:**
   - The current age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The computer costs $1,100.
2. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.
3. The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
4. The total amount spent is $2,400, so the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
5. Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

3. Each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's calculate the number of seashells each girl brought:

- Number of seashells each boy brought: 60
- Number of seashells each girl brought: 60 (from the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the boys' shells)
- Number of seashells each girl brought: 60 + 240 = 300

"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books together:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Let's do the addition:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

1. The total bill for the dinner is $50.
2. Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 bill.
3. First, calculate the 20% tip:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10

   So, the tip is $10.
4. Add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60

   The total amount is $60.
5. Since the check is split evenly, each person pays half of the original bill:
   \[
   50 \div 2 = 25
   \]
   So, each person pays $25 for the bill.
6. However, you are responsible for the entire tip, which is $10.
7. Therefore, the total amount you need to pay is:

"To figure out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total savings goal for April:** $1125
2. **Number of days in April:** 30 days
3. **First half of April:** 15 days
4. **Second half of April:** 15 days

Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Let's call the amount he saves each day in the first half \( x \).

- **Total savings in the first half:** \( 15x \)
- **Amount saved each day in the second half:** \( 2x \)
- **Total savings in the second half:** \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

Now, we can set up the equation for the total savings:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]

\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half. Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

- For the oranges: 5 oranges * $0.80 each = $4.00
- For the peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75 each = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:

- Total cost = $4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20.00, so we subtract the total cost from what she gave:

- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

"Okay, let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend on all the items he wants to buy.

First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item:
- Notebooks: 5 notebooks at $1.50 each = 5 * 1.50 = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens at $0.25 each = 2 * 0.25 = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator at $12.00 each = 1 * 12.00 = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set at $10.00 each = 1 * 10.00 = $10.00

Next, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find the discount amount:
- Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * 30.00 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
- Total cost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

So, Daniel has to spend:
$27.00"
"To figure out how much change Carly gets, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought and then subtract that total from the fifty-dollar bill she gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers:
- 5 hamburgers at $4 each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars

Next, the cost of the potato fries:
- 10 packs of fries at $0.30 each: \(10 \times 0.30 = 3\) dollars

Then, the cost of the fruit drinks:
- 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Total cost: \(20 + 3 + 10 = 33\) dollars

Finally, subtract the total cost from the fifty-dollar bill:
- Change: \(50 - 33 = 17\) dollars

So, Carly gets back 17 dollars in change.

17"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Antonella earned from her sales.

First, we need to understand the commission structure:
- For the first $1000 in sales, she gets a 30% commission.
- For any sales over $1000, she gets an additional 10% commission.

Now, let's break it down:

1. **First $1000 in sales:**
   - Commission: 30% of $1000
   - Calculation: \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \)

2. **Sales over $1000:**
   - Amount over $1000: \( 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \)
   - Commission: 10% of $1500
   - Calculation: \( 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \)

3. **Total commission:**
   - Add the two amounts together: \( 300 + 150 = 450 \)

So, Antonella earned $450.

450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Bill has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, Bill has 70 guests, and he wants to give each guest 2 bottles of water. So, the total number of bottles he needs is:
\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, to find out how many more bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

92"
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. 

First, let's figure out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to that gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, in warm water, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions:
- In cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
- In warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water:
- The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much John earns in a week. He works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, so:

5 hours/day * 4 days/week = 20 hours/week

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $2 per hour, so:

20 hours/week * $2/hour = $40/week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80. We divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The cost of a foot-long fish sub is $40.
2. The cost of a six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. So, we multiply $40 by 3:
   \[
   40 \times 3 = 120
   \]
3. Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

"To figure out the total number of holes in all the buttons, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know there are 21 buttons in total.
2. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each.
3. The rest of the buttons, which is 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, have 4 holes each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes:

- For the 7 buttons with 2 holes each: 7 * 2 = 14 holes
- For the 14 buttons with 4 holes each: 14 * 4 = 56 holes

Adding these together gives us the total number of holes:
14 + 56 = 70 holes

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
70"
"To figure out how big Peter's locker is, we need to start with the size of Timothy's locker and work our way down.

1. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
2. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, so we divide 24 by 2:
   \[
   24 \div 2 = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's, so we divide 12 by 4:
   \[
   12 \div 4 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

"To figure out the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to add up the number of hamsters and guinea pigs. There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.

First, calculate the total number of hamsters:
3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

Next, calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Susan weighs. Mark weighs 150 pounds, and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. So, we subtract 20 from 150:

\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \]

So, Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. So, we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

\[ 130 \times 2 = 260 \]

So, Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. We add their weights together:

\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]

Finally, to find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:

\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

180"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial Angle**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves 5 degrees up every hour.

3. **Total Movement**: If the sun moves for 10 hours, it will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle**: To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle to the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"James has two sons, one who is 12 years old and the other who is 4 years younger. So, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

To find out how many candles James needs, we add the ages of both sons:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack of candles has 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Now, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
4 * 3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles.

"To figure out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total time she spent reading in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert this reading time into pages. Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads per minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let \( N \) be the nephew's current age, in 7 years, the nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):

1. Distribute the 3 on the right side:
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

2. Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with \( N \):
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave her $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of what she got for each of the previous three teeth. Since she got $1.00 for each of those, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Richie scored 80 goals. The problem says that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, to find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's total:
80 - 20 = 60 goals for Mark.

Next, the problem also says that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's total:
80 - 45 = 35 goals for Anna.

Now, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up their individual scores:
80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175 goals.

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175.

"Okay, let's figure out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week.

1. **Calculate the daily spending:**
   - Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days).
   - Daily spending = $70 ÷ 7 = $10 per day.

2. **Calculate the spending on wooden action figures:**
   - From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures.
   - Total spent on wooden action figures = $10/day × 4 days = $40.
   - Each wooden action figure costs $5.
   - Number of wooden action figures = $40 ÷ $5 = 8 figures.

3. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   - Total money left after buying wooden action figures = $70 - $40 = $30.

4. **Calculate the spending on plastic action figures:**
   - From Thursday to Saturday, he spends $10 each day on plastic action figures.
   - Total spent on plastic action figures = $10/day × 3 days = $30.
   - Each plastic action figure costs $2.
   - Number of plastic action figures = $30 ÷ $2 = 15 figures.

5. **Calculate the total number of action figures:**
   - Total action figures = 8 wooden figures + 15 plastic figures = 23 figures.

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have 23 action figures.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many roses Ford needs to supply to all the flower shops each week. 

- The first shop orders 20 roses.
- The second shop orders 15 roses.
- The third shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses needed per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Next, we need to find out how many roses are needed in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's see how many roses Ford can grow in a month. He grows 40 roses every week, so:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the number of roses he can grow from the number of roses needed:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To figure out the net profit, we need to look at how much it costs to make the sandwiches and how much money they make from selling them.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
   - So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.

3. **Total Cost for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
   - Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

4. **Revenue from Selling 10 Sandwiches:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
   - So, the revenue from 10 sandwiches is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

5. **Net Profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

   - Area = 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

2. **Cost of the new carpet:**
   - The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
   - Cost of new carpet = 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2,592.

3. **Cost of the padding:**
   - The padding costs $2 per square foot.
   - Cost of padding = 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432.

4. **Cost to remove the old carpet:**

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out by what percentage the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, so the difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is off by 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to if she wants it to reach 520 degrees. If the oven is off by 4%, then the actual temperature will be 4% higher than the set temperature. Let's call the temperature she should set the oven to \( x \).

The actual temperature will be:

\[ x + 0.04x = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.04:

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To figure out how long it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add up the time for each movie. 

First, let's convert the time of each movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes together:
- 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch both movies.

"Herb told me he paid $76,000 for his house. If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we need to figure out what 30% of $76,000 is and then subtract that from $76,000 to find out how much Juan's house is worth.

First, let's find 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Now, subtract that amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200. To find the total value of both houses combined, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The combined value of the two houses is:
\[ 129,200 \]"

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out the cost of one box of contacts with the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there's a 10% discount. So, the discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

So, one box of contacts costs $90.00 after the discount.

Pete is buying 2 boxes, so the total cost is:
\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single-use contacts, so 2 boxes contain:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Pete uses 2 contacts per day, so the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 2.00 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours Jill worked:
- On Saturday, Jill worked 2 hours.
- On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour.
So, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many hours John worked:
- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate how much each of them earned:
- Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, to find out how much more John earned compared to Jill:
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns in total. She does aerobics for 2 hours, and each hour she burns 500 calories. So for aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

Next, she runs for 1 hour, and during that time she burns 600 calories. So for running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we need to find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories. We can set up a proportion:

100 ml / 200 calories = x ml / 1600 calories

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:
x = (100 ml * 1600 calories) / 200 calories
x = 160000 ml / 200
x = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We know that the jar contains red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar tells us:
- There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
- There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

Then:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Now, solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500.

Next, we find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Jared is trying to increase his typing speed. He starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to improve and increases his speed by another 5 WPM, we need to find the average of the three measurements.

First, let's find the third measurement:
- Initial speed: 47 WPM
- After lessons: 52 WPM
- After another increase: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Now, we have the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add these three numbers together and then divide by 3:
\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52

"If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would lose:
\[ 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \]

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would gain:
\[ 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we add the weight loss and the weight gain:
\[ 6.25 \text{ pounds} + 8.75 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how many seats Alex will need for her event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people will bring 2 friends.
   - So, the number of friends coming is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Total from Email Invitations:**
   - The total number of people from the email invitations is \(100 + 200 = 300\).

3. **Phone Calls:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - So, the number of spouses coming is \(8 \times 1 = 8\).

4. **Total from Phone Calls:**
   - The total number of people from the phone calls is \(10 + 8 = 18\).

5. **Total Number of Seats Needed:**
   - Adding the totals from the email invitations and the phone calls gives us \(300 + 18 = 318\).

So, Alex will need 318 seats.

"To figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than Mark's window, we need to keep doubling the height of the beanstalk each day until it's more than 20 feet tall. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's break it down:

- **Day 0:** The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1:** The beanstalk doubles to 4 * 2 = 8 feet.
- **Day 2:** The beanstalk doubles again to 8 * 2 = 16 feet.
- **Day 3:** The beanstalk doubles once more to 16 * 2 = 32 feet.

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To figure out how many grams of protein John gets from eating mushrooms every week, we can break it down step by step:

1. **Find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein.
   - So, 200 grams of mushrooms would have \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) grams of protein.

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - Therefore, he gets 6 grams of protein each day.

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total protein intake per week is \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams.

John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Let's call Jerry's current age \( J \).

So, 5 years ago, Jerry was \( J - 5 \) years old.

According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice what he was 5 years ago:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

Add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To figure out how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants needs a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - So, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Subtract the deposit George has already paid:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle \( x \). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \). Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the sum of the angles:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we need to find the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to add up all the money he has and then divide by the cost of one gumball. Each gumball costs 5 cents, so let's start by converting all his coins into cents.

- Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add all these up to find the total amount of money Colby has:

200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs he can buy:

345 cents ÷ 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To figure out the total number of legs, we need to think about how many legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal in the pet store.

- Dogs have 4 legs. There are 5 dogs, so \(5 \times 4 = 20\) legs from the dogs.
- Cats also have 4 legs. There are 2 cats, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) legs from the cats.
- Birds have 2 legs. There are 10 birds, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs from the birds.

Now, we add up all the legs:
\[20 \text{ (from dogs)} + 8 \text{ (from cats)} + 20 \text{ (from birds)} = 48\]

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. If Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, then in one hour, he makes:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate how many pounds each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. So, he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday. So, he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:
- Monday: $8

"To figure out how much money Patrick made, we need to break it down into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he made \(15 \times 0.50 = 7.50\) dollars.
- Over four hours, he made \(7.50 \times 4 = 30\) dollars.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he made \(10 \times 0.60 = 6\) dollars.
- Over two hours, he made \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Now, we add the money he made in both parts:
- Total money made = \(30 + 12 = 42\) dollars.

So, Patrick earned 42 dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To figure out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Find out how many rotations the tires make in one month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - So, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations in one year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the number of rotations in one year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}

3. **Determine how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:**
   - The tires can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before they need to be replaced.
   - So, the number of years is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
2. The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo, which gives you 120 washes.
3. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes because she's using half the amount of shampoo per wash.

So, if 2 pumps give 120 washes, 1 pump will give:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes} \]

Now, we need to find out how much each pump costs. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, and it provides 240 pumps.

To find the cost per pump:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:
\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 10 \text{ cents} \]

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Now, we apply the 30% discount, which means Joe pays 70% of the total cost:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50, and he spends $42, so the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To figure out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to do a few calculations.

First, let's find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- It costs $194 per meter to repave.
- So, the cost to repave Monica's street is \( 150 \times 194 = 29100 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- It costs $194 per meter to repave.
- So, the cost to repave Lewis' street is \( 490 \times 194 = 95060 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

"John got $100,000 to start his research on identifying cancer cells, which was supposed to last for 5 months. But his research took 10 times longer, so it ended up taking 50 months in total. For the first 5 months, he used the $100,000. For the extra 45 months, each month cost 50% more than the initial monthly cost.

First, let's figure out how much he spent each month for the first 5 months:
- $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month

For the next 45 months, each month cost 50% more:
- $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the extra 45 months:
- $30,000 * 45 months = $1,350,000

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the extra 45 months:
- $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

So, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each beef tip is 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the total ounces of meat:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to know how many days are in March. March has 31 days.

Next, we know that there are 1000 members in the Reddit group, and each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

To find out how many posts are made in one day, we multiply the number of members by the number of posts each member makes:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find out how many posts are made in the entire month of March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March:

"Okay, let's break down the costs step by step to find out how much Scarlett spent in total.

1. **Aquarium**: $10.00
2. **Bags of rocks**: 2 bags at $2.50 each
   - 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. **Pieces of coral**: 3 pieces at $2.00 each
   - 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. **Fish**: 20 fish at $0.50 each
   - 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. **Fish food**: $2.00

Now, let's add all these amounts together:

- Aquarium: $10.00
- Bags of rocks: $5.00
- Pieces of coral: $6.00
- Fish: $10.00
- Fish food: $2.00

Total cost:
$10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. In the second week, it doubled in height. So, 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches.
3. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. So, 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches.

The beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much meat Prince sells in one day. He sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, we multiply 15 kg by 10 hours:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all 750 kg of meat from the bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many seats there are in total. The auditorium has 4 rows, and each row has 18 seats. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many seats were taken by the administrators. The problem says one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we subtract the seats taken by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats are left:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Then, we need to find out how many of these remaining seats were taken by the parents. The problem states that one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Finally, we subtract the seats taken by the parents from the remaining seats to find out how many seats were taken by the students:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats} \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ 36 \]

   - Each pole has 4 street lights.
   - Each intersection has 6 poles.
   - So, the total number of street lights at one intersection is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

2. **Calculate the total number of street lights for all intersections:**
   - There are 4 intersections.
   - So, the total number of street lights for all intersections is \(24 \times 4 = 96\).

3. **Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights:**
   - There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
   - So, the total number of functioning street lights is \(96 - 20 = 76\).

The total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"To figure out how many more times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to do a bit of subtraction and addition.

First, let's look at the first DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times in total.
- It has already been played 356 times.
- So, the number of times it can still be played is \(1000 - 356 = 644\) times.

Next, let's look at the second DVD:
- It can also be played 1000 times in total.
- It has already been played 135 times.
- So, the number of times it can still be played is \(1000 - 135 = 865\) times.

Now, to find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining plays of both DVDs:
- Total remaining plays: \(644 + 865 = 1509\)

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Gum Chewing at School:**
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours.
   - The school day lasts 8 hours.
   - So, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum during school.

2. **Gum Chewing After School:**
   - He chews 1 piece on the way home.
   - He chews 1 piece after dinner.
   - So, he chews 1 + 1 = 2 pieces after school.

3. **Total Pieces Chewed:**
   - During school: 4 pieces
   - After school: 2 pieces
   - Total: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces

4. **Remaining Pieces Before Giving to Sister:**
   - Jim starts with 20 pieces.
   - He chews 6 pieces.
   - So, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

5. **Giving Half to His Sister:**
   - He gives half of the remaining 14 pieces to his sister.
   - Half of 14 is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces.

So, at the end of the day, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left.

First, we need to figure out how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs, and each baseball costs $3. So, we multiply 9 by 3:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]
So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, we need to figure out how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs, and each basketball costs $14. So, we multiply 8 by 14:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]
So, the basketball coach spent $112.

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:
\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

"To figure out Ashley's internet speed in Mb per hour, we need to do a few steps:

1. First, we need to know how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   \[ 60 \times 60 = 3600 \text{ seconds in an hour} \]

2. Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. To find out how many kb she can download in an hour, we multiply her speed by the number of seconds in an hour:
   \[ 20 \text{ kb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds} = 72000 \text{ kb} \]

3. Now, we need to convert kb to Mb. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000:
   \[ 72000 \text{ kb} \div 1000 = 72 \text{ Mb} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, we need to know how tall Adam has to be to ride the roller coaster. The requirement is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 4 feet to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know Adam's current height is 40 inches. We need to find out how many more inches he needs to grow to reach 48 inches:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Adam grows 2 inches every year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by his annual growth rate:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total Sales:**
   James sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000.
   \[
   \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total sales minus the total acquisition cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{James's Commission} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of riders**: There are 100 riders.
2. **Percentage of riders who can stay upright**: 25% of the riders can stay upright.
   - To find 25% of 100, we calculate:
     \[
     100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders}
     \]
3. **Percentage of these riders who are women**: 60% of the 25 riders who can stay upright are women.
   - To find 60% of 25, we calculate:
     \[
     25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women}
     \]
4. **Number of men who can stay upright**: To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.
   - So, we calculate:

     \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond jewell is given as $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the price of a diamond jewell. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold jewell. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels:
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
   \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is \(4800\)."
"Max bought some stamps at the post office. He got 16 snowflake stamps. He also got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he got 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he got 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. 

To find out how many stamps Max bought in total, we add up all the stamps:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

So, Max bought 45 stamps in all.

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to look at how much faster Tom is going compared to Bob and then see how long it takes to close the 75-mile gap.

Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. So, Tom is catching up at a speed of:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to cover the 75-mile gap at 15 miles per hour. We can use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents said if the cost per class goes over $10, they won't sign him up again. There are 10 total classes. We need to figure out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class goes over $10.

First, let's find out the cost per class if he attends all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, if Manny misses some classes, the cost per class will go up. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class hits $10.

Let's say Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class will be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We want this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Then, we divide both sides by -10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class goes over $10.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Jewel processes 50 customers each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie works twice as fast as Jewel. So, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

For a week, Julie processes:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week, we add their weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

   - Paisley ran 4 miles.

2. **Reggie's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran.
   - So, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

3. **Lynn's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn.
   - Let's say Lynn ran \( L \) miles.
   - According to the problem, \( 20 = L + 3 \).

4. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: \( L = 20 - 3 \)
   - So, \( L = 17 \).

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To figure out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much one apple and one orange cost.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - So, one apple costs \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - So, one orange costs \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Five apples cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Five oranges cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total amount Clyde will pay.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Total cost = \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

"To figure out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to first find out how much dirt he needs to move. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. 

To find the volume of the hole, we multiply the length by the width by the depth:
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. So, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel each cubic foot:
\[ \text{Total time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"Okay, let's break down the cost of Bill's new truck step by step.

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. So, 
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats. So,
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500

"Tim gets a 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary and a bonus worth half a month's salary. Let's figure out how much he will make in a year.

First, we calculate the 5% raise:
5% of $20,000 is $20,000 * 0.05 = $1,000.

So, his new monthly salary is:
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half of his new monthly salary:
$21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Now, we find out how much he makes in a year from his new monthly salary:
$21,000 * 12 = $252,000.

Finally, we add the bonus to his annual salary:
$252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500.

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

- Distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
- Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance
- Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To figure out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to break it down into two parts: digging through the soil and digging through the clay.

1. **Digging through the soil:**
   - Bill can dig 4 feet per hour.
   - He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
   - Time to dig through the soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Digging through the clay:**
   - Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so he can dig 2 feet per hour.
   - He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
   - Time to dig through the clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total time to dig the well:**
   - Total time = Time to dig through the soil + Time to dig through the clay
   - Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To figure out how many cupcakes Howie needs to buy, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Count the total number of people:**
   - Howie
   - His teacher
   - 25 classmates

   So, the total number of people is:
   \[
   1 + 1 + 25 = 27
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cupcakes per person:**
   - Each person gets 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate).

3. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes:**
   - Multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes each person gets:
   \[
   27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes/person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes}
   \]

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Fishio got 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, we need to multiply 2000 by 70:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. Recently, she received 20000 more likes. So, we add these 20000 likes to the 140000 likes she already had:
   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is:

\[
\boxed{160000}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the total cost before the voucher is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Clara had a voucher that gave her $2 off, so the final amount she paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price of each pomegranate increased to $30. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at this new price, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

After applying the discount, the final amount Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
142"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Sales from Red Hats:**
   Ariadne made $400 from selling red hats in a month.

2. **Sales from Green Hats:**
   The sales from red hats were half of what she made from green hats. So, if $400 is half, then the total sales from green hats would be:
   \[
   400 \times 2 = 800
   \]

3. **Total Sales for the First Month:**
   To find the total sales for the first month, we add the sales from red hats and green hats:
   \[
   400 + 800 = 1200
   \]

4. **Sales for the Second Month:**
   In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales from the first month. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900
   \]

5. **Total Sales for Both Months:**
   Finally, to find the total sales for both months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:
   \[
   1200 + 900 = 2100
   \]

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ 2100 \]"
"James hired a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours in total. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that costs twice as much as the previous hour.

So, let's break it down:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $15 × 2 = $30
- Third hour: $30 × 2 = $60

Now, we add up the costs:
$15 + $30 + $60 = $105

So, James paid $105.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Sally started the week with $200 in her bank account.
2. By the end of the week, her bank account has $420.
3. The increase in her bank account is $420 - $200 = $220.
4. Sally's weekly wage should be $300.
5. To find out how much was withheld from her wage, we subtract the increase in her bank account from her expected wage: $300 - $220 = $80.

So, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage.

"To figure out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - So, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:
     \[
     16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs required:**
   - Each whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - To find out how many whole eggs are needed, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:
     \[
     \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves per egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - To find out how many dozens of eggs are needed, we divide the total number of whole eggs by 12:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
     \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"Shiela needs to write a 15-page research paper. She has already finished 1/3 of it. To find out how many pages she has left, we first figure out how many pages she has already written. 

1/3 of 15 pages is 5 pages. So, she has written 5 pages. 

To find out how many pages she has left, we subtract the pages she has written from the total number of pages:

15 - 5 = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Mike has to read a 200-page book in 30 days. He plans to read 10 pages each day. 

First, we need to find out how many days it will take him to read the whole book. We do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Days to finish} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Mike 20 days to finish the book. Since the assignment is due in 30 days, we need to find out how many days he will have left after he finishes reading:

\[ \text{Days before the deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: James bought the plane for $150,000.
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental**: He pays $5,000 each month to rent a hanger.
3. **Monthly Fuel Expenses**: He spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger rental, so that's $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for the hanger and fuel:
- Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
- Monthly fuel expenses: $10,000
- Total monthly cost: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we need to find out how much he spends on the hanger and fuel over the course of a year:
- Annual maintenance cost: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Finley took 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than it did to cook rice. So, the time to cook pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The time to cook beans is half the combined time of cooking pork and rice. First, we find the combined time:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the time to cook beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}

Now, we add up the times for all the food:
\[
30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}

"To figure out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of each part of the mixtures:

1. **Cost of 1/2 pound almonds:**
   - 1 pound of almonds costs $10.
   - So, 1/2 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts:**
   - 1 pound of walnuts costs $15.
   - So, 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.

Now, let's add these costs to find the total cost of the first mixture:
- Total cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, we do the same for the second mixture:

1. **Cost of 1/5 pound almonds:**
   - 1 pound of almonds costs $10.
   - So, 1/5 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts:**
   - 1 pound of walnuts costs $15.
   - So, 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.

Now, let's add these costs to find the total cost of the second mixture:
- Total cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Finally, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that Lee has only sheep and geese on his farm. We need to find out how many sheep there are.

1. **Total number of animal heads (animals):** 20
2. **Total number of animal legs:** 70

Let's use some simple algebra to figure this out.

- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals (heads) is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   - Sheep have 4 legs each.
   - Geese have 2 legs each.
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[
G = 20 - S
\]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
4S + 40 - 2S = 70
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2S + 40 = 70
\]

Subtract 40 from both sides:
\[
2S = 30
\]

Divide by 2:
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. Since Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more, we need to find out how much 20% of $5 is:

20% of $5 = 0.20 * $5 = $1

So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he's buying enough for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total cost for the coffee is:

7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42

He also bought a donut for $2. So, the total cost for everything is:

$42 + $2 = $44

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought:

- 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so that's 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- 1 bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- 1 bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, let's add up what he spent on these items:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Since Gus spent a total of $20.00, the remaining amount must be what he spent on the apple pie:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00.

198 + 209 = 407

Now, we subtract this total from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day:
600 - 407 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

First, we need to figure out how many hours John spends in the cooking class. The class meets 4 times a week, and each session is 2 hours long. So, each week, John spends:

4 times a week * 2 hours per session = 8 hours per week

The class runs for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours John spends in the class is:

8 hours per week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Now, John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by the number of hours it takes to learn one recipe:

48 hours / 1.5 hours per recipe = 32 recipes

So, John learns 32 recipes.

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers.

Next, we need to calculate the total time these 60 math teachers spend sleeping in one day. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so:

3. **Rayna's Money:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - So, Rayna has \(90 + 60 = 150\) dollars.

4. **Total Money:**
   - Add up all the money: \(120 + 90 + 150 = 360\) dollars.

5. **Sharing Equally:**
   - There are 3 people, so each person gets \(\frac{360}{3} = 120\) dollars.

Christina records her mood every day for 30 days. Here's what we know:
- She had 12 good days.
- She had 8 bad days.
- The rest were neutral days.

First, let's figure out how many neutral days there were:
- Total days: 30
- Good days: 12
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\)

Next, we know the distribution of her moods over the past 30 days:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The next 8 days were neutral.
- The last 6 days are what we need to figure out.

Now, the next three days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good

So, the last 6 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral)

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Last 6 days: 2 good days

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days

"To figure out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total growth needed to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow that much.

First, let's convert 20 feet to inches:
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Next, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches:
- Desired height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day, so we need to find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches:
- Number of days = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches.

First, we know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. To find out how many hash browns one potato makes, we divide 36 by 6:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, if one potato makes 6 hash browns, then 96 potatoes will make:

\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"To figure out how much the group will exceed the elevator's maximum load, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, let's find out the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults). Since each adult weighs an average of 80 kg:

\[ 9 \text{ people} \times 80 \text{ kg/person} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we need to see how this total weight compares to the elevator's maximum load of 700 kg:

\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Katarina's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 68 cookies.

2. **Max's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, Max must have:
   \[
   68 + 5 = 73 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookie Monster's Cookies:**
   Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if Max has 73 cookies, the Cookie Monster must have:
   \[
   73 - 12 = 61 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Summer's Cookies:**
   Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if Max has 73 cookies, Summer must have:
   \[
   73 + 23 = 96 \text{ cookies}
   \]

5. **Total Cookies:**
   Now, we add up all the cookies:
   \[
   68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298
   \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[
298

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Let's say the original length of the dress is \( L \) cm.
2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).
3. She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.
4. We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1.5L + 20 = 140
   \]
5. To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   1.5L = 120
   \]
6. Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[
   L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80
   \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - So, to mow half of the lawn in turtle mode, it would take him half of 60 minutes.
   - \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - So, to mow half of the lawn in rabbit mode, it would take him half of 40 minutes.
   - \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - To find the total time, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and half the lawn in rabbit mode.
   - \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school. They spend 6 minutes getting to the corner where the library is, and then they spend another 13 minutes getting to the fire station.

First, we add the time they spent getting to the library and the fire station:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have to get to school:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know two things:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of all the twins and triplets add up to 44.

Let's use \( T \) to represent the age of one twin and \( R \) to represent the age of one triplet.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ T = R + 7 \]

From the second piece of information, we know the total combined age:
\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Let's simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R = 6 \), we can find \( T \):
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Alright, let's break this down. John has 3 hours before dinner, which is 180 minutes. He needs to do 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 

First, let's add up the time for his homework:
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the homework time from the total time before dinner:
180 minutes (total time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. Let's figure out how many coins they save in total after ten years.

First, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves each month. If Rong saves 20 coins, then Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

Calculate the additional amount Neil saves:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins each of them saves in ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

5760"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each one costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill \( T \). The heartworm check costs 60% of \( T \), which can be written as:
\[ 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"To figure out the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them all up.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - Since one apple costs $0.50, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5
- Total cost for apples: $6
- Total cost for oranges: $21

The total price for the crate is \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To figure out how many square feet Brittany's quilted comforter is, we need to add up all the different colored squares. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - So, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - So, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - So, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up all the squares:
- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 18
- Green squares: 24
- White squares: 12

Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

   - Total people = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people.

2. **Chairs needed:**
   - Each adult needs a regular chair.
   - Each baby needs a high chair.
   - So, we need 42 regular chairs and 15 high chairs.

3. **Chairs available:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

4. **Total chairs available:**
   - Total chairs = 8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs.

5. **Chairs needed:**
   - We need 57 chairs in total.

   So, Betty has:
   \[
   50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has:
   \[

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of that 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out how much of the river's water is used for industrial purposes. We do this by multiplying 40% by 80%:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

So, 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes.

Next, we need to find out how much of the river's water is used for non-industrial purposes. We do this by subtracting the industrial water usage from the total water usage by the city:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

"To figure out how many quarts of ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours, we need to first find out how much they can make in one hour for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- So, in 1 hour, they make \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- So, in 1 hour, they make \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we need to find out how much they can make in 48 hours for each type:

For chocolate ice cream:
- In 48 hours, they can make \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- In 48 hours, they can make \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together:
- Total quarts = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus bought:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * 3 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * 2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * 4 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * 1 = $13.00

Next, we add up all these costs to get the total before the discount:

Total before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * 50 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final total:

Total after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

But with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Starting Amount of Candy:**
   Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy.

2. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day.
   - Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day.

3. **Total Days:**
   Two weeks is equal to 14 days.

4. **Total Candy Eaten:**
   - Ginger eats \( 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \).
   - Amy eats \( 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \).

5. **Candy Left:**
   - Ginger has \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \) left.
   - Amy has \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \) left.

6. **Difference in Candy:**
   - Amy has \( 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \) more than Ginger.

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"To figure out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first need to find out how much of the bathroom he wants to cover. He wants to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. 

First, we calculate two-thirds of 36 square feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, he would need:
\[ 24 \times 24 = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his bathroom.

"James decided to pick blueberries. It costs $20 to go picking, and then it's another $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. We need to figure out how much he saved compared to buying them at the store for $2.5 a pound.

First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
- The fixed cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost per pound is $1.5, and he picked 30 pounds.

So, the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \]

Adding the fixed cost:
\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \]

So, the total cost of picking the blueberries is $65.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5, and he would buy 30 pounds.

So, the cost for the blueberries at the store is:
\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \]

Now, to find out how much he saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying:
\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \]

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The company planned to buy 500 computers at $700 each.
2. The price of each computer increased by 10%.

First, we need to find out what 10% of $700 is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we need to find out how much the company paid for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid is:
\[ 385,000 \]"
"To figure out how many calories are in John's omelet, we need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg has 75 calories.
- So, the total calories from the eggs are \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese:
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.
- So, the total calories from the cheese are \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham:
- John uses 2 ounces of ham (the same amount as the cheese).
- Each ounce of ham has 40 calories.
- So, the total calories from the ham are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Finally, we add up all the calories:
- Total calories from eggs: 450
- Total calories from cheese: 240
- Total calories from ham: 80

So, the total calories in the omelet are \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 6 pencils cost. Each pencil costs $0.50, so:
6 pencils * $0.50/pencil = $3.00

Next, we need to find out how much 8 erasers cost. Each eraser costs $0.25, so:
8 erasers * $0.25/eraser = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers to get the total cost:
$3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

You paid $10.00, so to find out how much change you get, we subtract the total cost from the amount you paid:
$10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00

So, the change you would get is $5.00.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of people who apply:** 100 people.
2. **Percentage of people who receive interviews:** 30%.
   - To find out how many people receive interviews, we calculate 30% of 100:
   - \( 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \) people receive interviews.

3. **Percentage of people who receive a job offer:** 20%.
   - To find out how many people receive a job offer, we calculate 20% of the 30 people who received interviews:
   - \( 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \) people receive a job offer.

4. **Percentage of people who accept the position:** 1/3.
   - To find out how many people accept the position, we calculate one-third of the 6 people who received a job offer:
   - \( 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \) people accept the position.

So, the number of people who accept the position is:

"To figure out how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to do a couple of steps:

1. First, we add the number of sacks she gave to her cousin and her brother:
   - She gave 3 sacks to her cousin.
   - She gave 4 sacks to her brother.
   - So, 3 + 4 = 7 sacks in total.

2. Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of rice are in those 7 sacks. Each sack has 25 kilograms of rice.
   - So, 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

Therefore, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

"To figure out the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet, we need to break it down into two parts: when her arms are at her sides and when her arms are raised.

1. **When her arms are at her sides:**
   - She dances for 3 minutes (since she dances for 5 minutes total and 2 minutes with her arms raised).
   - Right foot: 300 taps per minute.
   - Left foot: 250 taps per minute.
   - Total taps for the right foot: \(300 \times 3 = 900\) taps.
   - Total taps for the left foot: \(250 \times 3 = 750\) taps.

2. **When her arms are raised:**
   - She dances for 2 minutes.
   - Both feet: 200 taps per minute.
   - Total taps for the right foot: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) taps.
   - Total taps for the left foot: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) taps.

3. **Total taps for both feet:**
   - Right foot: \(900 + 400 = 1300\) taps.
   - Left foot: \(750 + 400 = 1150\) taps.
   - Combined total: \(1300 + 1150 = 2450\) taps.

So, the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cost of damage to Ron's car if the pothole isn't fixed:**
   - The pothole will cause $450 worth of damage to Ron's car.

2. **Costs if Ron fixes the pothole himself:**
   - The city will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25.
   - Total cost for the asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75.

3. **Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole:**
   - Fine: $120
   - Asphalt: $75
   - Total: $120 + $75 = $195

4. **Money saved by fixing the pothole:**
   - Cost of damage if not fixed: $450
   - Cost to fix the pothole: $195
   - Money saved: $450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To figure out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to do a bit of subtraction. 

First, let's add up all the chairs the restaurant originally had:
- Normal chairs: 170
- Baby chairs: 23

So, the total number of chairs is:
170 + 23 = 193

Next, we need to subtract the chairs that were sent to the carpenter for repair:
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13

The total number of chairs sent for repair is:
20 + 13 = 33

Now, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
193 - 33 = 160

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total number of pizzas and slices:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each ordered a pizza.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - So, the total number of slices is \(5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
   - Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices} = 8 \text{ slices} \).
   - So, the total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends is \(3 \text{ people} \times 8 \text{ slices/person} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
   - Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \text{ slices} = 9 \text{ slices} \).
   - So, the total slices eaten by the remaining two friends is \(2 \text{ people} \times 9 \text{ slices/person} = 18 \text{ slices}\).

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is \(24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices}\).

5. **Slices left:**
   - The total number of slices left is \(60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}\).

So, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. 

Next, the dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. So, we need to find 2/3 of 30 minutes:
\[
\text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the cat's time and the dog's time, and then divide by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out the length of Bobby's shoe based on the information given about Topher's shoe.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Next, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many windows Hannah smashed in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows, so she smashes 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, we need to find out how many windows Hannah smashed in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4 of these windows, so she smashes 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashed is 112.

"To figure out what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of spools:**
   - Light blue: 15
   - Dark blue: 45
   - Light green: 40
   - Dark green: 50

   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. **Count the number of blue spools:**
   - Light blue: 15
   - Dark blue: 45

   Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. **Calculate the percentage of blue spools:**

At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line to vote. By midday, 2/5 of these people had already voted. To find out how many people that is, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 people had voted by midday. This means that 3000 people were still in line to vote after midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. To find out how many people that is, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 more people had voted by 16:00. This means that the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"To figure out how many boxes of graham crackers we need, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many smores everyone wants to eat:
- There are 9 kids, and each kid wants 2 smores. So, the kids will eat 9 * 2 = 18 smores.
- There are 6 adults, and each adult wants 1 smore. So, the adults will eat 6 * 1 = 6 smores.

Now, let's add the smores for the kids and the adults:
- Total smores needed = 18 (kids) + 6 (adults) = 24 smores.

Next, we need to figure out how many sleeves of graham crackers we need:
- Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
- To find out how many sleeves we need, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores each sleeve makes: 24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Finally, we need to determine how many boxes of graham crackers we need:
- Each box contains 3 sleeves.
- To find out how many boxes we need, we divide the total number of sleeves by the number of sleeves per box: 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

First, we know Dora is 15 years old. 

Next, we need to find out how old Dora's father is. The problem says that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Dora's father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 \]

\[ \text{Dora's father's age} = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old Dora's mother is. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Dora's mother's age} = 38 - 4 \]

\[ \text{Dora's mother's age} = 34 \]

So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Finally, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We add their ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 \]

\[ \text{Total combined age} = 87 \]

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5. The problem also tells us that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, to find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, we multiply the number of gallon jars by the cost per gallon jar:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, we multiply the number of half-gallon jars by the cost per half-gallon jar:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

First, we know there are 50 students in the class. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. The rest of the students like either video games or music.

The problem also tells us that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's add up the students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music:

\[ 10 \text{ (baking)} + 5 \text{ (basketball)} + 10 \text{ (music)} = 25 \]

So, 25 students are accounted for. The remaining students must like to play video games. To find out how many, we subtract the 25 students from the total number of students:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard.
2. He threw a stone and scared away 1/3 of the birds. To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 birds were scared away.
3. The number of birds left in the backyard after some were scared away is:
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8
   \]
4. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. So, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:
   \[
   8 + 20 = 28
   \]

Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students in both classes:**
   - The total number of students in both classes is 80.

2. **Number of students in each class:**
   - Since both classes have the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

3. **Number of girls in each class:**
   - 40% of the students in each class are girls.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

4. **Number of boys in each class:**
   - To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

So, the number of boys in each class is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up all the animals Melissa has to groom:
- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

So, the total number of animals is:
8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Now, Melissa needs to split these 28 animals evenly over 7 days. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:
28 ÷ 7 = 4 animals per day

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

"Mark bought 3 packs of old magic cards, and each pack cost him $1800. So, the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

From these packs, he got:
- One card worth $4000
- Another card worth $1000
- 30 more cards, each worth $50 on average

First, let's calculate the total value of the 30 cards:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Now, let's add up the value of all the cards he got:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find out how much profit Mark made, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, Mark's profit is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"To figure out how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the first park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the second park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two parks:
- The savings by choosing the second park is \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, Jake's family will save 28 dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Daily Cost with the Old Vendor:**
   - The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $0.50 each.
   - So, the daily cost was:
     \[
     500 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.50/\text{tomato} = \$250
     \]

2. **Daily Cost with the New Vendor:**
   - Now, the vendor buys 500 tomatoes a day at $0.40 each.
   - So, the new daily cost is:
     \[
     500 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.40/\text{tomato} = \$200
     \]

3. **Daily Savings:**
   - The savings per day is the difference between the old cost and the new cost:
     \[
     \$250 - \$200 = \$50
     \]

4. **Weekly Savings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:
     \[
     \$50 \times 7 = \$350

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, Carl has \(4 \times 56 = 224\) marbles.
3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, Cal has \(2 \times 56 = 112\) marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:

\[224 + 112 = 336\]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined.

"To figure out how many more groups are needed, we first need to understand how many students are in each group when there are 6 groups. We have 54 students in total, so we divide 54 by 6:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

This means there are 9 students in each group when there are 6 groups. Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups we need to form. Since we already have 6 groups, we subtract 6 from 12:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, we need 6 more groups to have a total of 12 groups.

"To figure out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many weekdays and weekends there are in two 4-week months:
- Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
- In one 4-week month, there are 4 weeks × 5 weekdays = 20 weekdays.
- In one 4-week month, there are 4 weeks × 2 weekend days = 8 weekend days.
- So, in two 4-week months, there are 2 × 20 weekdays = 40 weekdays.
- And in two 4-week months, there are 2 × 8 weekend days = 16 weekend days.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- On weekdays, Candy rents 60 chairs each day.
- So, the total number of chairs rented on weekdays is 60 chairs/day × 40 weekdays = 2400 chairs.
- On weekends, Candy rents 100 chairs each day.
- So, the total number of chairs rented on weekends is 100 chairs/day × 16 weekend days = 1600 chairs.

Finally, let's add the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends to get the total:
- Total chairs rented = 2400 chairs (weekdays) + 1600 chairs (weekends) = 4000 chairs.

So, the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months is:

   So, Gunther has:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas left}
   \]

3. The next day, Gunther adds 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Later that evening, Arnold steals 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. On the third day, Gunther adds 6 more bananas:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much the total electricity bill is for the whole year. Since the monthly bill is $100, we multiply that by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   100 \times 12 = 1200
   \]
   So, the total annual electricity bill is $1200.

2. Next, we need to divide this total cost by the number of people sharing the bill. Jenna has 4 roommates, so there are 5 people in total (Jenna + 4 roommates):
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]
   Each person, including Jenna, will pay $240 per year for electricity.

So, each roommate will pay **240** dollars per year for electricity."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many glasses and plates Jeff sent to the party.

- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen glasses is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.
- Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. So, 4 dozen plates is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses and plates were broken and subtract those from the total.

- 10 glasses were broken, so the number of glasses left is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.
- 6 plates were broken, so the number of plates left is 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates to get the total number of items Jeff has now.

- Total remaining items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items.

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. Here's what happens:

1. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 is \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 is \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

3. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - So, 20 large stickers are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

Now, let's add up all the buttons Lorraine has:

- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
- Large buttons: 20

Since each large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons:

- 20 large buttons are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

So, the total number of small buttons Lorraine has is:

\[ 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \]

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

We know that the council has 33 people, and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against. Let's call the number of votes in favor \( F \) and the number of votes against \( A \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. \( F = 2A \) (the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against)
2. \( F + A = 33 \) (the total number of votes is 33)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( A \):

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now that we know \( A = 11 \), we can find \( F \):

\[ F = 2A \]
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many shirts Krissa needs to order for her preschool students. We'll break it down step by step.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those 10 people. We subtract the 10 people from the total:

50 - 10 = 40 people

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

Finally, we need to find out how many people are left who think horse #12 will win. We subtract the 24 people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining 40 people:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We have three houses that need shingles. The total number of cases of shingles needed is 250. Here's what we know:
- The first house needs half as many cases as the second house.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house.

Let's use \( x \) to represent the number of cases the first house needs. Then:
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

Now, we can set up an equation to find \( x \):

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To figure out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to add up the time he spends driving and the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum and back. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 miles per hour.

The time to drive one way is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many wheels Henry needs for the cars. Each car needs 4 wheels, and he has 57 cars to assemble. So, we multiply:

57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

Next, we need to figure out how many wheels he needs for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, and he has 73 motorcycles to assemble. So, we multiply:

73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels needed:

228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:

"To figure out how much you have to pay for the laptop after a 20% discount, you first need to find out what 20% of $1000 is. 

20% of $1000 is calculated like this:
20% = 20/100 = 0.20
0.20 * $1000 = $200

So, the discount is $200. Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

You have to pay $800 for the laptop after the discount.

800"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: Mike has 600 movies.

2. **Movies in series**:
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - These series movies cost only $6 each (since they are a third of the normal price).
   - Total cost for series movies: \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars

3. **Remaining movies**:
   - Total remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \)
   - Cost of each older movie: $5
   - Total cost for older movies: \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars

4. **Newer movies**:
   - Number of newer movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)
   - Cost of each newer movie: $10
   - Total cost for newer movies: \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars

5. **Total cost**:
   - Total cost for series movies: $1200
   - Total cost for older movies: $800
   - Total cost for newer movies: $2400
   - Total cost to replace all movies: \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars

The final numerical answer is:
4400"
"To figure out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then add those costs together.

1. For peaches, he picked 6 pounds at $2.00 per pound:
   \[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]
   So, the peaches cost $12.00.

2. For plums, he picked 8 pounds at $1.00 per pound:
   \[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \]
   So, the plums cost $8.00.

3. For apricots, he picked 6 pounds at $3.00 per pound:
   \[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]
   So, the apricots cost $18.00.

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\[ 12 + 8 + 18 = 38 \]

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

"To figure out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot is, we need to break down the trip into two parts: the driving and the hiking.

1. **Driving:**
   - They drove for 4.5 hours (since the total trip was 6 hours and they hiked for 1.5 hours).
   - They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - To find the distance they drove, we use the formula: distance = speed × time.
   - So, the driving distance is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Hiking:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - So, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - To find the distance they hiked, we use the same formula: distance = speed × time.
   - So, the hiking distance is \(20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Total distance = \(225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}\).

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

"Okay, let's figure out the difference in scores between Ava and Emma in the video game.

1. **Emma's Score:**
   - Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, so she gets \( 10E \) points.
   - Emma collects \( B \) berries, so she gets \( 5B \) points.
   - Emma finishes the level with \( T \) seconds left on the timer, so she gets \( 30T \) points.
   - Total score for Emma: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \).

2. **Ava's Score:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies and gets \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \) points.
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects \( B + 3 \) berries and gets \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \) points.
   - Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer and gets \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \) points.
   - Total score for Ava: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \).

3. **Difference in Scores:**
   - Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
   - Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)
   - Difference: \( (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) = 25 \)

So, the difference between their two scores is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that the total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas together cost 30 dollars. So, to find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:

64 - 30 = 34 dollars

This means the remaining two pizzas together cost 34 dollars. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:

34 / 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"To figure out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break it down:

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - So, for the usual days: \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice as much as on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - So, for the special days: \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Add the rides from the usual days and the special days: \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob had 7 fish in total.
   - 3 of these were orange.
   - 4 of these were white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
   - Let's say he bought \( x \) white fish and \( y \) orange fish.
   - So, \( x + y = 17 \).

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After buying the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
   - The total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
   - This means \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \).

5. **Solve the Equations:**
   - First, simplify the condition equation:
     \[
     3 + y = 2(4 + x)
     \]
     \[
     3 + y = 8 + 2x
     \]
     \[
     y = 8 + 2x - 3
     \]
     \[
     y = 5 + 2x
     \]

   - Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the total fish equation:
     \[
     x + (5 + 2x) = 17
     \]
     \[
     x + 5 + 2x = 17
     \]
     \[
     3x + 5 = 17
     \]
     \[
     3x = 12
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
   - Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
   - Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
   - Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
   - Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

"To figure out how much Andy spends on gas each week, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, let's find out how many miles Andy drives in a week. He drives to work and back home each day, which is 5 miles each way. So, for one day, he drives:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total distance for the week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much gas he uses. His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so for 50 miles, he uses:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much this gas costs. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Andy spends $15 on gas each week.

2. **Twenties:**
   - Carrie has 10 twenties.
   - Each twenty is worth $20.
   - Total value of the twenties: \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

3. **Spending the Twenties:**
   - Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties.
   - Amount spent on the twenties: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

4. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Total amount spent on lunch: \( 35 + 120 = 155 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To figure out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to do a bit of multiplication and addition.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- So, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to get the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

142"
"Alright, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many smart TVs were sold. Since one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs, we can calculate this by:
   \[
   \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many analog TVs were sold. Since one-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs, we can calculate this by:
   \[
   \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
   \]

3. Now, to find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 10 - 5 = 25
   \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Find the night temperature:**
   - During the day, it's 45 degrees.
   - At night, it's 33 degrees colder.
   - So, the night temperature is 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees.

2. **Determine the temperature increase needed:**
   - The pipes will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees.
   - The current night temperature is 12 degrees.
   - To prevent freezing, we need to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.
   - The temperature increase needed is 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees.

3. **Calculate the number of logs needed:**
   - Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees.
   - To raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we need 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To figure out how many seashells were brought back, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into groups of 9, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups in total.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. The problem says that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

This means 6 groups had members bring back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought back by these groups is:

\[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so she worked 3 hours of overtime.
   - Overtime rate is 150% of her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = 150% * $20/hour = 1.5 * $20/hour = $30/hour
   - Overtime pay = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. **Total Pay:**
   - Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   - Total pay = $160 + $90 = $250

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work last Tuesday.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial number of employees**: The company starts with 200 employees.
2. **New hires each month**: The company hires 20 new employees every month.
3. **Number of months**: We need to calculate for 3 months.

First, let's find out how many new employees are hired in 3 months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we add these new employees to the initial number of employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month. So, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out the total amount paid over 3 months:

"To figure out how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, let's first add up all the stuffed animals she already has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's say Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals will then be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. So, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"James bought a ring for his bride-to-be. The diamond cost $600, and the gold cost $300. He also had to pay a 30% premium for it to be made. Let's figure out how much he paid in total.

First, we add the cost of the diamond and the gold:
- Diamond: $600
- Gold: $300
- Total cost of materials: $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:
- 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to get the final amount James paid:
- Final amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to add up the number of students who passed from each grade and divide that by the total number of students who took the test.

1. **Third Grade:**
   - Passed: 340
   - Total: 500

2. **Fourth Grade:**
   - Passed: 40
   - Total: 100

3. **Fifth Grade:**
   - The pass rate for the fifth grade is twice that of the fourth grade.
   - Fourth grade pass rate: 40/100 = 0.40 (or 40%)
   - Fifth grade pass rate: 2 * 0.40 = 0.80 (or 80%)
   - Number of fifth graders who passed: 0.80 * 400 = 320

4. **Total Passed:**
   - Third grade: 340
   - Fourth grade: 40
   - Fifth grade: 320
   - Total passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

5. **Total Students:**
   - Third grade: 500
   - Fourth grade: 100
   - Fifth grade: 400
   - Total students: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

6. **Overall Pass Rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = Total passed / Total students = 700 / 1000 = 0.70 (or 70%)

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To figure out how long Milo can make his mosaic, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Glass Chips**: Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag has 72 chips.
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Chips per Square Inch**: It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of the mosaic.
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. **Height of the Mosaic**: The mosaic is 3 inches tall. To find the length, we divide the total area by the height.
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much tea was drunk by the students. 

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea they drank is:
  \[
  4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts}
  \]

- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea they drank is:
  \[
  16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Next, we add the amounts of tea drunk by both groups of students:
\[
6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
\]

We know there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[
38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
\]

Now, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so:
\[
48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}
\]

So, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

"Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150, which means he sold all 100 he had and needed 50 more to fulfill the orders. Then, he ordered 100 more candies. After selling the 150, he has 50 candies left (100 ordered - 50 needed). So, Dale still needs to sell 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. The number of students doubles at the end of each month. We need to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May.

1. **End of January:** The number of students doubles from 10 to \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
2. **End of February:** The number of students doubles from 20 to \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
3. **End of March:** The number of students doubles from 40 to \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
4. **End of April:** The number of students doubles from 80 to \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
5. **End of May:** The number of students doubles from 160 to \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

So, by the end of May, there are 320 students on campus. To find out how many additional students have joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310.

"Felix charges kids to get their stuff out of trees, and he charges based on how high he has to climb. He charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. Over the week, he made $105. To find out how many branches he climbed on average each day, we need to do a few calculations.

First, let's figure out how many branches he climbed in total during the week. We do this by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:
\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:
\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches} \]

So, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

"Okay, let's figure out how many petals are left in the vase after Rose drops some flowers.

First, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower she picks:

- She picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
  \[
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
  \]

- Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
  \[
  4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
  \]

- Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
  \[
  5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
  \]

- Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
  \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she picked:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

But, she drops 1 of each type of flower. So, we need to subtract the petals of the dropped flowers:

- 1 flower with 5 petals:
  \[
  5 \text{ petals}
  \]

- 1 flower with 6 petals:
  \[
  6 \text{ petals}
  \]

- 1 flower with 4 petals:
  \[
  4 \text{ petals}
  \]

- 1 flower with 7 petals:
  \[
  7 \text{ petals}
  \]

Total petals dropped:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Now, subtract the dropped petals from the total petals:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The bag has 35 marshmallows.
2. John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
3. DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
4. They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, let's add up all the marshmallows that were used and lost:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

Now, subtract the total number of marshmallows used and lost from the original number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 marshmallows left. Since there are 2 kids (John and DeSean), we need to divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

Each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Jack and his three friends are playing at the arcade for 4 hours. We need to figure out how much money they spend in total.

First, let's figure out how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can only play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, let's add up all the quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money used is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. Tanya is making a salt scrub and she uses different ingredients in specific amounts. Here's what we know:

1. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest.
5. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.

Let's use a variable to represent the amount of citrus zest. Let's call it \( z \) ounces.

Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.

Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

Now, let's add up all the ingredients to make sure they total 10 ounces:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now that we know \( z = 1 \), we can find the amount of oil:
\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"John bought 3 goats and 2 cows. Each goat costs $500, and each cow costs $1500. To find out how much he spent, we need to multiply the number of each animal by its price and then add the totals together.

For the goats:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

For the cows:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, add the two amounts together:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, John spent $4500 in total.

"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we add the cupcakes he already has:

8 chocolate cupcakes + 40 toffee cupcakes = 48 cupcakes

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 cupcakes - 48 cupcakes = 15 cupcakes

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Determine how many cars Joe has initially:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - So, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate how many cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate how many cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - So, he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine how many cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - So, the number of cars Joe has left is \( 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \) cars.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To figure out how much each student raised, we first need to find out how much the students raised in total. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we have 20 students who each raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours to minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Hunter counted 50 cars when he first got to school.
2. During the first break, he saw 20 more cars join the parking lot. So, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70

3. When Hunter got out for lunch, he noticed that half of the cars had left. So, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
4. To find out how many cars were left in the parking lot during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars after the first break:

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored:

\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points} \]

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games:

\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

So, the total points Sasha scored during both games is:

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought:
- She bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package has 6 tins.
- So, the total number of tins of dog food is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) tins.

Now, we need to find out how many more tins of cat food she bought compared to dog food:
- The difference is \( 88 - 36 = 52 \) tins.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. So, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( P \). Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"Okay, let's figure out how many eggs Cindy had in total.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{9}{3} = 3

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month. Here's what he makes each week:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up what he makes in the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from the monthly total:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"To figure out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - So, the total time spent recording videos each week is \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes recording videos.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours each week writing songs.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) minutes writing songs.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week.
   - So, the total time spent doing makeup each week is \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \( 90 \times 4 = 360 \) minutes doing makeup.

Now, let's add up all the time spent on these activities in a month:

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost Angela to have everything installed.

The interior design firm charges $129.00 for the standard installation, which includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

First, let's see how many extra items she needs:
- She needs 6 mirrors, but the standard package includes 4, so she needs 2 more mirrors.
- She needs 2 chandeliers, but the standard package includes 1, so she needs 1 more chandelier.
- She needs 20 pictures, but the standard package includes 10, so she needs 10 more pictures.

So, the total number of extra items is:
2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 extra items

The cost for each extra item is $15.00, so the cost for 13 extra items is:
13 items × $15.00/item = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the extra items to the base installation fee:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

So, the total cost for Angela will be:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]
So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more Roy has saved, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[ 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]
So, Roy has saved an additional $12.00 on top of Anthony's $30.00.

Adding this to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:
\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - So, \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - So, \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - So, \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - So, \( 480 \) inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"Mason is riding his bike at a speed of 8 miles per hour. He rides for 4 hours, takes a break, and then rides for another 6 hours. To find out how many miles he has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance for each part of his trip and then add them together.

First, we calculate the distance for the first part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance for the second part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the trip to get the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

"To figure out how long it will take the turtles to cross the highway, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Find the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can think of it as the total work done by the kangaroos. The total work (distance) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles.
   - The speed of one kangaroo can be calculated by dividing the total distance by the time it takes for one kangaroo to cover that distance. Since 3 kangaroos together take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 3 times as long to cover the same distance alone. So, one kangaroo would take \( 18 \times 3 = 54 \) hours to cross the highway by itself.
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is \( \frac{1 \text{ highway}}{54 \text{ hours}} \).

2. **Find the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1 \text{ highway}}{54 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1 \text{ highway}}{108 \text{ hours}} \).

3. **Calculate the time for 4 turtles:**
   - If one turtle takes 108 hours to cross the highway, 4 turtles working together will cover the distance faster. The combined speed of 4 turtles is \( 4 \times \frac{1 \text{ highway}}{108 \text{ hours}} = \frac{4 \text{ highways}}{108 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1 \text{ highway}}{27 \text{ hours}} \).
   - Therefore, 4 turtles will take 27 hours to cross the highway.

So, the answer is 27 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora. So, Rory made:
   \[
   20 + 20 = 40 \text{ dishes}
   \]
3. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory. So, Jada made:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the dishes they made:
\[
20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[
140

"Erika is saving up for a new laptop that costs $600. She traded in her old laptop, which reduced the price by $200, so now the laptop costs $400. She has $150 from her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop. 

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]

Simplifying the right side:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 230 = 350 \]

Now, we solve for the money in her purse:

\[ \text{Money in purse} = 350 - 230 \]
\[ \text{Money in purse} = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and he has 3 large apples:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and he has 5 small apples:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract the slices he eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of apple slices left is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer has 3 cows, so the total milk produced is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
4. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production: \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters, the number of additional cows needed is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To figure out the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate how much of each glue stick is left and then add those amounts together.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. Since the original length is 12 mm:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. So:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. So:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we add the remaining lengths together:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up the total cost of the car and the phone:
- The car costs $10,000.
- The phone costs $800.
- So, the total cost is $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

Next, we need to add up the money Gabriel already has:
- Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends.
- His brother gave him $200.
- So, the total amount Gabriel has is $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Gabriel needs:
- The total cost is $10,800.
- Gabriel has $5,200.
- So, the amount he still needs is $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

Next, he buys six squirt guns, each costing $2. So the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he buys three packs of water balloons, each costing $3. So the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount he spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount he started with:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Craig has 19 dollars left.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so he has:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30

First, we know there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. Out of these, 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. We need to find out how many students are good at math, which includes those who are good at both math and English.

To find the number of students who are good at both subjects, we can subtract the number of students who are good at English only and those who are good at math only from the total number of students:

20 (total students) - 8 (good at English only) - 5 (good at math only) = 7 (good at both)

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To figure out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest. The formula is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here's what we know:
- The principal (P) is $300.
- The rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year.
- The time (T) is 3 years.

First, let's calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 300 \times 225 = 67500 \]
\[ 67500 \times 3 = 202500 \]

So, the interest earned over 3 years is $202,500.

Next, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 202500 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 202800 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many floral shirts have buttons and how many don't. The store has 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is 50 minus 20, which is 30.

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are compared to white shirts without collars. We already know there are 30 floral shirts without buttons and 20 white shirts without collars. 

So, the difference is 30 minus 20, which is 10.

First, let's figure out how many goats he sold from Farm Y:
- He sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- He sold twice as many from Farm Y, so that's \(10 \times 2 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate how many goats are left in each farm:
- Goats left in Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\)
- Goats left in Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\)

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."

   \[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

2. Next, we know he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

2. Next, calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food before the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - So, 3 baskets of red food cost: \( 3 \times 18 = 54 \) dollars.

3. Now, apply the discount to the red food:
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - So, the total discount for 3 baskets is: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.

4. Subtract the discount from the cost of the red food:
   - The cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount is: \( 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

5. Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food to get the total cost:

- My mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since her age is one less than three times my brother's age).

The total of all our ages is 87. So, we can write the equation:

First, let's simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Next, subtract 9 from both sides:

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has:
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To figure out how much Greg will spend on jello, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of jello cups needed:**
   - There are 30 kids, and each kid will have 4 jello cups.
   - So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
     \[
     30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups}
     \]

2. **Determine how many boxes of jello are needed:**
   - Each three-ounce box makes 10 jello cups.
   - To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of cups each box makes:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each box costs $1.25.
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:
     \[
     12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, Greg will spend:
\[
\boxed{15}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the 5 phones cost in total. Each phone costs $700, so we multiply:

5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

Next, we need to figure out how much change the seller should give back. The seller gave $4000, so we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change.

500"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total Monthly Cost**: Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 on groceries each month.

2. **Madeline's Share**: Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   - 60% of $400 is calculated as:
     \[
     0.60 \times 400 = 240
     \]
   - So, Madeline pays $240.

3. **Keenan's Share**: The remaining amount is what Keenan pays.
   - Total cost minus Madeline's share:
     \[
     400 - 240 = 160
     \]
   - So, Keenan pays $160.

4. **Weekly Cost for Keenan**: Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost.
   - Weekly cost for Keenan:
     \[
     \frac{160}{4} = 40
     \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

"Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. Let's figure out how many pieces he ate over the three days.

1. **First Day:**
   - Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   - \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \) pieces.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Tobias ate 10 pieces.
   - Total eaten by the end of the second day: \( 24 + 10 = 34 \) pieces.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Remaining pieces after the second day: \( 60 - 34 = 26 \) pieces.
   - Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.
   - \( \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \) pieces.

4. **Total Pieces Eaten:**
   - Total eaten by the end of the third day: \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) pieces.

"To figure out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs:
- 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- So, 1 bottle of soda costs $21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00.

Next, we need to find out how much one bottle of water costs:
- 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
- So, 1 bottle of water costs $8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda:
- 3 bottles of soda * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

And the cost for 2 bottles of water:
- 2 bottles of water * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total:
- $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

"To figure out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to do a couple of steps. First, we calculate the total cost of the bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. So, we multiply the cost per bolt by the number of bolts:

\[ 0.03 \times 16 = 0.48 \]

This means the total cost of the bolts is $0.48. Now, we subtract this amount from the $12.48 that David has:

\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. So, we need to find out how many glasses the boys sold together and then how many each of them sold.

1. Total glasses sold by the boys:
   32 (total) - 14 (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses

2. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
   18 / 2 = 9 glasses each

3. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
   14 (Julie's sales) - 9 (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount Sarah will get from selling the rope is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Sarah plans to use this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. The cost of the new rope will be:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope:

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, Sarah will have \$10 left over.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Melanie's age to be three times her current age, let's start by finding out how old she is right now.

If in 10 years Melanie will be 18, we can find her current age by subtracting 10 from 18:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]
So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
where \( x \) is the number of years from now.

First, calculate three times her current age:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Bacon Cost:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   - So, each pack of bacon costs: \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Chicken Cost:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - So, each packet of chicken costs: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is: \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Strawberries Cost:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

4. **Apples Cost:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - So, each pack of apples costs: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for bacon: $10
- Total cost for chicken: $24
- Total cost for strawberries: $12
- Total cost for apples: $14

The total cost for all items is:
\[ 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Kelly has 5 dollars left in her budget."

- On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, so that's \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Total chimichangas = 125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday)
- Total chimichangas = 500

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the singer has 50 microphones. The problem says that 20% of these microphones won't fit in pairs. So, we need to find out how many microphones that 20% represents.

To find 20% of 50, we do:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to figure out how many pairs of microphones can be made from 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total Earnings:**
   Tasha made a total of $80 last month.

2. **Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's.
   - The second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's.

3. **Number of Times Mowing Each Lawn:**
   - Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( J \) times.
   - Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - And she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

4. **Total Number of Times Mowing Lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

5. **Total Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid $6 for all the times Tasha mowed lawns, and \( J \) is the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

6. **Earnings from Lemonade Sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

Now, Susan wants to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew gets, we divide 96 by 6:

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each nephew will get 16 cookies.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Pages read yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel didn't read any pages today, so he read 0 pages.

3. **Total pages read:**
   - Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages
   - Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages

4. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The pot has enough soup to fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl. That means they will use 2 adult bowls.
3. Since 1 adult bowl is the same as 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are the same as 4 child bowls.
4. The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup. After Calvin and his wife eat, there will be:
   - 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls left.
5. Calvin has two children, and each child will have one bowl at a meal. So, the 4 child bowls left can be divided among the two children:
   - 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 times.

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To figure out how much William spent, we need to do a bit of simple math. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.
- So, the total cost for the notebooks is \( 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- The ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.
- So, the total cost for the ballpen is \( 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \).

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
- Total cost = Cost of notebooks + Cost of ballpen
- Total cost = \( 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \)

So, William spent a total of $8.00.

8.00"
"To figure out how much material Jo needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much material is needed for one small mask and one large mask.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).

Now, we calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

For 20 small masks:
- Material needed = 20 masks * 0.5 yards per mask = 10 yards.

For 8 large masks:
- Material needed = 8 masks * 0.75 yards per mask = 6 yards.

Finally, we add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To figure out the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to do a bit of math. First, let's find out how many times she went to the movies. She saw 9 movies, and each one 3 times. So, we multiply 9 by 3:

9 movies * 3 times each = 27 times

Now, we know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the number of times she went to the movies:

$216 / 27 times = $8 per ticket

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up all the time he spends on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

First, let's figure out how many red shoe boxes he uses:
- He has 9 red shoe boxes.
- 1/3 of 9 is 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's subtract the shoe boxes he uses from the total he originally had:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

So, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
- 4 blue shoe boxes + 6 red shoe boxes = 10 shoe boxes

The final answer is:

Dean has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. To find out how many marbles that is, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

Now, let's add up the total number of marbles Dean has given away:

\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the original number of marbles:

\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \]

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We also know that Duncan is 60 years old now.

First, let's figure out Duncan's age eight years ago:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

So, Duncan was 52 years old eight years ago.

Next, we need to set up the equation based on the information given. Let \( A \) be Adam's current age. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we need to calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 acres:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the sizes together:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \]

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour:**
   - Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
   - So, \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) packages per hour.

2. **Determine his hourly earnings:**
   - Colby earns $0.20 for each package.
   - So, \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \) dollars per hour.

3. **Calculate his total earnings for an eight-hour workday:**

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. In total, he threw 58 pieces of bologna. We know that there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces/balloon} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we know that the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. So, the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total pieces thrown at yellow balloons by 3:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many tune-ups he needs. The car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"Julia and Nadine decided to combine their allowances to buy a birthday surprise for their dad. They bought a cake for $11, 1 dozen balloons for $0.5 for every 2 balloons, and 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. We need to figure out how much allowance each of them got from their mom.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons:
- 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons.
- Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons would cost \( \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \) dollars.

Next, let's add up all the costs:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice cream: 2 tubs at $7 each, so \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) dollars.

Total cost:
- \( 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) dollars.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To figure out how much money the class raised from selling lollipops, we need to do a few calculations. Here’s how we can break it down:

1. **Total Lollipops Sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - So, the total number of lollipops sold is \(30 \times 10 = 300\) lollipops.

2. **Total Revenue:**
   - Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling the lollipops is \(300 \times 0.8 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
   - So, the total cost of buying the lollipops is \(300 \times 0.5 = 150\) dollars.

4. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - So, the profit is \(240 - 150 = 90\) dollars.

The class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Okay, let's figure out how many pets Larry has step by step.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish is:
   \[

"To figure out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to add up how many slices Abby and Josh eat together each day and then see how many days it takes to finish the loaf.

Abby eats 2 slices a day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so he eats 4 slices a day. Together, they eat:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ slices a day} \]

The loaf has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat each day:

"Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old, and she collects one shell every month. By the time she turns 10, she will have been collecting shells for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of shells she will have collected by multiplying the number of years by the number of months in a year:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since she collects one shell each month, she will have collected:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

"Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows. In each row, she makes the same number of chamomile and mint tea cups. She also uses some cups to make 15 cups of cinnamon tea. We need to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's figure out how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea after making the cinnamon tea:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

So, there are 12 cups left for chamomile and mint tea. These 12 cups are divided equally into 3 rows:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

This means each row has 4 cups of chamomile and mint tea combined. Since each row has an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups, we divide these 4 cups by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To figure out the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many calories are in one mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
- So, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, let's find out how many calories are in one mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
- So, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Then, let's calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins:
- Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed from Monday to Friday and then divide by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:
- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 times Monday's count = 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 times Monday's count = 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add these numbers together:
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

First, add 39 and 78:
39 + 78 = 117

Next, add 117 and 78:

"To figure out how much farther the bus went compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each one traveled and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- So, the distance the bus traveled is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- So, the distance the car traveled is \(30 \times 8 = 240\) miles.

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
- The difference is \(300 - 240 = 60\) miles.

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To figure out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already had and then see how many more toys she has now.

First, let's add up the toys:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

So, the total number of toys before the bouncy balls is:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:
62 - 48 = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we would in a high school math class.

We know the following:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's use variables to represent their ages:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( L \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be Jean's age.

From the problem, we can write these equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, we can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( P = 2J + 10 \)

We can substitute \( P \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + L + J = 100 \]

Since \( L = J + 10 \), we can substitute \( L \) as well:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
\[ L = J + 10 \]
\[ L = 20 + 10 \]
\[ L = 30 \]

Finally, we can find Peter's age:
\[ P = L + J \]
\[ P = 30 + 20 \]
\[ P = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}

   - So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
   - Adding Maria's balloon, the total at the start is \(1 + 8 = 9\).

2. **Balloons from Mom:**
   - Maria's mom gives each person (Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons.
   - There are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
   - So, the total number of additional balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

3. **Total Balloons:**
   - Adding the initial balloons to the additional balloons: \(9 + 15 = 24\).

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
24"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many boxes of stuff we have in total. We know that 10 people each donated 5 boxes, so:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

We also have 10 boxes of stuff already, so:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many tables we need to fit all 60 boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes, so:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

We already have 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables we need:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

So, the number of new tables needed is:
15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Zoey's Total Distance:**
   - Zoey has 40 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 10 feet.
   - So, the total distance Zoey spits is \( 40 \times 10 = 400 \) feet.

2. **Sydney's Total Distance:**
   - Sydney has 35 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 12 feet.
   - So, the total distance Sydney spits is \( 35 \times 12 = 420 \) feet.

3. **Combined Total Distance:**
   - The combined total distance is \( 400 + 420 = 820 \) feet.

4. **Average Total Distance:**
   - To find the average, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants, which is 2.
   - So, the average total distance is \( \frac{820}{2} = 410 \) feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

1. **Calculate the number of widgets each machine makes in a day:**
   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - It makes 60 widgets per hour.
     - It runs 24 hours a day.
     - So, in one day, it makes \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) widgets.

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - It makes 45 widgets per hour.
     - It runs 24 hours a day.
     - So, in one day, it makes \( 45 \times 24 = 1080 \) widgets.

2. **Calculate the number of widgets each machine makes in a month:**
   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - It makes 1440 widgets per day.
     - The month has 30 days.
     - So, in one month, it makes \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) widgets.

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - It makes 1080 widgets per day.
     - The month has 30 days.
     - So, in one month, it makes \( 1080 \times 30 = 32400 \) widgets.

3. **Calculate the total revenue for each machine:**
   - Each widget sells for $6.
   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Total revenue: \( 43200 \times 6 = 259200 \) dollars.

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Total revenue: \( 32400 \times 6 = 194400 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the difference in revenue:**
   - Difference: \( 259200 - 194400 = 64800 \) dollars.

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning. That's a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For every hour after that, it's an extra 70 pesos.

First, let's figure out how many extra hours Cameron will stay:
17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours

Now, let's calculate the cost for those extra hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, it would have cost him 1600 pesos. To find out how much he saves, we subtract the cost of his actual stay from the 24-hour stay cost:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos.

"To figure out how much hay Nate needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much hay each type of animal needs:

1. **Goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - Nate has 15 goats.
   - So, the total hay for the goats is \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs is \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - So, each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Nate has 12 sheep.
   - So, the total hay for the sheep is \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

Now, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total amount of hay:

- Total hay needed = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
- Total hay needed = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay. 

159"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much money John made this week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John spends 50 dollars on gas. So, we subtract that from his total earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank. So, we subtract that from the remaining amount:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John buys 5 pencils, and each pencil costs 10 dollars. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

We subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, John wants to buy 25 dollar pens. To find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

So, John can buy 4 pens.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Craig and his brother are playing a game where they spell out the longest words they know and count the letters. After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words, and each word has 15 letters. 

First, let's find out how many letters Craig has spelled in total:
\[ 20 \text{ words} \times 15 \text{ letters per word} = 300 \text{ letters} \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, we need to add 50 to the number of letters Craig has spelled:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 50 \text{ letters} = 350 \text{ letters} \]

Now, to find the total number of letters both Craig and his brother have spelled, we add the letters Craig has spelled to the letters his brother has spelled:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 350 \text{ letters} = 650 \text{ letters} \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

"To figure out how many kids are in the drill, we need to multiply the number of kids in each row by the number of rows, and then by the number of schools. 

- There are 8 kids in each row.
- There are 7 rows for each school.
- There are 5 schools.

So, we do the math like this:

\[ 8 \text{ kids/row} \times 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ kids} \]

Therefore, the total number of kids in the drill is 280.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total Bottles of Apple Juice:**
   - The teacher has 9 coupons.
   - Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.
   - So, the total number of bottles is \( 9 \times 100 = 900 \) bottles.

2. **Bottles Given to Students:**
   - There are 29 students.
   - Each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice.
   - So, the total number of bottles given to students is \( 29 \times 2 = 58 \) bottles.

3. **Bottles Left for the Teacher:**
   - Subtract the number of bottles given to students from the total number of bottles.
   - Bottles left for the teacher = \( 900 - 58 = 842 \) bottles.

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

"To figure out how much Patty charged, we need to add up all the costs. 

1. **Visit Charge**: Patty charges $40 just for coming to the house.
2. **Labor Charge**: She charges $35 for each hour of work. The job took 2.25 hours, so we need to multiply 2.25 by 35.
3. **Parts Charge**: The parts used cost $60.

First, let's calculate the labor charge:
\[ 2.25 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 78.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the charges:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars (visit)} + 78.75 \text{ dollars (labor)} + 60 \text{ dollars (parts)} = 178.75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Patty charged:

"James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost without any discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

He gets a 40% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount:

\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the discount is $60. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much he actually paid:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James then sells 5 of the CDs for $40. This means he gets $40 back. To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the amount he paid:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

50"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops. 

First, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of crop:

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam sells for $1.50.
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.50/yam = $9.00.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato sells for $2.00.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2.00/sweet potato = $20.00.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot sells for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.00.

Now, we add up the earnings from all the crops:

- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00.

So, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time James spends swimming the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To figure out how much commission Cayley earns, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- So, the commission per copy is \(5 \times 0.10 = 0.50\) dollars.
- Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times is \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- So, the commission per copy is \(15 \times 0.08 = 1.20\) dollars.
- Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \(10 \times 1.20 = 12.00\) dollars.

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = \(3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00\) dollars.

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. Let's use this information to find out how many points Azibo scored.

1. Let's say Azibo scored \( A \) points.
2. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
3. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total points:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To figure out how many pages are in the book, we need to use the information given: the book is 1.5 inches thick, and there are 100 pages per inch. Since each sheet of paper has a page on each side, we don't need to do anything special for that part.

First, we calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch:

\[ 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many minutes Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. That's 15 hours.

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, to find the total number of reports he stapled, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total Sleep Time:**
   - Kim usually goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time Spent Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - 5 minutes.

4. **Total Time Subtracted from Sleep:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total Sleep Time on the Bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted: 28 minutes.
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils left:
\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The hospital has 1000 beds in total.
2. At the start, 1/5 of the beds are occupied. So, we need to find out how many beds that is:
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. But Kelly thinks Courtney made a mistake and said there were 20% more people than there actually were. 

To find out how many people really attended, we need to figure out what 100% (the actual number) would be if 48 is 120% (100% + 20%).

Let's set up the equation:
\[ 48 = 1.2 \times \text{actual number} \]

To find the actual number, we divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ \text{actual number} = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

First, we need to figure out how many holes the pirates dug each day and the total by the end of each day.

- **First day:** They dug 10 holes.
- **Second day:** They dug 13 holes.
- **Third day:** They dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's add up the total number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes} \]

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes was four times the number of holes dug on the first day. Since they dug 10 holes on the first day, four times that is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes} \]

So, by the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes in total. To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes} \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon. We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's use variables to represent the number of Pokemon each person has caught:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- Let \( X \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \) (total Pokemon caught)
2. \( X = S + 5 \) (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \) (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe)

First, we can substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
Simplify this:
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, we substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
Simplify this:
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
Substitute \( A = 40 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each episode of the show is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the entire show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[ 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"To figure out the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to add up all the distances the bird flew in the south direction and then subtract the distance it flew north.

1. **First part of the trip:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second part of the trip:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third part of the trip:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we add the distances flown south and subtract the distance flown north:
- Total distance south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\).
- Distance north: \(36 \text{ miles}\).

Net distance south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"Greta made a batch of brownies for her birthday. She made 1 dozen, which is 12 brownies. At her office, they gave her half a dozen more, which is 6 brownies. Her friends surprised her with 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies she had at the start is:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

During the party, 1.5 dozen brownies were eaten. That's 18 brownies:
\[ 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \]

To find out how many brownies Greta had left, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate the time it takes to string each type of racquet:

1. **Synthetic Gut:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time for synthetic gut: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. **Polyester String:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester string: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Set:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid set: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we add up all the times to get the total time:

\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227\] minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"John is buying new phones for himself, his wife, and his two kids. The price of each phone is $600. The first two phones are full price, but any additional phones are half price.

Let's break it down:
- The first phone costs $600.
- The second phone also costs $600.
- The third phone is half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.
- The fourth phone is also half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600
- Third phone: $300
- Fourth phone: $300

Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we need to add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team to find out how many players are on Zeke's team.

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Now, to find the total number of players on both teams, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

"To figure out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to find the total length of the fence he's building. Since the fence is a rectangle, we can find the perimeter by adding up all the sides. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

So, the perimeter \( P \) is:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats he needs is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. That means she gave away a total of 4 boxes. So, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

Then, she kept 1/4 of the 8 boxes for herself. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate 1/4 of 8:
1/4 * 8 = 2 boxes.

So, she kept 2 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 * 20 = 120 oranges.

1. The USA has 50 states.
2. India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
3. Half of 50 is 25.
4. So, India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in both countries:
- USA: 50 states
- India: 29 states

Total number of states in both countries: 50 + 29 = 79.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much all the books cost together. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. So, we add these up:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39.

Next, we need to see how much more money Tyler needs. He has already saved $14. We subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he has to work to earn $25. We divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

3. The total number of cherries is 60. We know Robert has 30 and Richard has 20, so the number of cherries Jerry has is:
   \[
   60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries}
   \]
4. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20
   \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To figure out how much Sunny earned over the two days, let's break it down step by step.

### Saturday:
- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

### Sunday:
- Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

### Total Sales:
- Total gingerbread sold: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie sold: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

### Earnings:
- Gingerbread costs $6 per box, so earnings from gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6/box = $150
- Apple pie costs $15 per box, so earnings from apple pie: 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

### Total Earnings:
- Total earnings = Earnings from gingerbread + Earnings from apple pie
- Total earnings = $150 + $315 = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Daily Sunscreen Usage:**
   - Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours each day.
   - So, she uses \(1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}\).

2. **Total Sunscreen Usage Over 8 Days:**
   - She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.
   - She is on vacation for 8 days.
   - So, she will use \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

3. **Number of Bottles Needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - She needs 32 ounces in total.
   - So, she will need \(\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means it costs 60% of the blue car's price. If the blue car costs $100, then the red car costs 60% of $100.

To find 60% of $100:
\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160.

1. **Emil's Current Age:**
   - Emil is 19 years old now.

2. **Emil's Age in 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

3. **Emil's Dad's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - So, Emil's dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

4. **Emil's Dad's Current Age:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

5. **Emil's Brother's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - So, Emil's brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

6. **Emil's Brother's Current Age:**
   - Since Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

7. **Sum of the Ages of Emil's Dad and Brother Now:**
   - Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.
   - Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Thursday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

2. **Friday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday.
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}

"Alright, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students in Mr. Roper's class are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this by:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players leave:

30 students - 6 students = 24 students

Now, out of these 24 remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this by:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Finally, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To figure out how much money Pat will spend at the store, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - So, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will take up 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - To find out how many plants can fit, divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \)
   - Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \( 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."

"Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 each, and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each. We need to find out how much she will spend in total.

First, let's figure out the cost for one basket:
- Cost of 3 petunias: 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
- Cost of 2 sweet potato vines: 2 * $2.50 = $5.00

Now, add these costs together to get the total cost for one basket:
- Total cost for one basket: $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
- Total cost for 5 baskets: 5 * $14.00 = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Jessica saves each month for fancy shoes. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.

25% of $2,000.00 is:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Jessica saves $6,000.00 in a year for shoes.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she saves by the cost of one pair of shoes:

"To figure out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's look at peeling:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute.
- To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's look at cooking:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 to find the number of batches:
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
  \]
- Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
  \[
  3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we add the time for peeling and cooking:
- Peeling time: 15 minutes
- Cooking time: 30 minutes
- Total time: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 3 hours, it cools the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 4 hours, it cools the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 2 hours, it warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's add up the total cooling and warming:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Dad's Age When He Saw the Comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.

2. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet a Second Time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw it.
   - So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Time Interval Between Comet Sightings:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - So, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Buford writes a lot of checks every year. Let's break it down:

- He writes 1 check each month for the electric bill. That's 1 check × 12 months = 12 checks.
- He also writes 1 check each month for the gas bill. That's another 1 check × 12 months = 12 checks.
- He writes 2 checks each month for the church. That's 2 checks × 12 months = 24 checks.
- He writes 1 check every quarter for the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so that's 1 check × 4 quarters = 4 checks.

Now, let's add them all up:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks.

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights go to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So, the remaining flights are \( F - \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{1}{4}F \).
4. Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F \).

Now, we know that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can find the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

3. **Igneous' Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined.
   - So, Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - To find the total time, we add up the durations of all three howls.
   - Total time = \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

5. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - So, \(120\) seconds is \(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount given by his mother and father is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The trousers cost $30.
5. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers: \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

So, Adam had to contribute 12 dollars from his savings.

"Okay, let's figure out Wilfred's age step by step.

We know the total age of the four children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.

Let's add up the ages of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred must be:
\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \]

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. First, let's find the average age of the group:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we know Helene is 10 years old. We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
\[ \text{Wilfred's age} = 13 - 10 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

\[
\boxed{3}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cookies were brought to the wedding. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. So, we need to find half of 1500:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. We have a family of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon needs to be divided such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

1. Let's say each kid's slice is \( x \) (some amount of the watermelon).
2. Since each adult's slice is twice as big, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

Now, let's figure out the total amount of the watermelon:

- The 4 kids together get \( 4x \).
- The 2 adults together get \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).

So, the total amount of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Amount each adult gets}}{\text{Total amount of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

25%"

"To figure out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes for each step and then count backward from 5:00 pm.

1. **Making the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Baking the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Cooling the cake:** 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
4. **Frosting the cake:** 10 minutes

First, let's add up all the minutes:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, convert 180 minutes to hours:
180 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

So, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To figure out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Find the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   - So, the number of female porcupines is \(50 \times \frac{3}{5} = 30\).

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is \(30 \times 4 = 120\).

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the total number of babies born in a year is \(120 \times 12 = 1440\).

4. **Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population:**
   - The initial population is 50.

"To figure out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular shape, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given:
   - Length = 25 feet
   - Width = 14 feet
   - Depth = 4 feet

   So,
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company says to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we know there are 9 red sticks.
2. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. So, we add 5 to 9:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
   So, there are 14 blue sticks.
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we subtract 3 from 14:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]
   So, there are 11 yellow sticks.

Now, we add up all the sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of sticks is 34."

1. **Total Students**: The school has 3000 students.

2. **Students Over 16**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - So, the number of students over 16 is \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \).

3. **Male Students Over 16**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.
   - So, the number of male students over 16 is \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \).

4. **Female Students Over 16**:
   - The rest of the students over 16 are female.
   - So, the number of female students over 16 is \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \).

"To figure out how much water is left to fill the tank, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank. The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of what she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

Maria's power bank loses charge at different rates over time. We need to figure out how much charge it had when she left for the park.

1. **Last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - We need to find the charge before these 3 hours.

   Let's call the charge before the last 3 hours \( x \).

   Each hour, the power bank retains 93% of its charge (100% - 7% = 93%).

   So, after 3 hours, the charge is:
   \[
   x \times 0.93 \times 0.93 \times 0.93 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x \times 0.93^3 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]

   So, the charge before the last 3 hours was about 34.8%.

2. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour.
   - We need to find the charge before these 5 hours.

   Let's call the charge before the first 5 hours \( y \).

   Each hour, the power bank retains 91% of its charge (100% - 9% = 91%).

   So, after 5 hours, the charge is:
   \[
   y \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y \times 0.91^5 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]

   So, the charge before the first 5 hours was about 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

58.9%"
"To figure out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the down payment:**
   - The car costs $10,000.
   - Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   - Down payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * 10,000 = $2,000.

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   - Janet makes $10 an hour from her wages.
   - She also makes $15 an hour from tips.
   - Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25.

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   - Total earnings per week = $25 * 40 = $1,000.

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   - Down payment needed = $2,000.
   - Total earnings per week = $1,000.
   - Number of weeks = $2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks.

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Alright, let's figure out how many plums Jamaar can buy with the money he has left.

First, let's add up the cost of the fruits Jamaar has already bought:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost:

$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the amount of money he has left is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can find out how many plums Jamaar can buy by dividing the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Anne has a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces in the box is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Each pack has 60 pieces, so the number of pieces she kept is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

This means the number of pieces she gave away is:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with a 5% increase each year, we can use a simple formula. The formula for calculating the future value with compound interest is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate \( 1 + r \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put them into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
   \[
   \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]

2. Out of these 8 albums, 3 albums are selfies only. So, the total number of selfies is:
   \[
   \text{Total number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27
   \]

3. Additionally, 2 albums are portraits. So, the total number of portraits is:
   \[
   \text{Total number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

4. To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and the number of portraits:
   \[
   \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45
   \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is 45.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   \[

4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, we add 30 to 61:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91

1. **Total number of questions:**
   - The quiz has 60 questions in total.

2. **Number of easy questions:**
   - 40% of the questions are easy.
   - So, the number of easy questions is 40% of 60.
   - \( 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \) easy questions.

3. **Number of average and difficult questions:**
   - The remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions.
   - Total remaining questions = 60 - 24 = 36.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, so each large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Next, we know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold \(x\) large stuffed animals. Then, she sold \(2x\) small stuffed animals.

The total amount of money she made from selling the small stuffed animals is \(4 \times 2x = 8x\) dollars. The total amount of money she made from selling the large stuffed animals is \(12 \times x = 12x\) dollars.

The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \(x\) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To figure out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to add up the sandwiches each person eats every day and then multiply by 7 because there are 7 days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches a day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches a day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches a day.

First, let's add up the sandwiches they eat in one day:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, we multiply the daily total by 7 to get the weekly total:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

77"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

First, we need to figure out how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes.

- She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so she made \(80 \times 1 = 80\) dollars from cookies.
- She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so she made \(60 \times 4 = 240\) dollars from cupcakes.

Now, let's add these amounts to find her total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \] dollars

Next, we need to subtract the money she gave to her sisters. She gave $10 to each of her two sisters, so:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \] dollars

Finally, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \] dollars

So, Suzanne has 300 dollars left from her earnings.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs in total. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. So, the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that 10 eggs were not found by anyone. So, the number of eggs that were found by someone is:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by their friends is:
\[ 90 - 60 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the friends found 30 eggs.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Ore Mined by One Dwarf with Bare Hands:**
   - A single dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.

2. **Ore Mined by One Dwarf with an Iron Pickaxe:**
   - With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much as with his bare hands.
   - So, \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.

3. **Ore Mined by One Dwarf with a Steel Pickaxe:**
   - With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.
   - So, \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

4. **Ore Mined by 40 Dwarves with Steel Pickaxes in One Day:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe, then 40 dwarves can mine:
   - \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

5. **Ore Mined by 40 Dwarves with Steel Pickaxes in 30 Days:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then in 30 days they can mine:
   - \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To figure out how much the package with 8 sandwiches costs, we need to look at the prices of the other packages and see if there's a pattern.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3. So, each sandwich in this package costs:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. So, each sandwich in this package costs:
\[ \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

Since the prices are proportional, each sandwich in the third package should also cost $1.5. The third package has 8 sandwiches, so the total cost would be:
\[ 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000.
2. He sells his old bedroom set for $1000.
3. He uses the $1000 to pay part of the new bedroom set, so he still owes:
   \[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]
4. He has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. So, 10% of $2000 is:
   \[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Red Balloons:**
   - Sally started with 25 red balloons.
   - 40% of the red balloons burst.
   - 40% of 25 is \( 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \).
   - So, 10 red balloons burst.
   - Remaining red balloons: \( 25 - 10 = 15 \).

2. **Yellow Balloons:**
   - Sally started with 12 yellow balloons.
   - She released half of them.
   - Half of 12 is \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \).
   - So, 6 yellow balloons were released.
   - Remaining yellow balloons: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \).

3. **Blue Balloons:**
   - Sally found 8 blue balloons.
   - She added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.
   - 75% of 8 is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \).
   - So, she added 6 blue balloons.

4. **Total Balloons:**
   - Red balloons: 15
   - Green balloons: 7 (no change)
   - Yellow balloons: 6
   - Blue balloons: 6

Now, let's add them all up:

"To figure out the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to look at all the different things that could happen and how likely they are.

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. If this happens, Marcus doesn't have to turn it in.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher:**
   - If the normal teacher is there (50% chance), there are two more things to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give everyone an extension. If this happens, Marcus doesn't have to turn it in.
       - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
     - **Personal extension:**
       - If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension to the whole class (60% chance), there's still a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension.
       - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, let's add up all the probabilities where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Extension for the whole class: 20%
- Personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To figure out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to do a bit of math. First, we need to find out how many seats are left for friends and family after the seats for graduates and faculty are taken.

The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people. Out of these, 950 seats are for the graduates and 300 seats are for the faculty. So, we subtract the seats for graduates and faculty from the total number of seats:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

This means there are 4750 seats available for friends and family. Now, we need to divide these seats equally among the 950 graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate can give 5 tickets to their friends and family.

"To figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.

2. **Medium-Sized Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - So, he can eat \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \) medium-sized beans.

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3.
   - So, he can eat \( 150 \times 3 = 450 \) small beans.

Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total Hours Spent:**
   Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Total Earnings:**
   Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days.
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Expenses:**
   Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.

"To figure out how long it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - So, the number of bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \).

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th bottle.
   - This means he will move between 7 pairs of bottles.

3. **Total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \( 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds} \).

4. **Total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - Since he starts at the first bottle and doesn't need extra time to drop the candy in the first bottle, the total time is just the time to move between the bottles.

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total Cost of College:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans each year.
   - So, the total loans he gets are: \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

2. **Income Lost While in School:**
   - Before college, Jim had a job paying $25,000 a year.
   - He didn't work for 4 years while in college.
   - So, the total income he lost is: \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount to Earn Back:**
   - The total amount Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income is: \( 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \) dollars.

4. **New Income After College:**
   - After college, Jim's income is tripled.
   - His new income is: \( 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \) dollars per year.

5. **Time to Earn Back the Total Amount:**
   - To find out how long it will take Jim to earn back the total amount, we divide the total amount by his new annual income.
   - Time needed: \( \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \) years.

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the size of each piece of fabric. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Jim wants the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters.
   - One-fifth of 425 is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice 102 is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Add the letters delivered on each day: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \).

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - So, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race.
   - So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

So, Johnny's dad lost an average of $7.17 that day.

"To figure out the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to first convert all the heights to the same unit. Let's use inches for this.

1. Xavier was 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert Xavier's height:
   - 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
   - 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

2. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
   - 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

3. Now, we find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's new heights:
   - 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

We have three people dividing $1920. Let's call the amount the first person gets \( x \).

The second person gets $80 more than the first person, so the second person gets \( x + 80 \).

The third person gets twice what the second person gets, so the third person gets \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, let's simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person's share is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To figure out how many hours each painter worked, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days Worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - So, the total number of days worked is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Fraction of a Day Worked Each Day:**
   - They worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.

3. **Convert Fraction of a Day to Hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day is \( \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \) hours.

4. **Total Hours Worked by the Team:**
   - They worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - So, the total hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times 9 = 189 \) hours.

5. **Hours Worked by Each Painter:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - So, the hours worked by each painter is \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Each painter worked 47.25 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls over three sets. We need to find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set.

Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is \( x \).

1. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. So, we can write the equation:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, let's combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To get rid of the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]

This gives us:

\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we need to find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate how much it depreciates each year and then apply that depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010.

The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car is worth 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Price in 2007:**
   \[
   \text{Initial Price} = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Price in 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2008} = 20,000 \times 0.79 = 15,800

4. **Price in 2010:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2010} = 12,482 \times 0.79 = 9,860.78

"Okay, so if Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, we need to figure out how far she has driven in total and then see how much more she needs to drive to reach New York City.

First, let's calculate the total distance she has already driven:
\[ 325 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 1300 \, \text{km} \]

Now, the total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:
\[ 1955 \, \text{km} - 1300 \, \text{km} = 655 \, \text{km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days. She drinks 8 cups every day, so:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon, so:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people get on the train:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (100 people) get on the train:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off the train:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Alison spent on her athletic gear.

1. **Tank top**: She bought a tank top for $10.
2. **Running shorts**: The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top. So, the shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis shoes**: The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. So, the shoes cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic socks**: The socks cost $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off. So, the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on her athletic gear.

"To figure out how much it will cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. **Find out how many tiles we need:**
   - Each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, so each tile covers 1 square foot.
   - The kitchen floor is 200 square feet.
   - So, we need 200 tiles to cover the entire floor.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile.
   - Total cost = 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

So, it will cost $2400 to renovate the kitchen floor.

2400"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The normal cost of insurance is $120 a month.
2. After the accident, the cost increased by 60%. To find out how much the cost increased, we need to calculate 60% of $120.
   \[
   120 \times 0.60 = 72
   \]
3. So, the new monthly cost is the normal cost plus the increase:
   \[
   120 + 72 = 192
   \]
4. To find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   192 \times 12 = 2304
   \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. His laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

First, let's figure out how many loads he does each week:

1. For the twin beds:
   - He has 4 twin beds.
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time.
   - So, he needs to do:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets}
     \]

2. For the king size bed:
   - He has 1 king size bed.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time.
   - So, he needs to do:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load for king sheets}
     \]

Now, let's add up the total number of loads he does each week:
\[
2 \text{ loads for twin sheets} + 1 \text{ load for king sheets} = 3 \text{ loads per week}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many loads he does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[
3 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks per year} = 156 \text{ loads per year}
\]

So, the final answer is:
\[
156

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Movies on Saturday:**
   - Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday compared to Saturday.
   - Half of 4 movies is 2 movies.

3. **Total movies per weekend:**
   - On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
   - So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

4. **Total movies in 4 weeks:**
   - They watch 6 movies each weekend.
   - Over 4 weeks, they watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

So, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24.

"To figure out how many stickers Leo has now, we need to add up the stickers he had and the ones he collected over the past few years.

- Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
- Last year, he added 50 more stickers to his collection.
- This year, he collected twice as many stickers as he did last year, which means he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, let's add them all up:

\[ 100 \text{ (two years ago)} + 50 \text{ (last year)} + 100 \text{ (this year)} = 250 \]

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them twice a day.
2. Each feeding, each cat gets 60 grams of food.
3. So, for one feeding, all 3 cats together eat:
   \[ 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams} \]
4. Since they are fed twice a day, the total amount of food they eat in one day is:
   \[ 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]
5. Imma has 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount they eat per day:
   \[ 720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total Slices of Pizza:**
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - There are 4 pizzas.
   - So, the total number of slices is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

2. **Slices Eaten by Each Person:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Becky: 10 slices
   - Jake: 7 slices
   - Silvia: 14 slices
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Betsy and Donovan made a meal together, and the whole meal took 98 minutes. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. We need to find out how long Betsy's part took.

Let's call the time Donovan took to make his part \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time would be \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for both parts is 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Now, let's solve for \( D \):
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"Okay, let's break down the costs for Hannah's doctor's visit step by step:

1. **Cost of the cast**: The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
2. **Cost of the visit**: The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The doctor charges $300 per hour.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the visit} = 0.5 \times 300 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: Hannah gets 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the painkillers} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The mandatory minimum parking time is 2 hours, and the cost is $6 per hour.
   \[
   \text{Cost of parking} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

James gets 80 emails a day. Out of these, 20% don't need a response. So, we need to find out how many emails do need a response.

First, let's figure out what 20% of 80 is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, 16 emails don't need a response. That means the rest of the emails do need a response. To find out how many emails need a response, we subtract the 16 emails from the total 80 emails:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"To figure out how many classes visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that came each day.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many as Monday, so that's \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many as Monday, so that's \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we calculate:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the number of pizzas they ate from the total number of pizzas they ordered:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
So, the glee club has 6 pizzas left.

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club. Since the glee club ordered 20 pizzas, the football team ordered:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we calculate:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the number of pizzas they ate from the total number of pizzas they ordered:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
So, the football team has 8 pizzas left.

Finally, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the pizzas left by the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pizzas left is:

"To figure out how much Anthony spends on mailing the coupons, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Number of Big Coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he's sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons}
   \]

2. **Cost of Mailing Small Coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Cost of Mailing Big Coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. So, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   Add the costs of the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
   \[
   3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert to Dollars:**
   Since 100 cents equal 1 dollar, the total cost in dollars is:
   \[
   24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage.

"Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion: buy one pound of butter, get the next pound at half price. The butter costs $4.00 a pound.

Let's break it down:
- For the first pound, he pays $4.00.
- For the second pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the third pound, he pays $4.00.
- For the fourth pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the fifth pound, he pays $4.00.
- For the sixth pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

So, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter.

But 4 people said they couldn't come, so the number of people attending is:
45 - 4 = 41

The theater charges $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest, they charge $6. Since 41 people are coming, we need to find out how many additional guests there are:
41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional 21 guests is:

"To figure out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total bananas for the week:**
   - Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.

2. **Daily consumption of the first monkey:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - Over a week, the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.

3. **Daily consumption of the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - So, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - Over a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.

4. **Total consumption of the first and second monkeys for the week:**
   - The first and second monkeys together eat \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas in a week.

5. **Total consumption of the third monkey for the week:**
   - The total number of bananas is 315.
   - The third monkey eats the remaining bananas: \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas in a week.

"Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five 5 dollar bills and they only have quarters for change, how many quarters does she leave with?

First, let's figure out the cost of 15 roses. A dozen roses (12 roses) cost $15, and each additional rose costs $2.

- Cost of 12 roses: $15
- Cost of 3 additional roses: 3 * $2 = $6
- Total cost of 15 roses: $15 + $6 = $21

Jenny has five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
- Total money: 5 * $5 = $25

Now, let's find out how much change she gets:
- Change: $25 - $21 = $4

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $4 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:
- Number of quarters: $4 / $0.25 = 16

So, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

Next, let's calculate the total sales for the burger platters:
- Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
- So, the total for burger platters is \( 9 \times 11 = 99.00 \).

Finally, let's calculate the total sales for the sodas:
- Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.
- So, the total for sodas is \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30.00 \).

Now, we add up all the totals:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how long Paul will wait for his train.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - So, it leaves 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - So, it leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 145 minutes.

"To figure out the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price, we need to follow a few steps:

1. First, find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we calculate:
   \[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]
   So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

2. Next, we need to find out how much Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for. He sold it at 120% of the price he paid:
   \[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]
   So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for $1800.

3. Now, we need to determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price. The original price was $2000, and his friend paid $1800, so the discount is:
   \[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

4. Finally, to find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

"To figure out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Find the total number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - So, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14,400 seconds

2. **Determine how many jellyfish one spring creates in 14,400 seconds:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish every second, in 14,400 seconds, it would create 14,400 jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish, then 5 springs would create 5 * 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

So, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000.

"James decided to walk to the store. When he got halfway there, he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back. If his home is 4 miles from the store and he walks 4 miles per hour, how long did it take him to reach the store?

First, let's break down the problem:

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the total time it took him, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"To figure out how much Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying the bananas individually to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny got in total:
- Jenny bought 10 bunches.
- Each bunch has an average of 4 bananas.
- So, the total number of bananas is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- So, the total cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- So, the total cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much Jenny saved:
- The savings is the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches.
- So, the savings is \(32 - 30 = 2\) dollars.

Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence in total.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

Let's use \( S \) to represent the amount of fence Sam gets. Then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of fence.

The total amount of fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To figure out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find out how much it grows each year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth per year is:
\[ \text{Growth per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth per year by 13:
\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes**: Half of the total bikes
   - \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes
3. **BMX bikes**: 15% of the total bikes
   - \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes
4. **MTB bikes**: The rest of the bikes
   - Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes

Next, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Price of each type of bike**:
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars
   - Trekking: $450

2. **Earnings from each type of bike**:
   - Earnings from MTB: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars
   - Earnings from BMX: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars
   - Earnings from Trekking: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the bikes to get the total earnings.

- Total earnings: \( 52,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = 131,250 \) dollars

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

131250"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours. The farmer makes 5 bales each hour. So, in 6 hours, the farmer makes:
   \[
   5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours. The truck picks up 3 bales each hour. So, in 6 hours, the truck picks up:
   \[
   3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}
   \]

3. Finally, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
   \[
   30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales}
   \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field at the end of the 6-hour day is 12.

12"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many periods John has in a week. He has 6 periods a day, plus 2 extra classes, so that's 8 periods a day. Since he goes to school 5 days a week, we multiply:

\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time he spends in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, John spends an additional 1/16 of his weekly class time on both Saturday and Sunday. First, we calculate 1/16 of 1600 minutes:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra learning time to the regular class time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Initial Height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third floor, and each floor is 24 feet high.
   - So, the initial height is \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) feet.

2. **First Bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height.
   - After the first bounce, the height is \( 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \) feet.

3. **Second Bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height after the first bounce.
   - After the second bounce, the height is \( 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \) feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the height of the fourth child is:
\[
72 \text{ inches}

"To figure out how much the orchard made, we need to do a couple of steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag has 10 apples, and the orchard sold 2000 apples, we divide 2000 by 10:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much money was made from selling these bags. Since each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the orchard earned $1000.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is half of the total weight of the triceratops.
2. The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, so they ate half of the remaining half.
3. After the velociraptors, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.

Let's call the total weight of the triceratops \( x \) kilograms.

1. After the T-Rex ate, the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. After the velociraptors ate, the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To figure out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to first find out the total area of the walls that need to be painted. 

1. The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
   \[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
   Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
   \[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

2. The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
   \[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
   Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
   \[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

3. Now, we add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
   \[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

4. A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
   \[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

5. Each gallon of paint costs $12. So, the total cost to paint the room is:
   \[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost to paint the room is $144.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen has a case of 12 sodas.
   - 3 of these sodas are shaken.
   - 9 of these sodas are unshaken.

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - Now, there are 11 sodas left.
   - 3 of these are still shaken.
   - 8 of these are unshaken.

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Now, there are 8 sodas left.
   - 2 of these are shaken.
   - 6 of these are unshaken.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - We need to find the probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda.
   - There are 2 shaken sodas out of 8 total sodas.
   - The probability is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \text{Probability as a percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%
     \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how fast each train is going:
- The first train is going 60 miles per hour.
- The second train is going half that speed, so it's going 30 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how far each train travels in 3 hours:
- The first train: 60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles
- The second train: 30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Since the trains are going in opposite directions, we add the distances together to find out how far apart they are:
- Total distance apart: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, after 3 hours, the trains are 270 miles apart.

270"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many days there are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is:

31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

Next, Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days that is, we calculate:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

So, Billy takes 10 days off. This means he works on the remaining days:

50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Now, Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day. So, the number of people he helps each day is:

2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Finally, to find out how many people he helps in total, we multiply the number of people he helps each day by the number of days he works:

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

So, the total number of people Billy helps is:

240"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people the buses can carry. There are 12 buses, and each bus can carry 35 people. So, we multiply the number of buses by the number of people each bus can carry:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people the cars can carry. There are 20 cars, and each car can carry 3 people. So, we multiply the number of cars by the number of people each car can carry:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people the buses can carry to the number of people the cars can carry to get the total number of people:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people who were inside the church is 480.

480"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

So, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To figure out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each one.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- People slide down at a speed of 60 feet per minute.
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- People slide down at a speed of 80 feet per minute.
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes.

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
- Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

2"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Lunch Time:**
   - Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch break each day.

2. **Break Time:**
   - Bobby takes 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long.
   - So, the total break time per day is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.

3. **Total Time per Day:**
   - Total time for lunch and breaks per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.
   - 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

4. **Total Time for 5 Days:**
   - If Bobby works 5 days, the total time for lunch and breaks is 5 * 1 hour = 5 hours.

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we know that Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles}
   \]
3. Now, we add the miles run by Amber and Micah:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]
4. The total distance run by all three is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from 52:
   \[
   52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. Now, we add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish in the tank are large. So if the total number of jellyfish is \( T \), then the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

Next, we're told that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We're also given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we can solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Figure out how much Lauren needs each year for retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary.
   - Her current salary is $100,000.
   - So, 40% of $100,000 is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \).

2. **Calculate the total amount Lauren needs for 20 years of retirement:**
   - She needs $40,000 each year.
   - For 20 years, that's \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \).

3. **Determine how much Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her salary.
   - Her salary is $100,000.
   - So, 20% of $100,000 is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \).

4. **Find out how many years it will take to save $800,000:**
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - To save $800,000, she needs \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two steps:

1. First, we need to divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts.
2. Then, we need to divide each of those parts into 5 equal parts.

Let's start with the first step:
- If we divide 100 centimeters by 4, we get:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
  \]
  So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

Next, we divide each 25 centimeter part into 5 equal parts:
- If we divide 25 centimeters by 5, we get:
  \[
  \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
  \]
  So, each of the final parts is 5 centimeters long.

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 cm.

"To figure out how many girls are in the school, we first need to find out the total number of students. We know that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. 

Let's set up the equation to find the total number of students, which we'll call \( T \):

\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To solve for \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. Since the total number of students is 600 and there are 240 boys, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to add up the heights of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, let's add up the heights:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches

Now, let's add these together to get the total height:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches

Next, we divide the total height by the number of women to find the average:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. She plans to hike 125 miles twice a day. Let's figure out how many more miles she needs to hike each day to reach her goal.

First, let's calculate how many miles she will hike each day with her current plan:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, let's find out how many miles she will hike in the entire month:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike to reach 9,300 miles:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles each day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.

"To figure out how much the store will make after selling all the balls, we need to multiply the number of each type of ball by its price and then add up all the totals.

First, let's calculate the total for the red balls:
- There are 3 red balls, and each one costs $9.
- So, the total for the red balls is \(3 \times 9 = 27\) dollars.

Next, for the blue balls:
- There are 11 blue balls, and each one costs $5.
- So, the total for the blue balls is \(11 \times 5 = 55\) dollars.

Finally, for the green balls:
- There are 25 green balls, and each one costs $3.
- So, the total for the green balls is \(25 \times 3 = 75\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the totals:
- Total revenue = \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\) dollars.

So, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much of the 12 kg of apples Pierre and Paul want.

Pierre wants a quarter of the apples:
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants a third of the apples:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, let's add up how much Pierre and Paul are taking:
\[
\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the total amount of apples to find out how much Jacques will have left:
\[
\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

So, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Raymond has left step by step.

1. Raymond started with $21.
2. He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has:
   \[
   21 + 11 = 32
   \]
3. He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has:
   \[
   32 - 5 = 27

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Anna had a budget of $16. She has already spent $4, and now she has $2 left. First, we need to find out how much she has spent in total. 

Total spent = Initial budget - Money left
Total spent = $16 - $2 = $14

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the books today. She had already spent $4, so:

Money spent on books today = Total spent - Money already spent
Money spent on books today = $14 - $4 = $10

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total spent on books by 2:

Cost of each book = Money spent on books today / 2
Cost of each book = $10 / 2 = $5

So, each book cost $5.

"To figure out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times, we first need to find out how many times it blinks in one minute. 

The lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. So, to find the number of blinks per minute, we divide 255 by 5:

\[ \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for 459 blinks. We do this by dividing 459 by the number of blinks per minute:

\[ \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's count the initial number of male and female fish in Tate's pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfish: 3
- Female goldfish: 5

Next, Tate buys more fish:

- Additional male guppies: 2
- Additional female guppies: 1
- Additional male goldfish: 2
- Additional female goldfish: 3

Now, let's add these to the initial counts:

- Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Total male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
- Total female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fish:

- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

Finally, we need to find out how many more female fish there are than male fish:

- Difference: 16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - So, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - So, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to do their chores:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To figure out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - One-way distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - A round trip means driving to his parents' house and back.
   - Round trip distance = One-way distance × 2
   - Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for the month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total monthly distance = Round trip distance × 2
   - Total monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

"To figure out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total toys made by the first four workers:**
   - Two workers make 6 toys each hour. So, in 10 hours, they make \(2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
   - The other two workers make 4 toys each hour. So, in 10 hours, they make \(2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
   - Together, the four workers make \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys in 10 hours.

2. **Determine the total number of toys needed and how many are still needed:**
   - The order is for 400 toys.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to complete the order.
   - This means they have made \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys by the end of the shift.

3. **Calculate the number of toys made by the fifth worker:**
   - The four workers made 200 toys.
   - The total made by all five workers is 380 toys.
   - So, the fifth worker must have made \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

4. **Find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour:**
   - The fifth worker made 180 toys in 10 hours.
   - So, the fifth worker makes \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Seth had \( S \) stickers initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob.
6. So, Kris had a total of \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
7. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16

   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

3. **Let's Set Up Equations:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - So, \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).

4. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - \( 2S + 12 = 30 \)
   - \( 2S = 18 \)

5. **Eggs Painted by Camden:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

6. **Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - So, \( 2A \) is the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline.

7. **Total Eggs Painted by All:**

"To figure out the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Find out how many groups of 8 crayons there are:**
   - Nik has 200 crayons.
   - Each group has 8 crayons.
   - Number of groups = 200 crayons ÷ 8 crayons/group = 25 groups.

2. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   - Total weight of crayons = 200 crayons × 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   - Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   - Total weight of boxes = 25 boxes × 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes:**
   - Total weight = 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**

First, John cuts down an 80-foot tree. But he can only use 80% of it for logs. So, we need to find out how much of the tree he can actually use:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, he cuts the usable part of the tree into 4-foot logs. To find out how many 4-foot logs he can get, we divide the usable length by 4:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each 4-foot log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we need to find out how many planks he gets in total:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, he sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

"To figure out how long it takes Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break it down into the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk.

1. **Time on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach.
   - It takes her 40 minutes to walk these 2 miles.
   - So, her speed on the beach is \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Time on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.
   - Her speed on the sidewalk is \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).
   - So, it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

3. **Total time for the walk:**
   - Time on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes
   - Total time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Jane has been saving $4 every week for the past 8 weeks. So, the total amount she has saved so far is:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Jane wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find out how many marbles Bob has now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36:

"To figure out the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we need to use a bit of math. Donny mixes 4 ounces of water from the first mug, which is 33 degrees, with 1 ounce of water from the second mug, which is at an unknown temperature. After mixing, the water is warm enough for him to drink, which means it's at least 40 degrees.

Let's call the temperature of the water in the second mug \( T_2 \).

The formula to find the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures is:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Now, solve for \( T_2 \):
\[ T_2 \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

So, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

First, we need to find out how much 4 packs of bagels cost without any discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is buying 4 packs, so:
\[ 4 \times 10.00 = 40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. To find 10% of $40.00, we calculate:
\[ 0.10 \times 40.00 = 4.00 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted price:
\[ 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00 \]

Russell is buying 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels. So, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total discounted cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36.00}{36} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per bagel is:

First, we need to figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's break that down:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times x \]
\[ 54 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day, so:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we need to figure out how many eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases it to 5 eggs a day, so:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs he eats in 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. We know there are 17 green jellybeans.
2. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans, so:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ red jellybeans}
   \]
3. The total number of jellybeans is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:
   \[
   60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9
   \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Tim has 5 trees.
2. Each tree gives him 6 lemons every year.
3. We need to find out how many lemons he gets in 10 years (a decade).

First, let's find out how many lemons he gets from one tree in one year:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} \]

Next, let's find out how many lemons he gets from all 5 trees in one year:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Now, let's find out how many lemons he gets in 10 years:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of passengers is 84.

First, we need to find out how many parts the total number of passengers is divided into. The ratio 5:9 means there are 5 + 9 = 14 parts in total.

Next, we find out how many people each part represents:
\[
\text{Number of people per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
\[
\text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30
\]
\[
\text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54
\]

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[
\text{Number of women remaining} = 54 - 20 = 34
\]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:
34"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many individual sunflowers Faraday sells each day. He earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers, and each sunflower costs $2. So, we divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

\[ \text{Number of individual sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sells each day. He earns $56 from selling bouquets, and each bouquet costs $8. So, we divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. So, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold each day is:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers in bouquets per day} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \]

Now, we add the number of individual sunflowers sold to the number of sunflowers in the bouquets to get the total number of sunflowers sold each day:

\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold over 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291.

1. **Calculate how many rocks Adam can buy:**
   Adam has $100, and each rock costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]

2. **Determine how many rocks he sells:**
   Adam sells 60% of his inventory.
   \[
   \text{Rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks:**
   Each rock is sold for $7.
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of buying the rocks:**
   Adam bought 20 rocks at $5 each.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 5 = 100
   \]

5. **Determine the loss:**
   The loss is the total cost minus the revenue.
   \[
   \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16

"To figure out how many days Lauren needs to finish all the picture scenes, we need to break it down by the size of the scenes and then add up the days.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large scenes each day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large scenes.
   - So, the number of days for large scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium scenes each day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium scenes.
   - So, the number of days for medium scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small scenes each day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small scenes.
   - So, the number of days for small scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we add up all the days:
- Total days = 9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days.

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"To find the average speed, we need to figure out the total distance Sid traveled and the total time it took him. 

First, let's add up the distances:
- Sid traveled 110 miles and then 140 miles.
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, let's add up the time:
- Sid traveled for 2 hours and then 3 hours.
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.

"To figure out the chance that both lottery tickets win, we need to look at the probability of each ticket winning and then multiply those probabilities together.

1. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. That's the same as 0.20 in decimal form.
2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, we multiply 20% by 3 to get 60%, which is 0.60 in decimal form.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets win, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To convert this back to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 \div 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells: \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\) seashells

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[
\frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells}

"To figure out how many fruits an avocado tree can produce over 10 years, let's break it down year by year:

- At 5 years old, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- At 6 years old, it produces 3 times the amount from when it was 5 years old, so that's 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- At 7 years old, it produces 7 times the amount from when it was 5 years old, so that's 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- At 8 years old, it produces 200 fruits less than it will at 10 years old.
- At 9 years old, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- At 10 years old, it produces 20 times the amount from when it was 5 years old, so that's 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, to find out how many fruits the tree produces at 8 years old, we need to know how many it produces at 10 years old, which is 1000 fruits. So, at 8 years old, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Let's add up all the fruits produced from 5 to 10 years old:
- 5 years: 50 fruits
- 6 years: 150 fruits
- 7 years: 350 fruits
- 8 years: 800 fruits
- 9 years: 0 fruits
- 10 years: 1000 fruits

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, let's define the lengths of the ropes:
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it is \( 4B \).
- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \).

We know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( B \):
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. Now, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To figure out the total area of the house, we need to add up the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom:
- Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet.
- So, the area of one bedroom is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
- \(4 \times 240 = 960\) square feet.

Next, the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom:
- The area of the living room is \(5 \times 240 = 1200\) square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add up all these areas to get the total area of the house:
- Total area = Area of the bedrooms + Area of the living room + Area of the rest of the house
- Total area = \(960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160\) square feet.

So, the total area of the house is:

   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills. So, the number of $20 bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill. So, he uses:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   This leaves him with:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   The value of the remaining 20 $20 bills is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Thomas triples this amount:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he gets:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial Chalk Length:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday:**
   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - 45% of 5 inches is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - So, the remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Chalk Usage Each Day After Monday:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - This means 80% of the chalk remains each day.

4. **Calculate the Remaining Chalk for Each Day:**
   - **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
     - Remaining chalk: \( 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
     - Remaining chalk: \( 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

5. **Determine When the Chalk is Less Than 2 Inches:**
   - After 1 day (Tuesday), the remaining chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days (Wednesday), the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

So, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many girls and boys are on the varsity team.

- There are 12 girls in total, and one-third of them are on varsity. So, we calculate:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
  \]

- There are 12 boys in total, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. So, we calculate:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
  \]

Next, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many students are not on varsity. We know there are 24 students in total (12 girls + 12 boys). So, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[
24 \text{ total students} - 7 \text{ students on varsity} = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to calculate three times the number of face masks Mike bought and then add 2 more.

First, we calculate three times the number of face masks Mike bought:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we add 2 more to this number:
\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth in total.
2. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, if he drills 4 teeth, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.
4. The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.
5. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula: (Number of teeth fixed / Total number of teeth) * 100.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:
50%"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total Milk Purchased:**
   - Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk.

2. **Cost per Gallon:**
   - The cost of each gallon of milk is $3.5.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
     \[
     4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Expired Milk:**
   - 2/5 of the milk was expired. To find out how much milk was expired, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Refund Amount:**
   - The refund is for the expired milk. To find the refund amount, we multiply the number of expired gallons by the cost per gallon:
     \[
     1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we would in a high school math class.

We need to find out how old Colin is right now. We have two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's use \( W \) for Wendy's current age and \( C \) for Colin's current age.

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, we'll expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]

Now, distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll move all terms involving \( C \) to one side and the constant terms to the other side:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To figure out how many books Bob can buy for each school, we need to do a couple of steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy in total with $27,000.
2. Then, we divide that total number of books by 3, because he's splitting the books equally among 3 schools.

Let's start with the first step. We know that 100 books cost $500. So, to find out how much one book costs, we divide $500 by 100:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000, we divide $27,000 by the cost of one book:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Finally, to find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books for each school.

"Okay, let's figure out how many apples Newton brought home step by step.

1. Two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, which made 5 more apples fall out.
3. Now, there are 6 apples on the ground (1 from the first event + 5 from the second event).
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put 5 in his pocket, and threw the last one at the tree, which made 6 more apples fall out.
5. Now, there are 7 apples on the ground (1 from the previous step + 6 from the third event).
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event.
- 5 apples from the second event.
- 6 apples from the third event.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 1 + 5 + 6 = 12.

"To figure out how much Ali's order costs, we need to do a couple of steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags of coal Ali ordered. We do this by dividing the total weight of the coal by the weight of each bag:
   \[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

2. Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:
   \[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Ali's order costs 306 dollars.

"To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slices of each type of pizza her friends will eat in total.

1. **Cheese Pizza:**
   - Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
   - Total cheese pizza slices eaten: \( 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices/friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Pepperoni Pizza:**
   - Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
   - Total pepperoni pizza slices eaten: \( 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices/friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \).

Next, we need to figure out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type.

1. **Cheese Pizza:**
   - Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
   - Number of cheese pizzas needed: \( \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).

2. **Pepperoni Pizza:**
   - Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
   - Number of pepperoni pizzas needed: \( \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to get the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy.

- Total pizzas needed: \( 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \).

So, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 days, so:
3 miles/day × 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. That's 2 days, so:
5 miles/day × 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the miles from all the days together:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Snowballs Jay can make in an hour:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Snowballs that melt in an hour:**
   - Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour.
   - So, in one hour, \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt.

3. **Net snowballs made in an hour:**
   - Jay makes 20 snowballs but 8 melt.
   - Net snowballs made in one hour = \(20 - 8 = 12\).

4. **Time to make 60 snowballs:**
   - We need to find out how many hours it takes to make 60 snowballs.
   - If Jay makes 12 snowballs per hour, then the time required is \(\frac{60}{12} = 5\) hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Current Age of John:**
   - John is 28 years old now.

2. **Time Frame:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.

3. **John's Age 20 Years Ago:**
   - If John is 28 now, 20 years ago he was \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) years old.

4. **Relationship Between John's and Jim's Ages 20 Years Ago:**
   - The problem says that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let's call Jim's age 20 years ago \( J \).
   - So, \( 8 = 2J \).

5. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - \( J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

6. **Jim's Current Age:**
   - If Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago, then now he is \( 4 + 20 = 24 \) years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To figure out how many bandages the nurses started with, let's break down what happened each day and keep track of the bandages.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered 1 bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.
- So, the net change in bandages is: \( 50 - 38 = 12 \) bandages added.

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
- They didn't order any more bandages.
- So, the net change in bandages is: \( -28 \) bandages used.

**Third Day:**
- They used half a pack, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
- They ordered 2 bulk packs, which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
- So, the net change in bandages is: \( 100 - 25 = 75 \) bandages added.

Now, let's add up all the net changes over the three days:
- First day: \( +12 \) bandages
- Second day: \( -28 \) bandages
- Third day: \( +75 \) bandages

Total net change over the three days:
\[ 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 \] bandages added.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means that the number of bandages they started with plus the total net change equals 78 bandages.

So, the number of bandages they started with is:
\[ 78 - 59 = 19 \]

Therefore, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"Alright, let's figure out how much Jason earned over the two weeks.

1. For doing his laundry, he gets $3.00. He did it once, so that's $3.00.
2. For cleaning his room, he gets $1.50. He did it once, so that's $1.50.
3. For taking the trash to the curb, he gets $0.75. He did it twice, so that's $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
4. For emptying the dishwasher, he gets $0.50. He did it 6 times, so that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add it all up:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John bought 10 bottles for $600, so:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he did scotch. So, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:
\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find out how much John spent in total:

2. **Height of the First Floor:**
   - The first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison.
   - So, the height of the first floor is \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) inches.

3. **Height of the Second Floor:**
   - The height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor.
   - So, the height of the second floor is \( 420 - 180 = 240 \) inches.

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many shells the Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 700 by 0.40:

\[ 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \]

So, the Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after the Alphas have found theirs. We subtract the 280 shells from the total 700 shells:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Now, the Finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.60:

\[ 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

So, the Finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells the Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by the Alphas and the Finders from the total number of shells:

\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the Gogetters found 168 shells.

168"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Bernie has 4 dogs, and on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. This means the total distance all the dogs need to walk together is:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We know the distances for the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these distances together:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much John gets from the loan. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan for 40% of that. So, we calculate:

\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John gets a loan of $100,000.

Next, he uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. We need to find out how much that is:

\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, he uses $60,000 to pay off his debts.

Now, to find out how much money he has left over, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount:

\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, John has $40,000 left over after paying off his debts.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Deandre will earn from selling the tunas.

First, we need to add up the weights of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

So, the total weight is:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Next, we need to calculate how much money he will make. The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50.

So, the total earnings will be:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

"To figure out Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how much Trinity sells the magazines for. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them.
2. The price she bought the magazines for is $72.
3. To find the selling price, we multiply $72 by 11/8.
4. Then, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price.

Let's do the math:

Selling price = $72 * (11/8) = $99

Profit = Selling price - Buying price = $99 - $72 = $27

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the low setting is \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the medium setting is \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the high setting is \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, let's add up all the water removed:
\[ 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \]

So, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is:

"To figure out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we need to do a couple of simple steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many balloons they had at the start. They filled up 10 packs, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, we multiply 10 by 30:
   \[
   10 \times 30 = 300
   \]
   So, they started with 300 balloons.

2. Next, we need to find out how many balloons they used. By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:
   \[
   300 - 12 = 288
   \]

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons.

"To figure out how much medicine Saanvi needs for 8 doses, we first need to find out how much she needs for one dose.

For one dose, Saanvi mixes 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the second medicine is:
3 * 14 mL = 42 mL

Now, we add the amounts of both medicines to get the total for one dose:
14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

To find out how much medicine is needed for 8 doses, we multiply the total amount for one dose by 8:
56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

So, the total amount of medicine needed for 8 doses is 448 mL.

448 mL"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali teaches one class.
   - The capacity of Ali's class is 120 students.
   - So, the total capacity of Ali's school is 120 students.

2. **John's School:**
   - John has two classes.
   - Each of John's classes has a capacity that is 1/8 of Ali's class.
   - The capacity of each of John's classes is \( \frac{120}{8} = 15 \) students.
   - Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) students.

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - To find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacities of Ali's school and John's school.
   - The combined capacity is \( 120 + 30 = 150 \) students.

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

"To figure out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total amount Stephen owes, including interest:**
   - Stephen borrowed $300.
   - He promised to return it with an additional 2% interest.
   - The interest is 2% of $300, which is \( 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \) dollars.
   - So, the total amount he owes is \( 300 + 6 = 306 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total amount Stephen will have paid over the first 11 months:**
   - Stephen pays $25 per month for 11 months.
   - The total amount paid in 11 months is \( 25 \times 11 = 275 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month:**
   - The remaining amount is the total amount owed minus the amount already paid.
   - So, the remaining amount is \( 306 - 275 = 31 \) dollars.

Therefore, Stephen will pay \(\boxed{31}\) dollars in the twelfth month."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Jordan has 2 kids who need diapers.
2. Each kid needs 5 diaper changes a day.
3. So, for 2 kids, that's 5 changes per kid times 2 kids, which equals 10 diaper changes a day in total.
4. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 divided by 2, which is 5 diapers.
5. That means Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To figure out how far off Tim's guess was, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches at the base and 15 inches tall. So, the volume is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for the jelly beans:**
   Since the jelly beans only fill about 80% of the jar, the effective volume is:
   \[
   540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans:**
   Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches. So, the number of jelly beans is:
   \[
   \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \text{ jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans he estimates is:
   \[
   2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \text{ red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Find out how far off his guess was:**
   The actual number of red jelly beans is 900. So, the difference between his guess and the actual number is:
   \[
   900 - 864 = 36
   \]

So, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we did in high school math class.

1. **Initial number of people on the bus:**
   - When the bus left Chengli city, it had 20 people.

2. **First stop:**
   - 40 people got on the bus.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\).

3. **Second stop:**
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop got on at the second stop.
   - Number of people getting on at the second stop: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \).
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\).

4. **Third stop:**
   - The number of people on the bus doubled.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 \times 2 = 180\).

5. **Bus capacity:**
   - The bus can hold 200 people.
   - Number of empty seats left: \(200 - 180 = 20\).

"To figure out how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate how much she spent before the price increase:
- Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
- Each visit costs $2.
- She does this for 5 years.

So, the total cost for the first 5 years is:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/visit} \times 5 \text{ years} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the new cost of a visit after the price increase:
- The cost of one visit increased by 150%.
- 150% of $2 is \( 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \) dollars.
- So, the new cost of one visit is \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate how much she spent after the price increase:
- Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year.
- Each visit now costs $5.
- She does this for 3 more years.

So, the total cost for the next 3 years is:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} \times 3 \text{ years} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the costs from both periods to get the total amount spent:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} + 45 \text{ dollars} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

"To figure out how long it will take for all the students to try the escape room, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Number of Students:**
   - There are 10 students in each grade from 4th to 7th grade.
   - So, the total number of students is \(10 \times 4 = 40\).

2. **Number of Groups:**
   - Each group can have 8 students.
   - The number of groups needed is \(40 \div 8 = 5\).

3. **Total Time:**
   - Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room.
   - Therefore, the total time required is \(5 \times 45 = 225\) minutes.

So, it will take 225 minutes for all the students to try the escape room.

4 tables * $20/table = $80

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames, and each frame costs $10. So, we multiply the number of frames by the cost per frame:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

Now, we add the costs of the tables and the frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
$80 + $20 = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces, and the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. We need to find the length of the longer piece.

1. Let's call the length of the shorter piece \( x \) feet.
2. The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it is \( 4x \) feet.
3. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
   \[
   x + 4x = 40
   \]
4. Combine like terms:
   \[
   5x = 40
   \]
5. Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]
6. The length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.
7. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \):
   \[
   4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

So, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To figure out how much of the secret seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to know how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs. 

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can find out how many pounds he needs by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:
\[ \text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"To figure out how much fabric Luke needs, we first need to find the total width of all the windows. Each window is 35 inches wide, and there are 5 windows. So, we multiply 35 inches by 5:

\[ 35 \text{ inches/window} \times 5 \text{ windows} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

"To figure out how much a 36-minute call costs, we need to break it down into two parts because the price changes after 16 minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - So, 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. For the remaining 20 minutes (since 36 - 16 = 20), the cost is $0.20 per minute.
   - So, 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the costs of both parts together:
- $4.00 (first 16 minutes) + $4.00 (remaining 20 minutes) = $8.00

So, a 36-minute call would cost $8.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to set up the problem. Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. We also know that there are 5 people in her class, and each person gets 2 treats.

Let's use \( c \) to represent the number of cupcakes and \( b \) to represent the number of brownies.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The number of brownies is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 10 because there are 5 people and each gets 2 treats:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the manicure and pedicure cost together before the discount. The manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. She has 10 fingers, and the cost for nail art on each nail is $3. So, the total cost for the nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ 90 \]

   \[
   27 + 12 = 39
   \]
   So, Shelley has 39 paintings.
3. The problem also says that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has, we can find out how many paintings Kim has.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Charlie teaches tennis and charges $80 per hour for regular lessons. Today, he has 4 regular lessons, so we need to calculate how much he makes from these:

4 lessons × $80 per lesson = $320

For veterans, Charlie gives a 25% discount. So, the discounted rate is:

$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per lesson

Today, he has 2 lessons with veterans, so we need to calculate how much he makes from these:

2 lessons × $60 per lesson = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find out how much Charlie makes in total for the day:

$320 + $120 = $440

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

"To figure out how many novels Regina wrote this year, we need to understand that 9 novels are 3 quarters of the total number of novels she wrote this year. We can set up a simple equation to solve this:

Let \( x \) be the total number of novels Regina wrote this year. According to the problem, 9 is 3 quarters of \( x \):

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

2. **Grapes used by her brother:**
   Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice.
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Grapes used by their mother:**
   Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes.
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

4. **Total number of grapes:**
   To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add up all the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother.
   \[
   6 + 30 + 48 = 84
   \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:
\[
\boxed{84}

"To figure out how many teachers were at school last Friday, we need to do a bit of math. We start with the total number of teachers, which is 82. Then, we subtract the number of teachers who were sick, which is 13. After that, we add the number of substitute teachers who came in, which is 9.

So, the calculation goes like this:
82 (total teachers) - 13 (sick teachers) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 78 teachers at school.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cost of Pasta**: Bud uses one box of pasta each week, and each box costs $1.00.
2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese**: He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week.
3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese**: He spends twice as much on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese. So, the cost of gruyere cheese is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up the costs for one week:
- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheddar Cheese: $3.00
- Gruyere Cheese: $6.00

Total cost per week:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52 to find the yearly cost:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

520.00"
"To figure out what percentage of the day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total time to clean all classrooms:**
   - Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean.
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - Total time = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

2. **Total available working time in a day:**
   - The custodian works 8 hours a day.
   - 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.

3. **Total available working time over 5 days:**
   - 5 days * 480 minutes/day = 2400 minutes.

4. **Average time spent cleaning per day:**
   - Total time to clean all classrooms = 1200 minutes.
   - Number of days = 5.
   - Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day.

5. **Percentage of the day spent cleaning:**
   - Total working time per day = 480 minutes.
   - Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes.
   - Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%.

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms.

50%"
"To figure out how many bookcases Elly needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. So, the total for the middle shelves is:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. So, the bottom shelf can hold:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. So, the top shelf can hold:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
   \]

4. Now, let's add up the total number of books each bookcase can hold:
   \[
   20 \text{ (middle shelves)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
   \]

5. Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:
   \[
   \frac{110}{55} = 2
   \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen is 12 eggs, five dozens would be:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, the cost of one dozen eggs is $2.40. So, the total cost for five dozens is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she sells each set of 3 eggs for $1, her total earnings from selling all the eggs will be:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20.00 \text{ dollars} \]

To find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ 20.00 - 12.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how many white hats Skyler has.

1. First, we know that Skyler has 100 hats in total.
2. Half of the hats are red, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]
3. After accounting for the red hats, the remaining hats are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]
4. Out of these remaining hats, 3/5 are blue, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]
5. The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Archie pays for the bag of beef jerky when it's on sale. The original price is $18.00, but it's $3.00 off. So, the sale price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of jerky costs. There are 30 sticks in the bag, and the bag costs $15.00. So, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \).

The problem tells us that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. This means the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes is 116. So, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, the number of strawberry cubes is 20. Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes. We use the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is 96.

"To figure out the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to do a couple of simple calculations.

First, we find out how many games she has played in total. Since she plays 40 games each year and has been playing for 4 years:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we calculate the total points. If she scores 21 points in each game, then for 160 games:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:

"To figure out how many phone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come to the dealership, 1 car is sold. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs:
\[ 15 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ customers per car} = 30 \text{ customers} \]

Next, we know that for every 25 phone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership. So, to get 30 customers, Jason needs:
\[ 30 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ phone calls per customer} = 750 \text{ phone calls} \]

So, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - Each person has a flashlight, and there are 4 people.
   - Each room has 2 flashlights, and there are 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 + (2 * 8) = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the 8 rooms have 5 medium candles each.
   - Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms.
   - Total small candles = 4 small candles/room * 4 rooms = 16 small candles
   - Total medium candles = 5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms = 20 medium candles
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36 = 56

So, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. John takes 5 minutes to solve the first side of the Rubik's cube.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. Once the fifth side is solved, the sixth side is automatically solved, so it doesn't add any extra time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

Next, the problem also says there are half as many helmets as footballs. So, the number of footballs is:
\[ \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, to find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours Tim works in a week. He works 6 hours each day for 5 days. So, we multiply 6 hours by 5 days:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to convert these hours into minutes because each call takes 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 30 hours by 60 minutes per hour:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute calls Tim can handle in 1800 minutes. We divide 1800 minutes by 15 minutes per call:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls} \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"To figure out how much longer it will take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish, we need to do a bit of math.

First, let's calculate the total drying time for the old varnish:
- Each painting takes 7 minutes to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \( 7 \text{ minutes} \times 6 = 42 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the total drying time for the new varnish:
- Each painting takes 12 minutes to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \( 12 \text{ minutes} \times 6 = 72 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \( 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 4 plants that each need 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - Crista has 8 plants that each need 1 cup of water.
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 20 plants in total.
   - She has 4 plants that need half a cup and 8 plants that need 1 cup.
   - The rest of the plants: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\) plants.
   - Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups.

Now, let's add up the total water needed for all the plants:

"To figure out how long it will take Phineas Frog to get back home, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the part on land and the part in water.

1. **Distance on Land**: Half of 200 yards is 100 yards.
2. **Speed on Land**: Phineas hops at 20 yards per minute.
   - Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
   - Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

3. **Distance in Water**: The other half of 200 yards is also 100 yards.
4. **Speed in Water**: Phineas swims at 10 yards per minute.
   - Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
   - Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Now, we add the time for both parts of the journey:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water
- Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times as many kernels pop as in the first 30 seconds. So, \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times as many kernels pop as in the first 30 seconds. So, \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of what it was in the previous 30 seconds. So, \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels pop.

"To figure out how many lemons Tim needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Lemons for the Pool Party:**
   - Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of lemon juice for 1 gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - So, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice, he will need \(4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

2. **Lemons for Allen's Extra Gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - So, he will need \(2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}\).

3. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen's extra gallon: 12 lemons
   - Total: \(24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}\)

"To figure out how much dog food the kennel needs for a week, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much food the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- So, the German Shepherds eat 5 kg/dog/day * 3 dogs = 15 kg/day.

Next, we need to find out how much food the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, the Bulldogs eat 3 kg/dog/day * 2 dogs = 6 kg/day.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both types of dogs to get the total daily consumption:
- Total daily consumption = 15 kg/day (German Shepherds) + 6 kg/day (Bulldogs) = 21 kg/day.

Finally, to find out how much food is needed for a week, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
- Total weekly consumption = 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

So, the kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals:
   - There are 10 animals, and each has 2 legs.
   - So, \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs from the 2-legged animals.

2. Next, let's calculate the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals:
   - There are 15 animals, and each has 4 legs.
   - So, \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs from the 4-legged animals.

3. Now, let's add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
   - Total legs = \(20 + 60 = 80\) legs.

4. Finally, to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
   - Total pairs of legs = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) pairs.

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40.

"To figure out how many red blocks there are, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know there are 4 blue blocks.
2. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so that means there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

Now, let's add up the blue and yellow blocks:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} = 12 \text{ blocks} \]

To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks in the tower:
\[ 32 \text{ (total blocks)} - 12 \text{ (blue and yellow blocks)} = 20 \text{ red blocks} \]

So, the number of red blocks is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **First Part of the Journey:**
   - Elvis drives west for 5 hours.
   - He drives at an average speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - To find the distance he travels, we use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - So, the distance he travels west is:
     \[
     18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Second Part of the Journey:**
   - Elvis then turns around and drives east for 8 hours.
   - He still drives at an average speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Using the same formula, the distance he travels east is:
     \[
     18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Net Distance from Home:**
   - To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to consider the direction he traveled.
   - He first went 90 miles west, and then 144 miles east.
   - The net distance is the difference between the distance he traveled east and the distance he traveled west:
     \[
     144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles}
     \]

So, Elvis is 54 miles east of his house.

"Okay, let's figure out how much the boat is worth after three years of depreciation.

1. **First Year:**
   - The boat starts at $9000.
   - It depreciates by 30%.
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $6300.
   - It depreciates by another 30%.
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $4410.
   - It depreciates by 20%.
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

"To figure out how many pink candies are in the bag, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 54 red candies.
2. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
3. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
   \[
   \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

So, the number of pink candies is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Helen paid for the hotel. She stayed for 3 nights, and each night cost $80. So, we multiply the number of nights by the cost per night:
\[ 3 \text{ nights} \times \$80 \text{ per night} = \$240 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the bus rides. Each bus ride costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, 10% of $80 is:
\[ 0.10 \times \$80 = \$8 \]
Helen rode the bus 7 times, so we multiply the cost of one bus ride by the number of rides:
\[ 7 \text{ rides} \times \$8 \text{ per ride} = \$56 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, Helen paid a total of \$296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip.

3. Since Mazie gave all 52 marbles to Dallas and Darla, and Dallas received 25 marbles, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:
   \[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total weight of everything in the car. The car itself weighs 1200 pounds.
2. The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
3. John has two young children, and each child weighs 75 pounds. So, the total weight of the children is 75 pounds + 75 pounds = 150 pounds.

Now, let's add all these weights together:
- Car: 1200 pounds
- Luggage: 250 pounds
- Children: 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

The problem says that the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. So, we need to find 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs 16 pounds of force to push the car.

Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma. So, to find Emma's age, we add 16 years to Mia's age:

Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years

Now, to find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and divide by 2:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

So, the average of their ages is 48."

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Daily Feed Consumption for One Pig:**
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
   - So, one pig eats 4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day.

2. **Daily Feed Consumption for Five Pigs:**
   - If one pig eats 8 pounds/day, then five pigs eat 8 pounds/day * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Weekly Feed Consumption for Five Pigs:**
   - If the pigs eat 40 pounds/day, then in a week (7 days), they eat 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds/week.

4. **Feed Left After a Week:**
   - Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
   - After a week, the pigs will have eaten 280 pounds.
   - So, the feed left after a week is 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

13.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many days Josh is open in a week. He's closed on Sunday and Wednesday, so he's open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday).

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars each day he's open, we multiply 3 cars/day by 5 days/week:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how much he earns in a week. He gets paid $4 for each car, so we multiply the number of cars by the pay rate:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

"Okay, let's figure out how many cookies Randy has now.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **Eating 3 cookies for an early day snack (one of each flavor):**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

3. **Eating 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

4. **Giving 2 sugar cookies to his friends:**
   - Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

5. **Baking 4 of each flavor for dinner:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies:
- Total cookies = 10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

So, Randy has 23 cookies now.

"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them to a buyer who is willing to pay $5 for each of the first 6 toy soldiers and $7 for each of the other 6 toy soldiers.

First, let's calculate how much he will earn from the first 6 toy soldiers:
\[ 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$5 \text{ per toy} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate how much he will earn from the other 6 toy soldiers:
\[ 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$7 \text{ per toy} = \$42 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both parts to find the total earnings:
\[ \$30 + \$42 = \$72 \]

So, Matthew would earn \$72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer.

72"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many holes the dog dug while Nate was on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate was gone for 14 days. So, we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets back, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes each night. So, the net number of holes Nate fills each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School, the neighboring school, enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we need to do a bit of math.

First, let's figure out how many students Butler High School enrolls:
\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools:
\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To figure out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies. 

Here's the math:

- Total cookies: 7995
- Rainbow cookies: 2595
- Oatmeal cookies: 3075

First, subtract the rainbow cookies from the total:
7995 - 2595 = 5400

Next, subtract the oatmeal cookies from the result:
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

But Igor made some mistakes:
- He gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he got \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he got \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- He picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7, but he lost some on the way.

We know that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. Let's set up an equation to find out how many beakers he lost.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. So, the number of beakers he actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

The total number of items on the lab bench is:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To figure out how many screws James will have left over, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg needs 2 screws.
3. So, each table needs \(4 \times 2 = 8\) screws.
4. James is putting together 4 tables, so he needs \(4 \times 8 = 32\) screws in total.
5. James has 40 screws.

Now, we subtract the number of screws he needs from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

So, James will have 8 screws left over.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much each girl raised:

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra. So, Kim raised:
   \[
   430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah. So, Maryam raised:
   \[
   300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

\[
430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Vanessa's Distance**: Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. **Aaron's Distance**: Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did. That means Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. **Aaron's Time**: Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.

Now, let's figure out how fast Aaron and Vanessa run.

- **Aaron's Speed**: Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. So, his speed is:
  \[
  \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}}
  \]
  This means Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes.

- **Vanessa's Speed**: Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. So, Vanessa runs 1 mile in:
  \[
  \text{Vanessa's speed} = 8 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles.

- **Vanessa's Time**: Since Vanessa runs 1 mile in 16 minutes, for 4 miles:
  \[
  \text{Vanessa's time} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes}
  \]

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To figure out how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate how much line is needed for the whole dock. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3:

\[ 200 \times 3 = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the 6 feet he already has from the 600 feet he needs:

\[ 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

594"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much one reservation makes. Each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

They also order a $5 bottle of wine, so the total for one reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the restaurant makes in one night. They get 6 reservations a night, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the restaurant makes:

"To figure out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow a few steps:

1. First, we need to find out the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. Next, we calculate the profit. The vendor made a 25% profit on the total cost. To find the profit, we multiply the total cost by 25% (or 0.25):
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20
   \]

3. Now, we add the profit to the total cost to get the total selling price:
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

4. Finally, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2
   \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Dora's Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - So, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **James's Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - So, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **John's Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is 18 years old, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old now.

4. **Youngest Son's Age:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is 37 years old now, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Ana's Peeling Rate:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Ana can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Jane's Peeling Rate:**
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Jane can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Difference in the Number of Oranges Peeled:**
   - To find out how many more oranges Ana peels than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the cost of the new radiator is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find out how much he pays for the radiator, we need to calculate 80% of $400 and subtract that from $400.

80% of $400 is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the discount is $320. Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours. To find the total cost for the mechanic, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

So, the mechanic charges $150 for the installation.

Finally, to find the total amount Mark paid, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have a total of 70 legs. We need to figure out how many of these animals are chickens.

1. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.

2. **Write the equations based on the information given:**
   - The total number of animals is 20:
     \[
     c + k = 20
     \]
   - The total number of legs is 70:
     \[
     2c + 4k = 70
     \]

3. **Simplify the second equation:**
   - Divide the second equation by 2 to make it easier to solve:
     \[
     c + 2k = 35
     \]

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - We now have:
     \[
     c + k = 20
     \]
     \[
     c + 2k = 35
     \]
   - Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):
     \[
     (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
     \]
     \[
     k = 15
     \]

5. **Find the number of chickens:**
   - Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
     \[
     c + 15 = 20
     \]
     \[
     c = 5
     \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
