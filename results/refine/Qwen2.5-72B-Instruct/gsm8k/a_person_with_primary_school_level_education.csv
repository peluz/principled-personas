"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. 

Every morning, Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. So, she uses a total of:
3 + 4 = 7 eggs

This means the number of eggs left to sell is:
16 - 7 = 9 eggs

Janet sells each egg for $2. So, the money she makes from selling the eggs is:
9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To make a robe, you need 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so you need 1 bolt of white fiber. 

Now, let's add them together:
2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts in total.

So, the total number of bolts needed is:
3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, Josh bought a house for $80,000. Then, he spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total amount he spent is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, the repairs made the house worth 150% more than it was before. To find out how much more, we need to calculate 150% of $80,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, to find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the total amount he spent from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. James runs 3 sprints each time he goes out. Each sprint is 60 meters long. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, we find out how many meters he runs in one session:
3 sprints × 60 meters = 180 meters

Now, we need to find out how many meters he runs in a week:
180 meters × 3 sessions = 540 meters

So, James runs 540 meters a week.

540"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed every day. So, we need to find out how many cups of feed all the chickens need together in one day.

First, we multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken needs:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs 60 cups of feed for all her chickens in one day.

Next, we know that Wendi gives the chickens some feed in the morning and some in the afternoon. In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. We need to add these amounts to find out how much feed she has already given:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cups of feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal. We do this by subtracting the amount of feed already given from the total amount needed:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. Each glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of $5. 

First, let's find out how much 60% of $5 is:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

So, every second glass costs $3.

Now, let's break it down:
- For every pair of glasses, the first one costs $5 and the second one costs $3.
- The total cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, that's 8 pairs of glasses. So, we need to multiply the cost of one pair by 8:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep. That's easy to remember!

Next, we're told that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we need to multiply the number of sheep in Seattle by 4:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]
So, Charleston has 80 sheep.

Now, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we need to multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2:
\[ 80 \times 2 = 160 \]
So, Toulouse has 160 sheep.

Finally, we need to find out how many sheep there are in total in all three places. We add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse:
\[ 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
260"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. First, we need to find out how much of the file Carla downloads before the computer restarts. The file is 200 GB, and she downloads 40% of it. To find 40% of 200 GB, we do:
   \[
   200 \text{ GB} \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB}
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how long it takes to download 80 GB. Carla downloads at a speed of 2 GB per minute. So, to find the time, we do:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. After downloading 80 GB, the computer restarts and takes 20 minutes. So, we add those 20 minutes to the time it took to download 80 GB:
   \[
   40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. Finally, Carla has to start the download all over again. The whole file is 200 GB, and she downloads at 2 GB per minute. So, to find the time to download the whole file again, we do:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. Now, we add the time it took to download 80 GB, the time for the restart, and the time to download the whole file again:
   \[
   60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the total time it takes to download the file is:
160"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes, we multiply the time by the speed:
\[ 3 \, \text{hours} \times 60 \, \text{miles per hour} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home.

Next, John tries to get back home in 4 hours. But he spends the first 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he doesn't move at all during that time.

After the 2 hours, he drives for half an hour (which is 0.5 hours) at 30 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes in that time, we multiply the time by the speed:
\[ 0.5 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles per hour} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

So, he covers 15 miles in the first half-hour after the traffic.

Then, he drives for the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes in that time, we multiply the time by the speed:
\[ 1.5 \, \text{hours} \times 80 \, \text{miles per hour} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, he covers 120 miles in the last 1.5 hours.

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the distance he initially traveled away from home:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Eliza made this week.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at $10 each hour.
   - So, 40 hours * $10 = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Eliza worked 5 extra hours.
   - Overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular pay, so 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - So, 5 hours * $12 = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Add the regular pay and the overtime pay.
   - $400 + $60 = $460.

So, Eliza made $460 this week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads. That's like having 60 stickers.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times as many as the first month.
   - So, we need to multiply 60 by 3.
   - \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \).
   - That means 180 downloads in the second month.

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - To find 30% of 180, we can think of it as 30 out of 100 parts of 180.
   - \( 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \).
   - So, 54 downloads were reduced.
   - Now, we subtract 54 from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month.
   - \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).
   - That means 126 downloads in the third month.

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add up the downloads from each month.
   - \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're doing a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much Toula spent on each type of pastry:

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, for 3 dozen, she paid: 3 × $68 = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, for 2 dozen, she paid: 2 × $80 = $160.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, for 6 dozen, she paid: 6 × $55 = $330.

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Toula spent:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330
- Total cost = $694

So, the total cost is $694.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **Initial Cost**: Carlos needs to spend $90 to plant the lemon tree.
2. **Lemons per Year**: The tree will grow 7 lemons each year.
3. **Price per Lemon**: Each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
4. **Cost to Water and Feed**: It costs $3 each year to water and feed the tree.

First, let's figure out how much money Carlos makes from selling lemons each year:
- 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Next, let's find out how much money Carlos spends each year to water and feed the tree:
- $3

Now, let's calculate how much money Carlos makes after paying for watering and feeding the tree each year:
- $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

So, Carlos makes $7.5 each year after all the costs.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back the $90 he spent to plant the tree, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
- $90 ÷ $7.5 = 12

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class.

1. **First, we know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left at the end.**

2. **Before she got to the orange house, she had more vacuum cleaners.** She sold half of what she had left at the orange house, so before she got there, she must have had 5 vacuum cleaners plus the 5 she sold. That means she had 10 vacuum cleaners before the orange house.

3. **Before she got to the red house, she had even more vacuum cleaners.** She sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house, so before she got there, she must have had 10 vacuum cleaners plus the 2 she sold. That means she had 12 vacuum cleaners before the red house.

4. **Before she got to the green house, she had even more vacuum cleaners.** She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so the 12 vacuum cleaners she had before the red house were two-thirds of what she started with. If 12 is two-thirds, then one-third is 6 (because 12 divided by 2 is 6). So, she must have started with 18 vacuum cleaners (because 6 times 3 is 18).

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **Total number of students in the dance class:** 20 students.

2. **Students who enrolled in contemporary dance:**
   - 20% of 20 students.
   - 20% is the same as 20 out of 100, which is 1/5.
   - So, 1/5 of 20 students = 20 ÷ 5 = 4 students.

3. **Students left after contemporary dance:**
   - Total students - Students in contemporary dance = 20 - 4 = 16 students.

4. **Students who enrolled in jazz dance:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students.
   - 25% is the same as 25 out of 100, which is 1/4.
   - So, 1/4 of 16 students = 16 ÷ 4 = 4 students.

5. **Students left after jazz dance:**
   - Remaining students - Students in jazz dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students.

6. **Students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - The rest of the students = 12 students.

7. **Percentage of students in hip-hop dance:**
   - To find the percentage, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and then multiply by 100.
   - (12 ÷ 20) × 100 = 0.6 × 100 = 60%.

So, the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

The merchant has two choices:
1. Buy jewelry worth $5,000.
2. Buy electronic gadgets worth $8,000.

The financial advisor says:
- The jewelry market will go up by 2.5%.
- The electronic gadgets market will go up by 1.2%.

To find out which one will make more money, we need to calculate how much each will be worth after the market goes up.

### Jewelry:
- Initial cost: $5,000
- Market increase: 2.5%
- To find the increase, we multiply $5,000 by 2.5% (which is 0.025):
  \[
  5000 \times 0.025 = 125
  \]
- So, the profit from jewelry is $125.

### Electronic Gadgets:
- Initial cost: $8,000
- Market increase: 1.2%
- To find the increase, we multiply $8,000 by 1.2% (which is 0.012):
  \[
  8000 \times 0.012 = 96
  \]
- So, the profit from electronic gadgets is $96.

Now, we compare the profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry because it will make more money.

The maximum profit is:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

Two trains start from the same place, San Rafael. They both go west for 80 miles. Then, the next day, they both go north for 150 miles. We need to find out how far each train traveled in total.

First, we add the miles they traveled west:
80 miles

Then, we add the miles they traveled north:
150 miles

Now, we add these two numbers together to find the total distance:
80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

So, each train traveled 230 miles in total.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jill makes in a year. We need to do this step by step.

First, we find out how much she makes each week from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She gets $20 for each hour.
- So, 35 hours times $20 is 35 * 20 = $700 each week from teaching.

Next, we find out how much she makes each week from being a cheerleading coach:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She gets $30 for each hour.
- So, 15 hours times $30 is 15 * 30 = $450 each week from coaching.

Now, we add the money she makes from teaching and coaching each week:
- $700 from teaching + $450 from coaching = $1150 each week.

Finally, we find out how much she makes in a year:
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- So, 50 weeks times $1150 is 50 * 1150 = $57,500 in a year.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week.
3. So, in one week, Claire uses 3 eggs/day × 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
4. We need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks.
5. So, 21 eggs/week × 4 weeks = 84 eggs.
6. Now, we need to convert 84 eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
7. So, 84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and then she walked 2 more miles in another hour. So, she has walked 6 miles in 2 hours.

Now, she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the whole 12 miles. To find out how long she should take to finish the whole trail, we can use this simple idea:

If she wants to go 12 miles at 4 miles per hour, she should take:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, she needs to finish the whole 12 miles in 3 hours. She has already used 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at 6 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we have 10 liters of orange drink. This drink is mostly water—two-thirds of it is water. So, we need to find out how much water is in 10 liters of orange drink:
\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

But, oh no! We spill 1 liter of the orange drink. So, we only have 9 liters of orange drink left. Now, we need to find out how much water is in these 9 liters:
\[ \text{Water in 9 liters of orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink. This drink is also mostly water—three-fifths of it is water. So, we need to find out how much water is in 15 liters of pineapple drink:
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we mix the 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total amount of the mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

To find out how much water is in the 24 liters of the mixture, we add the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

3 customers × 1 DVD each = 3 DVDs

Next, he had 2 customers who each bought 2 DVDs. So, that's:
2 customers × 2 DVDs each = 4 DVDs

Finally, the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs. So, that's:
3 customers × 0 DVDs each = 0 DVDs

Now, let's add up all the DVDs:
3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The candle burns for 4 hours, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Each hour, the candle gets 2 centimeters shorter. So, we need to find out how much shorter the candle will be after 4 hours.

1. First, we count the hours: 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is 1 hour, 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is 2 hours, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is 3 hours, and 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. So, the candle burns for 4 hours.
2. Next, we know the candle gets 2 centimeters shorter each hour. So, we multiply the number of hours by 2 centimeters:
   4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Kyle bought a book for $19.50, but this price was after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price. We need to find out what the original price was.

1. First, we know that 75% of the original price is $19.50.
2. To find 100% of the original price, we need to divide $19.50 by 75% (which is the same as 0.75 in decimal form).

So, we do the division:
\[ \text{Original Price} = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the math:
\[ \text{Original Price} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to add up the cost of all the things Marie bought, except for the pizza. 

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- Each pack of milk costs $3, and she bought 5 packs, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Each apple costs $1.50, and she bought 4 apples, so that's \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these up:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the money she spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the money spent on pizza by the cost of one box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\].

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much Mishka spent on each type of clothing:

1. **Shorts:**
   - One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs.
   - So, the total cost for shorts is \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \) dollars.

2. **Pants:**
   - One pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs.
   - So, the total cost for pants is \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \) dollars.

3. **Shoes:**
   - One pair of shoes costs $42.00.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs.
   - So, the total cost for shoes is \( 3 \times 42.00 = 126.00 \) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Mishka spent:

- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = \( 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00 = 243.00 \) dollars.

So, Mishka spent 243 dollars on all the clothing items.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **Find out how many servings Cynthia eats in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - So, in 60 days, she will eat:
     \[
     1 \text{ serving/night} \times 60 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs:**
   - Each carton has 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - So, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Henry went on a 60-mile bike trip. He made two stops:
1. His first stop was after he rode 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before he finished the trip.

To find out how many miles he rode between his first and second stops, we need to figure out where his second stop was. Since the trip is 60 miles long and he stopped 15 miles before the end, his second stop was at:
60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know:
- His first stop was at 20 miles.
- His second stop was at 45 miles.

To find out how many miles he rode between these two stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:
45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry rode 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. We know that one pair of high heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair. So, we need to multiply $33 by 2:
   \[
   33 \times 2 = 66
   \]
3. Now, we add the cost of both pairs of high heels together:
   \[
   33 + 66 = 99
   \]
4. The problem says that the two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, if the high heels cost $99, the boots must cost $5 more than $99:
   \[
   99 + 5 = 104

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in a special ratio, which is 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen has 11 parts.

2. We also know that together, their ages add up to 162. So, if we add Darrell's 7 parts and Allen's 11 parts, we get 18 parts in total.

3. Now, we need to find out what one part is. We do this by dividing the total age (162) by the total number of parts (18):
   \[
   162 \div 18 = 9
   \]
   So, one part is 9 years.

4. Now, we can find out how old Darrell and Allen are:
   - Darrell's age: \( 7 \times 9 = 63 \) years
   - Allen's age: \( 11 \times 9 = 99 \) years

5. The question asks for Allen's age 10 years from now. So, we add 10 years to Allen's current age:
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109

So, Allen will be 109 years old 10 years from now.

3. The third friend says there are 25% more than 80. To find 25% of 80, we can think of it as 80 divided by 4, which is 20. So, 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses:
- First guess: 80
- Second guess: 60
- Third guess: 100

To find the average, we add these numbers together and then divide by 3:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]
\[ 240 \div 3 = 80 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

John has 10 dogs. Each dog needs 0.5 hours (which is the same as 30 minutes) of walking and taking care of every day.

First, we need to find out how many hours John spends on all the dogs each day. We do this by multiplying the number of dogs by the time each dog needs:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on the dogs each week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily hours by 7:

Gretchen has 110 coins in total. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's figure out how many of each she has.

1. First, let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \).
2. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

Now, we know the total number of coins is 110. So, we can write this as:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Combine the \( S \) terms:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

2. Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the \( 2S \) term:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, let's find out how many gold coins she has:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

Half of 40 is 20.

Now, Aaron has 5 more than this, so we add 5 to 20:

20 + 5 = 25

So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem says that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels:

25 - 2 = 23

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 60 yogurts. The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. So, we need to figure out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:

John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as long as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's add up all the time he spends running:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time running in a week:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know he runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total distance by the total time:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to figure out how fast Dana can run and walk:**
   - We know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running, so running is twice as fast as skipping.
   - So, Dana can run at \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.
   - Running is four times faster than walking, so walking is one-fourth as fast as running.
   - So, Dana can walk at \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how much time Dana spends running and walking:**
   - Dana has 6 hours in total.
   - She spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for \(6 \div 3 = 2\) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she walks for \(6 \times 2 \div 3 = 4\) hours.

3. **Now, let's calculate how far Dana travels while running and walking:**
   - Running: She runs at 6 miles per hour for 2 hours, so she runs \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.
   - Walking: She walks at 1.5 miles per hour for 4 hours, so she walks \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles.

4. **Finally, we add the distances together to find the total distance:**

The dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, if he bought 5 blue ties, he must have bought:

\[
5 \times 2 = 10

So, John bought 10 red ties.

Now, we need to find out how much each red tie costs. The problem says that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, we need to find 50% of $40 and add it to $40:

"Okay, let's count the raspberries! 

First, we have 6 clusters of raspberries, and each cluster has 20 raspberries. So, we need to multiply 6 by 20:
6 * 20 = 120 raspberries

Then, we have 67 more raspberries scattered around the bush. We need to add these to the 120 raspberries we already counted:
120 + 67 = 187 raspberries

So, the total number of raspberries is:
187"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 25 oranges in the basket.
2. One of these oranges is bad.
3. Twenty percent of the oranges are unripe. To find out how many that is, we can do a simple calculation: 20% of 25 is 5 oranges.
4. There are also 2 sour oranges.

Now, let's add up all the oranges that are not good:
- 1 bad orange
- 5 unripe oranges
- 2 sour oranges

So, 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges are not good.

To find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the number of not-good oranges from the total number of oranges:
25 - 8 = 17

So, there are 17 good oranges.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch. Then, she pays $800 for the jeweler to make it. So, we add these two amounts together:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet has to pay 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we do:
\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the brooch:
\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, Janet paid a total of $1430.

1430"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Marcy gets a special reward for working a long time at her job. If she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000 every year after she stops working. But if she works for 30 years, she gets a smaller reward.

For the first 20 years, she doesn't get any special reward. But after 20 years, for each extra year she works, she gets 5% more of the $50,000. So, if she works for 30 years, she works 10 extra years after the first 20 years.

Now, let's count how much 5% of $50,000 is:
5% of $50,000 = $50,000 ÷ 100 × 5 = $2,500

Since she works 10 extra years, she gets 10 times $2,500:
10 × $2,500 = $25,000

So, if Marcy works for 30 years, her annual pension will be $25,000.

$25,000"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - Aleena pays $140 each month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - So, for the first half, she pays: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The price goes down by 10%.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 140 \div 10 = 14 \) dollars.
   - So, the new price is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars per month.
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - So, for the second half, she pays: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total for the Year:**
   - Add the amounts for the first and second halves of the year.
   - Total amount: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

1. **First, we need to find out how many miles Sophia's car can go with one gallon of gas.**
   - Sophia drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas.
   - So, we divide the miles by the gallons: 100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many miles Sophia can drive with a full tank of gas.**
   - The car's tank holds 12 gallons.
   - We multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank: 25 miles per gallon × 12 gallons = 300 miles.

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Time spent in one session:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
   - Then he reads for half as long, which is 1 hour (because half of 2 is 1).

   So, in one session, he spends:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Time spent in one week:**
   - Jim does this 3 times a week.
   - So, in one week, he spends:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

3. **Time spent in 4 weeks:**
   - In 4 weeks, he spends:
   \[
   9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each team also has a coach.

So, for each school:
- Girls' team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people
- Boys' team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people

Now, let's add the people from both teams for one school:
- 6 (girls' team) + 6 (boys' team) = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, we need to multiply the number of people from one school by 4:
- 12 people per school * 4 schools = 48 people

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48.

48"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 175 diamonds.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. So, we subtract 35 from 175:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 rubies.
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we multiply 140 by 2:
   \[
   140 \times 2 = 280
   \]
   So, there are 280 emeralds.

Now, let's add up all the gems:

1. First, we know there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school.
2. The problem says there are twice as many boys as girls. So, if there are 60 girls, then there must be 2 times 60 boys. That means there are 120 boys.
3. Now, let's add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of students. So, 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.
4. The problem also tells us that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find out how many teachers there are, we need to divide the total number of students by 5. So, 180 students ÷ 5 = 36 teachers.

So, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

Bailey gets $5 every week for 8 weeks. So, we need to find out how much money she got in total from her allowance. We do this by multiplying:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, Bailey got $40 from her allowance over 8 weeks.

Now, we know that at the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has $100 in total. This $100 includes the money she started with and the $40 she got from her allowance. To find out how much money she started with, we need to subtract the $40 from the $100:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to know how many classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays, she teaches 5 classes each day. There are 5 weekdays, so:
  5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is:
25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes

Next, we need to find out how many students are in all these classes:
- Each class has 15 students.
- So, for 33 classes, the total number of students is:
  33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students

Now, we need to calculate how much money Judy makes from all these students:
- She charges $15.00 per student.
- So, the total money she makes is:
  495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

1. First, we need to find out how much Shiela paid for all the cell phones without any extra money (interest).
   - Shiela bought 5 cell phones.
   - Each cell phone costs $150.
   - So, the total cost is \( 5 \times 150 = 750 \) dollars.

2. Next, we need to find out how much extra money (interest) Shiela has to pay.
   - The interest is 2% of the total cost.
   - To find 2% of $750, we do \( 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \) dollars.

3. Now, we add the extra money (interest) to the total cost to find out how much Shiela needs to pay in total.
   - Total cost with interest is \( 750 + 15 = 765 \) dollars.

4. Finally, we need to find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months.
   - We divide the total amount by 3.

- Petunias cost $1.87, which rounds to $2.
- Begonias cost $2.12, which rounds to $2.

Next, we calculate how much Artie makes from each type of flower:
- For marigolds: 12 pots * $3 per pot = $36
- For petunias: 9 pots * $2 per pot = $18
- For begonias: 17 pots * $2 per pot = $34

Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels. The top level (the 4th level) has 16 square feet. Each level below it has twice the square footage of the level above it. So, let's figure out the square footage for each level:

1. **4th level:** 16 square feet
2. **3rd level:** 16 × 2 = 32 square feet
3. **2nd level:** 32 × 2 = 64 square feet
4. **1st level:** 64 × 2 = 128 square feet

Now, let's add up all the square footage:
16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how much dog food the puppy needs for the first 180 days. The vet said to give the puppy 1 cup of food each day. So, for 180 days, the puppy will need:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much dog food the puppy needs for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so the remaining days are:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]
The vet said to give the puppy 2 cups of food each day for these remaining days. So, for 185 days, the puppy will need:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of dog food needed for the whole year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Each bag of dog food has 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia needs, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:

First, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Each package has 3 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, we need \( 18 \div 3 = 6 \) packages.
- So, the cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Now, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Each package has 2 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, we need \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \) packages.
- So, the cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

To find out how much money Vincent saves, we subtract the cheaper cost from the more expensive cost:
- The more expensive cost is $15.

The team played 22 games in total. We know they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's use some simple math to figure out how many games they won.

1. Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \).
2. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).
3. The total number of games they played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is 22.

So, we can write this as:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Now, let's solve for \( L \):
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Now, to find out how many games they won:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

The team won 15 games.

   - Sylvie earns $600 every month.

2. **Next, we need to find out how much she earns in a year.**
   - To find her yearly salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).
   - So, \( 600 \times 12 = 7200 \) dollars per year.

3. **Now, we need to figure out what happens after 5 years.**
   - After 5 years, the company gives her a raise of 10% of her initial salary.
   - 10% of $600 is \( 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \) dollars.
   - So, her new monthly salary is \( 600 + 60 = 660 \) dollars.

4. **We need to find out her new yearly salary after the raise.**
   - To find her new yearly salary, we multiply her new monthly salary by 12.
   - So, \( 660 \times 12 = 7920 \) dollars per year.

5. **Finally, we need to know what her salary will be after 3 more years.**
   - The problem says the raise only happens once after 5 years, so her salary stays the same for the next 3 years.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class!

1. James is 10 years old.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **Lee's Time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Gerald's Original Time:**
   - Lee used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - So, if Lee runs in 38 seconds, Gerald must run in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

3. **Gerald's Improved Time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - If his speed is 10% faster, he can run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - To find 90% of 40 seconds, we multiply 40 by 0.90.
   - 40 × 0.90 = 36 seconds.

So, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to find out how many cats there are:**
   - We know there are 60 dogs.
   - For every dog, there are 2 cats.
   - So, if there are 60 dogs, then there are \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) cats.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many dogs and cats there are together:**
   - We have 60 dogs and 120 cats.
   - So, the total number of dogs and cats is \( 60 + 120 = 180 \).

3. **Now, we need to find out how many rabbits there are:**
   - The number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats.
   - So, the number of rabbits is \( 180 - 12 = 168 \).

4. **Finally, we need to find out the total number of pets:**
   - We have 60 dogs, 120 cats, and 168 rabbits.
   - So, the total number of pets is \( 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \).

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many boys there are in Grade 5. We know that 2 out of every 5 students are boys. So, we can calculate the number of boys like this:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Now, we know there are 200 students in total, so the number of girls is:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the Girl Scouts. We know that 2 out of every 3 girls are in the Girl Scouts. So, we can calculate the number of girls in the Girl Scouts like this:

\[
\text{Number of girls in the Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls:

\[
\text{Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

So, the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is:

\[

"Harry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to do some simple math.

First, we find out how long James slept. We do this by multiplying 9 hours by 2/3:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James slept 6 hours. Now, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know that when Freda cooks the tomatoes, they lose half their volume. So, if she ends up with 32 ounces of sauce, she must have started with twice that amount of tomatoes. 
   - 32 ounces of sauce means she started with 32 * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

2. Each can of tomatoes has 16 ounces. To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total ounces of tomatoes by the ounces per can.
   - 64 ounces of tomatoes / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

3. Each can has 3 tomatoes. To find out how many tomatoes she used, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.
   - 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. Then, 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since we started with 30 cars, the equation is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"Mary has 40 window ledges, and she has 2 potted plants on each ledge. So, she has:

\[ 40 \text{ ledges} \times 2 \text{ plants/ledge} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

She got 18 more plants from the nursery, so now she has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 plant from each of the 40 ledges to her friends and family. So, she will give away:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} \]

After giving away the plants, she will have:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more times than the first friend. So, we need to find out what 1/4 of 20 is:
   \[
   20 \div 4 = 5
   \]
   Then we add that to 20:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 more times than the fourth friend. So, we add 10 to 60:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]
   So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell was pressed:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

First, we need to add up all the pages Solo has to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

So, the total number of pages is:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the number of pages he still needs to read is:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days.

"John drinks water 4 times every day from Monday to Friday. That's 4 glasses of water each day for 5 days. So, for the weekdays, he drinks:

4 glasses/day × 5 days = 20 glasses

On Saturday and Sunday, he drinks water 3 times each day. So, for the weekend, he drinks:

3 glasses/day × 2 days = 6 glasses

Now, to find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a whole week, we add the glasses from the weekdays and the weekend:

20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses

So, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week.

1. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
2. The city is 42 miles wide.

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile parts there are in 42 miles. We do this by dividing 42 by 3:
\[ 42 \div 3 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 parts of 3 miles each in 42 miles.

Next, we know that each 3-mile part takes 10 minutes to cover. So, to find out how long it takes to cover all 14 parts, we multiply 14 by 10:
\[ 14 \times 10 = 140 \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches tall. But the walls of the boxes are 1 inch thick. This means the inside of the box is smaller than the outside.

To find out how big the inside of one box is, we need to take away 1 inch from each side of the box. So, for each dimension:

- The inside length is 5 inches - 2 inches (1 inch from each side) = 3 inches.
- The inside width is 6 inches - 2 inches (1 inch from each side) = 4 inches.
- The inside height is 4 inches - 2 inches (1 inch from each side) = 2 inches.

Now, to find the volume of the inside of one box, we multiply these three numbers together:

- Inside volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we need to find the total volume for all 3 boxes:

- Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. Here's what he did each night:

- **Monday:** 1 hour
- **Tuesday:** 1 hour
- **Wednesday:** Some 30-minute shows
- **Thursday:** 1 hour and 30 minutes
- **Friday:** 2 hours

First, let's add up the time he watched TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add these times together:

1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:

7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each show on Wednesday was 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), we need to find out how many 30-minute shows make up 1.5 hours:

1.5 hours ÷ 0.5 hours per show = 3 shows

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

2. Next, we need to find out how much cashback we get. The app gives us $0.20 back for each gallon.
   - So, 10 gallons * $0.20 = $2.00

3. Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost to find out how much we actually pay.

\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]
So, Beatrice ate 48 fruit roll-ups.

Next, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. Marcell's roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, we multiply these numbers:

So, Marcell ate 42 fruit roll-ups.

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups that both of them ate to find the total:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]
So, together they ate 90 fruit roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people, which is 2:

First, we need to find out how much money Sasha spent on the lumber. She bought:
- 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $10.
- 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $16.

So, the total cost for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
10 boards × $10 = $100

And the total cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
5 boards × $16 = $80

Now, we add these two amounts to find the total cost:
$100 + $80 = $180

Next, we need to find out how much money Sasha will make if she sells the lumber. The prices have gone up by 50%, so:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
$10 + ($10 × 0.5) = $10 + $5 = $15

- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
$16 + ($16 × 0.5) = $16 + $8 = $24

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:
- Revenue from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards × $15 = $150

- Revenue from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards × $24 = $120

So, the total revenue is:
$150 + $120 = $270

1. If $40,000 is 130% of Lylah's salary, then 100% (which is Lylah's salary) can be found by dividing $40,000 by 1.30.
   \[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. So, we need to find out what 40% of $40,000 is and add it to $40,000.

2. 40% of $40,000 is:
   \[ 0.40 \times 40000 = 16000 \]
   So, Adrien's new salary is:
   \[ 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

Now, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% over the four years. We need to find out what 40% of $30,769.23 is and add it to $30,769.23.

3. 40% of $30,769.23 is:

   So, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[ 30769.23 + 12307.69 = 43076.92 \]

Finally, to find the total salary they were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary together.

4. Total salary:

To find out how many letters were already stamped when Jennie started, we need to subtract the 20 letters she just stamped from the 30 letters in the pile now:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 letters already stamped when Jennie began.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Julia bought a package of spoons. We don't know how many spoons were in it yet, so let's call that number \( x \).
2. Her husband bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew.
4. When she set the table, she had 12 spoons left.

Now, let's put this all together:

- Julia had \( x \) spoons from her package.
- Her husband added 5 more spoons, so now she had \( x + 5 \) spoons.
- She used 3 spoons to taste the stew, so she had \( x + 5 - 3 \) spoons left.
- We know that after all this, she had 12 spoons.

So, we can write this as:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. To find out how many sausages Dylan bought in all, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that Lily made 50 friends. That's a good start!

Now, the problem says that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. So, we need to add 20 to the number of friends Lily made to find out how many friends Amy made.

So, Amy made:
50 (Lily's friends) + 20 = 70 friends

Next, we need to find out how many friends they have together. We do this by adding the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:

50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120 friends

So, Lily and Amy have 120 friends together.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Cost of each pepper:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of each watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs.
   - So, a watermelon costs \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of each orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon.
   - So, an orange costs \( 45 - 5 = 40 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 4 watermelons:**
   - Each watermelon costs 45 dollars.
   - So, 4 watermelons cost \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 20 peppers:**
   - Each pepper costs 15 dollars.
   - So, 20 peppers cost \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.

6. **Total cost for 10 oranges:**
   - Each orange costs 40 dollars.
   - So, 10 oranges cost \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \) dollars.

7. **Total amount of money Dillon will spend:**
   - Add up the costs of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges.
   - Total amount = \( 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:

1. **How many people does the hospital see each day?**
   - The hospital sees 500 people each day.

2. **How long does each person stay at the hospital?**
   - Each person stays for 24 minutes.

3. **How many minutes do all the people stay in total?**
   - If 500 people each stay for 24 minutes, then the total time is:
     \[
     500 \text{ people} \times 24 \text{ minutes/person} = 12,000 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **How many hours is that?**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     12,000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **How much does the hospital charge the patients?**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour.
   - So, the total money the hospital gets from patients is:
     \[
     200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **How much does the hospital pay the doctors?**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour.
   - So, the total money the hospital pays to the doctors is:
     \[
     200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **How much profit does the hospital make?**
   - The profit is the total money the hospital gets minus the total money it pays to the doctors:
     \[
     40,000 \text{ dollars} - 30,000 \text{ dollars} = 10,000 \text{ dollars}

First, Nissa hires 60 elves. That's a lot of elves!

Then, a third of the elves quit because some kids got sick on them. To find out how many elves quit, we need to divide 60 by 3:
60 ÷ 3 = 20 elves quit.

So, now we have:
60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Next, 10 more elves quit because some kids kicked their shins. So, we need to subtract 10 from the 40 elves that were left:
40 - 10 = 30 elves.

So, the number of elves left is 30.

- Luge: 2 times
Total rides for Pam: 2 + 2 = 4 rides

Now, let's count how many rides Fred took:
- Roller coaster: 4 times
- Luge: 2 times
Total rides for Fred: 4 + 2 = 6 rides

Next, we add the total rides for both Pam and Fred:
Total rides for both: 4 + 6 = 10 rides

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so we multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride:
Total tickets used: 10 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets

So, Pam and Fred used 60 tickets that day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles on Tuesday.
3. From Monday to Wednesday, Walt walked a total of 41 miles.
4. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles.

So, let's do the math:
- Total miles from Monday to Wednesday: 41 miles
- Miles walked on Monday: 4 miles
- Miles walked on Tuesday: 24 miles
- Total miles from Monday to Tuesday: \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles

Now, subtract the total miles from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles:
- Miles walked on Wednesday: \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 unicorns are female. We know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we need to find two thirds of 9.

To find two thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3:

Next, let's find out how much the chips cost:
- Rory orders 2 bags of chips, and each bag costs $1.50.
- So, 2 bags * $1.50 = $3.00

Now, let's find out how much the cookies cost:
- Rory orders 2 cookies, and each cookie costs $1.00.
- So, 2 cookies * $1.00 = $2.00

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total before the delivery fee and tip:
- Subs: $15.00
- Chips: $3.00
- Cookies: $2.00
- Total so far: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the delivery fee:
- The delivery fee is 20% of the total so far.
- 20% of $20.00 is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total:
- Total so far: $20.00
- Delivery fee: $4.00
- New total: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip:

First, we need to figure out how many questions Mark finished in each test.

For the first test:
- Mark can do 5 questions in 1 hour.
- He had 8 hours to do the test.
- So, he did \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions.

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he didn't finish is:
- \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions.

For the second test:
- Mark can still do 5 questions in 1 hour.
- He had 6 hours to do this test.
- So, he did \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions.

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he didn't finish is:
- \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions.

Now, to find out how many questions he didn't finish in total, we add the questions he didn't finish from both tests:

- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
- There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use some simple numbers to help us understand:
- If we have 1 queen, then we have 2 baby bees (because there are twice as many baby bees as queens).
- If we have 2 baby bees, then we have 4 worker bees (because there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).

Now, let's add them up:
- 1 queen + 2 baby bees + 4 worker bees = 7 bees in total.

But we need to find out how many bees there are in a hive with 700 bees. We can use the same idea, but we need to make it bigger.

If 7 bees (1 queen + 2 baby bees + 4 worker bees) make up a small part of the hive, we can find out how many of these small parts fit into 700 bees:
- 700 bees ÷ 7 bees per part = 100 parts.

So, in each part:
- 1 queen × 100 parts = 100 queens.
- 2 baby bees × 100 parts = 200 baby bees.
- 4 worker bees × 100 parts = 400 worker bees.

Now, let's find out how many hours he spends in class over the whole semester. There are 16 weeks in the semester, so:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in school!

First, we need to figure out how long all the rolls are when put together. Bill bakes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long. 

To find the total length of the rolls:
- 300 rolls × 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

Next, we need to convert inches to feet because the final answer needs to be in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
- 1200 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 100 feet

Now, let's do the same for the chocolate croissants. Bill bakes 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.

To find the total length of the croissants:
- 120 croissants × 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

Convert inches to feet:
- 720 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 60 feet

Finally, for the baguettes. Bill bakes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long.

To find the total length of the baguettes:
- 60 baguettes × 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we add up all the lengths:
- Rolls: 100 feet
- Croissants: 60 feet
- Baguettes: 120 feet

Total length:
- 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many bananas all the apes eat in one month:
- The monkeys eat 200 bananas.
- The gorillas eat 400 bananas.
- The baboons eat 100 bananas.

So, if we add these up:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas} \]

This is how many bananas all the apes eat in one month.

Now, the zookeeper needs to order enough bananas to last for 2 months. So, we need to multiply the number of bananas they eat in one month by 2:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, let's see how far Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each time he runs back and forth, he covers 100 yards there and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards.
- So, Blake runs \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

Now, let's see how far Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- That's 100 yards there and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards.
- Then, Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- Each time she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 40 yards there and 40 yards back, which is 80 yards.
- So, Kelly runs \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards for this part.
- Adding the first part, Kelly runs \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards in total.

Now, let's find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2920 yards.
- The difference is \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

So, Blake runs 80 yards farther than Kelly.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Raphael spent on his school stuff.

First, we need to find out how much the pens cost. Raphael bought 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5. So, we do:
4 pens * $1.5 per pen = $6

Next, we need to find out how much the notebooks cost. Raphael bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4. So, we do:
2 notebooks * $4 per notebook = $8

Then, we have the cost of the rim of bond paper, which is $20.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

   \]
3. On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two-thirds of 24 feet, we multiply 24 by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

First, let's figure out how many fish Locsin caught:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:
- Total starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish.
- Total sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses.
- Total clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish.

Finally, let's add up all the fish:
- Total fish: 15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 fish.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **Start with the original price:**
   - The bag of marbles costs $20.

2. **Understand the increase:**
   - Every two months, the price goes up by 20% of the original price.
   - 20% of $20 is $4 (because 20% is the same as 20/100, and 20/100 * 20 = 4).

3. **Count how many times the price increases in 36 months:**
   - 36 months is the same as 18 two-month periods (because 36 / 2 = 18).

4. **Calculate the new price after each increase:**
   - After the first two months, the price is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - After the next two months, the price is $24 + $4 = $28.
   - We keep adding $4 for each two-month period.

5. **Find the total increase:**
   - Since the price increases by $4 every two months, and there are 18 two-month periods, the total increase is 18 * $4 = $72.

6. **Add the total increase to the original price:**
   - The final price is $20 + $72 = $92.

So, after 36 months, the bag of marbles would cost **$92**.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - So, the total cost for the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost 3 * $5 = $15.
   - So, the doll costs $15.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: $20
- Action figures: $15
- Doll: $15

Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

So, all the toys together are worth $50.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Jackie has two choices:
1. She can do her taxes herself, but then she won't be able to do 3 hours of her freelance work. She earns $35 for each hour of freelance work.
2. She can hire an accountant to do her taxes, and the accountant will charge her $90.

First, let's figure out how much money Jackie will lose if she does her taxes herself:
- She loses 3 hours of work.
- Each hour of work is worth $35.
- So, 3 hours * $35 = $105.

Now, let's see how much it costs to hire the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the two:
- If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105.
- If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.

So, the difference is:
- $105 - $90 = $15.

Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Elvira has €1500 to spend on a new computer and some other things. She picked a computer that costs €1090. She also chose a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. 

To find out how much money she will have left for clothes, we need to add up the cost of all the things she bought and then take that away from her total money.

First, let's add up the costs:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, we add these together:
1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423

So, the total cost of everything is €1423.

Next, we subtract this total from Elvira's budget:
1500 - 1423 = 77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is 1 year old, Seth would be 2 years old. If Brooke is 2 years old, Seth would be 4 years old, and so on. We can write this as:
   - Seth's age = 2 × Brooke's age

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means:
   - (Seth's age + 2) + (Brooke's age + 2) = 28

3. Let's simplify that:
   - Seth's age + 2 + Brooke's age + 2 = 28
   - Seth's age + Brooke's age + 4 = 28
   - Seth's age + Brooke's age = 24

4. Now, we know from step 1 that Seth's age is 2 times Brooke's age. So we can replace ""Seth's age"" with ""2 × Brooke's age"" in the equation:
   - 2 × Brooke's age + Brooke's age = 24
   - 3 × Brooke's age = 24

5. To find Brooke's age, we divide both sides by 3:
   - Brooke's age = 24 ÷ 3
   - Brooke's age = 8

6. Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age:
   - Seth's age = 2 × Brooke's age
   - Seth's age = 2 × 8
   - Seth's age = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Next, we need to figure out how many miles Pancho walks on the weekends. There are 2 weekend days, and Pancho walks 10 miles each day. So, we multiply 10 miles by 2 days:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from the weekdays and the weekends to find the total miles Pancho walks in a week:

Next, we count the legs of the insects:
- Jake sees 90 insects.
- Each insect has 6 legs.
- So, the total legs from insects are \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \) legs.

Finally, we count the legs of the rare mutant invertebrates:
- Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
- Each mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much Jessica has to pay each month for her debts. She has three different debts:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

To find the total minimum payment each month, we add these amounts together:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

So, the total minimum payment each month is $1000.

Next, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of $1000, we do:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]

Now, we add this 50% to the minimum payment:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica will pay $1500 each month.

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

     \[
     1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cutting the Potatoes:**
   - It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.
   - For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is:
     \[
     5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **First, we need to figure out how much money Juan and Carlos made in total.**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Profit is the money they made after paying for the lemons and sugar.
   - So, if we add the profit to the cost, we get the total money they made.

2. **Next, we need to find out how much it costs to make one gallon of lemonade.**
   - It costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar.
   - So, the total cost for one gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

3. **Now, let's figure out how much money they make from selling one gallon of lemonade.**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They get 20 glasses from one gallon.
   - So, the money they make from one gallon is 20 glasses × $0.50 = $10.

4. **We know the profit and the cost, so we can find out how many gallons they made.**
   - The profit is the total money they made minus the total cost.
   - We can write this as: Total money made = Profit + Total cost.
   - We know the profit is $25, and the total cost is $5 per gallon.
   - So, $10 per gallon × Number of gallons = $25 + $5 per gallon × Number of gallons.
   - Let's call the number of gallons ""G.""
   - This gives us: $10G = $25 + $5G.
   - To find G, we can subtract $5G from both sides: $10G - $5G = $25.
   - This simplifies to: $5G = $25.
   - So, G = $25 ÷ $5 = 5 gallons.

5. **Finally, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons.**
   - They made 5 gallons.
   - It costs $3 for lemons per gallon.
   - So, the total cost for lemons is 5 gallons × $3 = $15.

So, the amount they spent on lemons is:

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}

4. **Donation to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

- So, the total time for Team 2 is \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

Now, we need to find out how many seconds Team 1 wins by. We subtract the total time of Team 1 from the total time of Team 2:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \]

So, Team 1 wins by 2 seconds.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

### Step 1: Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 numbers that are greater than 3.

The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
This means there's a 50% chance of rolling a number greater than 3.

### Step 2: Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers.

The chance of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
This means there's a 50% chance of rolling an even number on one roll.

Since we need to roll two even numbers in a row, we multiply the chances:
\[
0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]
This means there's a 25% chance of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 3: Comparing the Chances
Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

We know:
- The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%.
- The chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.

To find out how much more likely it is, we divide the first chance by the second chance:
\[
\frac{50\%}{25\%} = 2
\]
This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

So, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that:
- There are 3 cages of rats.
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There's a pen of rabbits that gets 20 pieces of straw.
- In total, 160 pieces of straw are used.

Now, let's figure out how many pieces of straw the hamsters and rabbits use:
- Hamsters: 10 cages × 5 pieces = 50 pieces
- Rabbits: 20 pieces

So, the hamsters and rabbits together use:
50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces

This means the rats must use the rest of the straw:
160 pieces (total) - 70 pieces (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces

Now, we know that the rats use 90 pieces of straw in total. Since each rat gets 6 pieces, we can find out how many rats there are:
90 pieces ÷ 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats

Since the rats are in 3 cages, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:
15 rats ÷ 3 cages = 5 rats per cage

So, the number of rats in each cage is:
5

The answer is:

"Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to add 2% more money each month if Mandy doesn't pay. Mandy pays after 3 months. Let's figure out how much more she needs to pay.

First, we need to find out how much 2% of $100 is:
2% of $100 = 2/100 * 100 = $2

So, each month, Mandy owes $2 more.

After 1 month, Mandy owes:
$100 + $2 = $102

After 2 months, Mandy owes:
$102 + $2 = $104

After 3 months, Mandy owes:
$104 + $2 = $106

So, Mandy should give Benedict:

1. The trader buys each bag of wheat for $20.
2. It costs $2 to move each bag from the farm to the warehouse.
3. So, the total cost for each bag is $20 + $2 = $22.
4. The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. The profit for each bag is $30 - $22 = $8.
6. The trader made a total profit of $400.
7. To find out how many bags the trader sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $400 ÷ $8 = 50.

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that three friends spent $20.25 on tickets to the fair. That's the cost of the tickets.

Next, they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, we need to subtract $4.50 from $20.25 to find out how much they spent on food:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]
So, they spent $15.75 on food.

Then, they went on two different rides, and each ride cost $33. So, we need to multiply $33 by 2 to find out the total cost of the rides:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]
So, they spent $66 on the rides.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]
So, the total cost for everything is $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 102 \div 3 = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ 34 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that one duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week to stay healthy. If there are 10 ducks, we need to find out how much all the ducks need together in one week.

So, we multiply 3.5 pounds by 10 ducks:
3.5 pounds/duck × 10 ducks = 35 pounds

This means the 10 ducks need 35 pounds of insects in one week.

Now, we need to find out how much they need each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly amount by 7:
35 pounds ÷ 7 days = 5 pounds/day

So, the 10 ducks need 5 pounds of insects each day.

2. **Trees Planted and Chopped Each Year**: Every year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, each year, the number of trees increases by:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees}
   \]
3. **Number of Trees After 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the starting number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees That Die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final Number of Trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:

   - On Friday morning, Sue had 18 pink plastic flamingos in her yard.

2. **Then, on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took away one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is 6 (because \( 18 \div 3 = 6 \)).
   - They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back in the yard.

3. **So, after Saturday morning:**

   - White flamingos added: 6.

4. **On Sunday morning:**
   - The neighbors added 18 more pink plastic flamingos to the yard.

5. **Now, let's count the total number of pink and white flamingos:**

3. **Second Month**: She collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. So, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. **Third Month**: She collected twice the total number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The total from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). So, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards she has:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Jerry has some red chickens and some white chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs each day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Also, Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many red chickens Jerry has.

1. Let's say the number of red chickens is \( R \).
2. Since Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( R + 2 \).

Now, let's write an equation for the total number of eggs:

- Each red chicken lays 3 eggs, so \( R \) red chickens lay \( 3R \) eggs.
- Each white chicken lays 5 eggs, so \( R + 2 \) white chickens lay \( 5(R + 2) \) eggs.

The total number of eggs collected each day is 42, so we can write:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, expand the equation:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]

2. Combine like terms:
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

3. Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8R = 32 \]

4. Divide both sides by 8:
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

First, we need to find out how far Gary walks. The park is a rectangle, and we know the length and the width. To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to add up all the sides of the rectangle. 

The park is 6 miles long and 1.5 miles wide. So, we have:
- Two long sides that are each 6 miles.
- Two short sides that are each 1.5 miles.

Now, let's add them up:
- The two long sides: 6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles
- The two short sides: 1.5 miles + 1.5 miles = 3 miles

So, the total distance Gary walks is:
12 miles + 3 miles = 15 miles

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes Gary to walk 15 miles. We know that Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. This means he can walk 3 miles in 1 hour.

To find out how many hours it takes to walk 15 miles, we divide the total distance by his speed:
15 miles ÷ 3 miles per hour = 5 hours

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

Now, we need to find out how many customers came on the third day. We can do this by adding up the customers from the first two days and then subtracting that from the total.

First, let's add the customers from the first two days:
100 (first day) + 150 (second day) = 250 customers

Next, we subtract this from the total number of customers:
500 (total) - 250 (first two days) = 250 customers

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Imagine we have two pools, a big one and a small one. Both pools have a tiny hole that lets 4 gallons of water out every minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's call the amount of water in the small pool right now ""S"" gallons. The big pool has ""B"" gallons right now.

1. **Four minutes ago:**
   - The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (because 4 gallons leaked out each minute for 4 minutes).
   - The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons (for the same reason).

2. **Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:**
   - So, \( B + 16 = 2 \times (S + 16) \).

3. **Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:**
   - So, \( B = 4 \times S \).

Now, let's use these two pieces of information to find out how much water is in the small pool right now.

First, we know:
\[ B = 4S \]

Next, we use the information from four minutes ago:
\[ B + 16 = 2 \times (S + 16) \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2 \times (S + 16) \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water right now.

"Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes that costs $320.00 and a belt that costs $32.00. First, we need to find out how much money she needs in total. We add the cost of the shoes and the belt:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, Lori needs $352.00 in total.

Lori earns $8.00 for each hour she works. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 ÷ 8.00 = 44 \]

Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, Janeth borrowed $2000. She promised to pay back an extra 10% of that amount. 

To find 10% of $2000, we do:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the extra amount she needs to pay is $200.

Now, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 each month for 12 months. To find out how much she will pay in total, we do:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she still owes after paying $1980. We subtract the amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay back:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, we know there are 4 roses in the vase. The problem says there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, if we have 4 roses, we add 7 more to find out how many dahlias there are:

4 roses + 7 = 11 dahlias

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias together:

4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet. So, Adrian is:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. So, Zack is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, let's figure out how old they will be in three years:
1. Harriet will be:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

1. First, we know that Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. So, half of 68 is 34, and 10 more than 34 is 44. So, Yuri scored 44 points.
3. Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, 17 more than 68 is 85. So, Brianna scored 85 points.
4. Now, we add up the points that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.
5. The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total: 251 - 197 = 54.

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how long Carmen spent on the crossword puzzles:
- It takes her 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She did 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, 10 minutes times 3 puzzles equals 30 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long she spent on the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes her 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She did 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, 5 minutes times 8 puzzles equals 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time she spent on both types of puzzles:
- 30 minutes for crossword puzzles plus 40 minutes for sudoku puzzles equals 70 minutes.

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we start with 120 liters of water in the tank. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden. So, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after she used some.

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

So, 30 liters of water are left in the tank.

Next, Celine collected rainwater. She collected twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, we need to find out how much rainwater she collected.

2 × 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater she collected to the water that was already in the tank.

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the tank now has 90 liters of water.

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. That's a lot of flowers!

Next, it says he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, we need to take the number of geraniums and subtract 40 to find out how many petunias he plants.

90 - 40 = 50

So, Andy plants 50 petunias.

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and the number of petunias together:

90 + 50 = 140

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.

1. First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.
2. Next, we need to figure out how long it takes to travel by car. The problem says it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. So, if it takes 6 days by bus, it will take 6 divided by 2, which is 3 days by car.
3. Now, we need to add the time it takes to go to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to come back by car. So, 6 days (by bus) + 3 days (by car) = 9 days.

So, Andrew will travel for 9 days in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many Pokemon cards James has at the start:
- Fire type: 30 cards
- Grass type: 20 cards
- Water type: 40 cards

So, the total number of cards at the start is:
30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards

Now, some changes happen:
- James loses 8 water type cards, so he has:
40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 more grass type cards, so he has:
20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's find out the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30 cards
- Grass type: 34 cards
- Water type: 32 cards

So, the new total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, let's do the math:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the percentage is:
33%

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33%.

- The base burrito costs $6.50.
- Extra meat costs $2.00.
- Extra cheese costs $1.00.
- Avocado costs $1.00.
- Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so that's $0.25 + $0.25 = $0.50.
- The meal upgrade with chips and a drink costs $3.00.

Now, let's add all these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

So, the total cost is $14.00.

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00. We need to subtract this from the total cost:

So, 36 watermelons were ready and Ashlyn took them home. Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Two weeks later, Ashlyn went back to the farm. This time, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready. To find out how many that is, we do:

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax is 10% of the total cost of the cars.
   - 10% of 240,000 is \( 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \) dollars.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - For 12 cars, the total registration fee is \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Now, we add up all the costs:

First, we have two aquariums. One has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. We need to find out how many more snails are in the bigger aquarium compared to the smaller one. 

To do this, we subtract the number of snails in the smaller aquarium from the number of snails in the bigger aquarium:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

So, there are 28 more snails in the bigger aquarium.

Next, the problem says that this difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. This means if we add up all the fish in both aquariums, the number we get should be half of 28.

Let's find half of 28:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 fish in total in both aquariums.

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we need to divide the total number of fish by 2 to find out how many fish are in each aquarium:

1. First, we need to find out how much the makeup artist charges for one day. The makeup artist charges $250 for each hour, and it takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
   - So, for one day, the cost is: \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

2. Next, we need to find out how much it costs for one week. She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
   - So, for one week, the cost is: \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

3. Now, we need to find out how much it costs for the whole movie. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
   - So, for the whole movie, the cost is: \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

4. After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of all the work done. To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of 30000.
   - The discount is: \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.

5. Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid.
   - So, Jean paid: \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

Jean paid:
27000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to add up all the money Isabelle spent on the party stuff:
- She spent $12 on cake ingredients.
- She spent $43 on birthday presents.
- She spent $15 on decorations.
- She spent $4 on invitations.
- She spent $22 on goodie bags.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96

So, the total cost of the party supplies is $96.

Next, we need to split this cost three ways, because Isabelle and her two parents are sharing the cost. To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by 3:
96 ÷ 3 = 32

So, each person pays $32.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, we multiply:
   4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

2. Next, we need to find out how much the onions cost. Each pound of onions costs $1.50. So, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound:
   200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

So, the chef spent $300.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's add up the total cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies:**
- Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies
- Her sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Next, we need to find out how many calories each of them ate. Each cookie has 200 calories.

**Total calories:**
- Sue: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
- Her sister: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, we need to find out how many more calories Sue ate compared to her sister.

**Difference in calories:**
- \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue ate 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we need to know how many students are in the whole school. Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes. So, we do:
   \[
   20 \text{ students/class} \times 3 \text{ classes} = 60 \text{ students}
   \]

2. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls. That means half of the students are boys and half are girls. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ students}}{2} = 30 \text{ boys} \quad \text{and} \quad 30 \text{ girls}
   \]

3. Now, let's look at the girls in each class:
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - We need to find out how many girls are in the third class. We know there are 30 girls in total, so:
   \[
   30 \text{ girls} - 15 \text{ girls (first class)} - 12 \text{ girls (second class)} = 3 \text{ girls (third class)}
   \]

4. Since each class has 20 students, and the third class has 3 girls, the rest must be boys. So, we do:
   \[
   20 \text{ students (third class)} - 3 \text{ girls (third class)} = 17 \text{ boys (third class)}
   \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **Last Night:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today:**
   - Rick killed 3 fewer cougars than last night. So, he killed:
     \[
     15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars}
     \]
   - Rick killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars today. So, he killed:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves}
     \]

3. **Total Animals Killed Today:**
   - Wolves: 36
   - Cougars: 12
   - Total today:
     \[
     36 + 12 = 48 \text{ animals}
     \]

4. **Total Animals Killed Over Both Nights:**
   - Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
   - Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals
   - Total:
     \[
     25 + 48 = 73 \text{ animals}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Bill starts on the 3rd floor. The problem says he goes up to a floor that is 4 times his starting floor plus 6. 

First, we need to find out what 4 times his starting floor is:
4 times 3 is 12.

Next, we add 6 to that number:
12 plus 6 is 18.

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. 

Next, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times that is, we need to calculate 30% of 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \] times.

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

84"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know there are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows. So, we can find out how many cows there are in total by multiplying:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. He wants to put these new cows into 20 stalls, so we need to figure out how many new cows go into each stall. We do this by dividing:
\[ 40 \text{ new cows} \div 20 \text{ stalls} = 2 \text{ new cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall originally had 20 cows, and now it has 2 more cows. So, each stall now has:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ new cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We do this by multiplying the number of cows in one stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 176 \]"
"Okay, let's count the money in Brady's piggy bank step by step!

1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, he has $1.00.
2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 40 nickels are 40 * 5 = 200 cents. Since 100 cents make 1 dollar, 200 cents is $2.00.
3. **Dimes**: Brady has 20 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 20 dimes are 20 * 10 = 200 cents. Again, 200 cents is $2.00.
4. **Dollar bills**: Brady has 40 dollar bills. Each dollar bill is worth $1.00, so 40 dollar bills are 40 * $1.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- $1.00 (pennies)
- $2.00 (nickels)
- $2.00 (dimes)
- $40.00 (dollar bills)

$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot tree. We do this by dividing 200 by 10:
   \[
   200 \div 10 = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. So, to find the total weight of the tree, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:
   \[
   20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. The termites ate 30% of the tree. To find out how much weight that is, we need to calculate 30% of 8000 pounds. We do this by multiplying 8000 by 0.30:
   \[
   8000 \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight:
   \[
   8000 - 2400 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is:

She also has to pay a flat fee of 2 dollars because one of her books was more than a week late.

So, the total amount she has to pay is:

4 dollars + 2 dollars = 6 dollars

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're doing a fun math puzzle!

1. First, we know that Andrea has 52 apples.
2. The problem says Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal must have:
   \[
   52 - 8 = 44 \text{ apples}
   \]
3. Next, the problem tells us that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, if Jamal has 44 apples, he must have:
   \[
   44 + 4 = 48 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. The problem also says that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, if Jamal has 48 bananas, Andrea must have:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ bananas}

5. Now, let's add up all the fruits:
   - Andrea's apples: 52
   - Andrea's bananas: 24
   - Jamal's apples: 44
   - Jamal's bananas: 48

The total number of fruits is 168."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many cookies Carla is making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, we add those together:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies. We know that 2 cups of flour make 12 cookies. So, we need to figure out how many sets of 12 cookies are in 66 cookies:
\[ 66 \div 12 = 5.5 \]

This means there are 5.5 sets of 12 cookies in 66 cookies. Since each set of 12 cookies needs 2 cups of flour, we multiply 5.5 by 2:
\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake all the cookies.

   9,300 \div 3 = 3,100
   \]
   \[
   3,100 \times 2 = 6,200

So, two-thirds of the pennies is 6,200 pennies.

2. Now, we need to convert these pennies into dollars. We know that 100 pennies make 1 dollar:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **Find the brokerage fee:**
   - The house costs $350,000.
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the house price.
   - To find 5% of $350,000, we multiply 350,000 by 0.05.
   - \( 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \)
   - So, the brokerage fee is $17,500.

2. **Find the transfer fee:**
   - The transfer fee is 12% of the house price.
   - To find 12% of $350,000, we multiply 350,000 by 0.12.
   - \( 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \)
   - So, the transfer fee is $42,000.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the house price plus the brokerage fee plus the transfer fee.
   - \( 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \)
   - So, the total cost is $409,500.

4. **Find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   - Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000.
   - To find out how much more the total cost is, we subtract the budget from the total cost.
   - \( 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \)
   - So, the total cost is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees and also pay off the rest of his loan. Let's figure out how much money he has left after all that.

1. **Selling Price:**
   - The house was sold for $400,000.

2. **Transfer Fees:**
   - He had to pay 3% of the selling price for transfer fees.
   - 3% of $400,000 is \( 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \).

3. **Brokerage Fee:**
   - He also had to pay 5% of the selling price for the brokerage fee.
   - 5% of $400,000 is \( 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \).

4. **Remaining Loan:**
   - He still had to pay $250,000 to clear the loan on the house.

5. **Total Expenses:**
   - The total amount he had to pay is the sum of the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan.
   - Total expenses = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

6. **Net Proceeds:**
   - To find out how much money Mr. Tan has left, we subtract the total expenses from the selling price.
   - Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 20 \times 0.40 = 8 \) minutes.
   - So, it takes \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.

3. **Total time to heat the oil:**
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 28 = 48 \) minutes.

4. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil.

Next, we need to find out how much the agent spent on the television ads:
- Each television ad costs $75.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.
- So, the total cost for the television ads is 15 ads * $75 per ad = $1125.

Now, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to get the total amount spent:
- Total cost = $250 (newspaper ads) + $1125 (television ads) = $1375.

So, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads.

2. Next, we add the extra windows in one house.
   - Each house has 4 extra windows.
   - So, the total number of windows in one house is \(6 + 4 = 10\).

3. Since John has 2 houses, we need to double the number of windows in one house.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches. So, the collar takes \( 900 \div 10 = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project. So, the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2:
\[ 630 \div 2 = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is 80 packets × $30 per packet = $2400.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total money she spent:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400

1. **Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice as many lines as the song.
   - So, \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) lines in the first scene.
   - But only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \( 108 \div 3 = 36 \) lines are Sean's in the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has 6 more lines than the song.
   - So, \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines in the second scene.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \( 60 \times \frac{4}{5} = 48 \) lines are Sean's in the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're doing a fun math puzzle!

First, Carly has 80 cards. We need to find out how many of these cards have the letter D on them.

1. **Cards with A:**
   - 2 out of every 5 cards have the letter A.
   - So, we calculate: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \) cards have the letter A.

2. **Remaining cards after A:**
   - We subtract the A cards from the total: \( 80 - 32 = 48 \) cards are left.

3. **Cards with B:**
   - Half of the remaining cards have the letter B.
   - So, we calculate: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \) cards have the letter B.

4. **Remaining cards after B:**
   - We subtract the B cards from the remaining cards: \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) cards are left.

5. **Cards with C:**
   - 5 out of every 8 of the remaining cards have the letter C.
   - So, we calculate: \( \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \) cards have the letter C.

6. **Remaining cards after C:**
   - We subtract the C cards from the remaining cards: \( 24 - 15 = 9 \) cards are left.

So, the number of cards with the letter D on them is 9.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how long it takes Matthew to dig all the small holes:
- It takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.
- So, 3 minutes per hole times 30 holes is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes him to dig all the large holes:
- It takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.
- So, 10 minutes per hole times 15 holes is 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes together:
- 90 minutes for small holes + 150 minutes for large holes = 240 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, 240 minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour is 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig all the holes.

"Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 right now. In 10 years, both of them will be 10 years older. So, we need to add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco to their current total age.

20 + 10 + 10 = 40

So, in 10 years, the sum of their ages will be 40."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. This means if Sam is 1 year old, Ruby would be 6 years old. If Sam is 2 years old, Ruby would be 12 years old, and so on. So, we can write this as:
   \[
   \text{Ruby's age} = 6 \times \text{Sam's age}
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This means if we add 9 years to both their ages, Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age. We can write this as:
   \[
   \text{Ruby's age} + 9 = 3 \times (\text{Sam's age} + 9)
   \]

3. Let's use \( S \) for Sam's age and \( R \) for Ruby's age. From the first piece of information, we know:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

4. Now, let's use the second piece of information:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

5. Substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

6. Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   \]

7. Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
   \[
   3S + 9 = 27
   \]

8. Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   3S = 18
   \]

9. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   S = 6
   \]

So, Sam is 6 years old right now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much Peter paid for the popsicles. He bought 20 popsicles, and each one costs 25 cents. So, we multiply 20 by 25 cents:
20 popsicles * 25 cents = 500 cents

Next, we need to find out how much he paid for the ice cream bars. He bought 4 ice cream bars, and each one costs 50 cents. So, we multiply 4 by 50 cents:
4 ice cream bars * 50 cents = 200 cents

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together:
500 cents + 200 cents = 700 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 700 cents to dollars:
700 cents / 100 = 7 dollars

So, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots. The problem says that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, if we divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2, we can find out how many spots a mamba has:
\[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \]
So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Next, we need to find out how many spots all the cobras have together. There are 40 cobras, and each has 70 spots:
\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
So, all the cobras together have 2800 spots.

Now, let's find out how many spots all the mambas have together. There are 60 mambas, and each has 35 spots:
\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]
So, all the mambas together have 2100 spots.

To find the total number of spots for all the snakes, we add the spots from the cobras and the mambas:
\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]
So, all the snakes together have 4900 spots.

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:
\[ 4900 \div 2 = 2450 \]

So, half the number of spots they all have combined is:
2450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many people are coming to the soccer game. There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the number of guests is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Next, we add the 3 coaches to the total number of people:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pizzas we need. Each pizza can serve 3 people. So, the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

So, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."

1. **First, we need to know how much space the topaz gemstones take up:**
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones.
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

2. **Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The whole necklace is 25 inches long.
   - The topaz gemstones take up 8 inches.
   - So, the space left for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

3. **Now, we need to figure out how many sterling silver beads fit into the 17 inches:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
   - To find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 0.25 (which is the same as 1/4).
   - \( 17 \div 0.25 = 68 \).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

In the second week, they each wrote double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each person:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up all the stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot:
- Total stories: \(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\)

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much money Kelly has. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
  5 * 25 = 125 cents

- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
  2 * 10 = 20 cents

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find out the total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know the flag has 76 stars in total. We also know there are three rows with 8 stars each and two rows with 6 stars each.

Let's add up the stars in the rows we know:
- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add these together:
\[24 + 12 = 36\] stars

So, we have 36 stars accounted for. The flag has 76 stars in total, so we need to find out how many stars are left:
\[76 - 36 = 40\] stars

These 40 stars are in rows that each have 5 stars. To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide 40 by 5:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

\[ 75 \text{ pounds} \times 80 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many trucks are needed to carry all 6000 pounds. Each truck can carry 2000 pounds. So, we divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ 6000 \text{ pounds} \div 2000 \text{ pounds/truck} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

So, we need 3 trucks to transport all 80 flagstones.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for the car in the slow lane to go 480 miles. We can use a simple formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

The distance is 480 miles, and the speed is 30 miles per hour. So we do the math:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover 480 miles.

   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali.
   - So, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. **Next, we add the medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. **Now, we need to figure out how many medals have been given out in total:**
   - Ali and Izzy together have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out.
   - This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

That means there are 40 chocolate bars in total.

Next, we need to see how many chocolate bars the adults get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, we do:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]
That means the adults get 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]
So, there are 16 chocolate bars left for the children.

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. So, we do:

First, we need to figure out how much rice each person eats in one meal. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.

Next, we need to find out how much rice the whole family eats in one meal. There are 5 people in the family, so:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \]

Now, we need to know how much rice the family eats in one day. They eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), so:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Then, we need to find out how much rice the family eats in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, the bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of these loaves. To find out how many loaves that is, we can do this:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[ \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Now, half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of 20:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

These 10 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and the evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. First, we need to figure out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. So, we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:
   \[
   8 \div 4 = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Now, we know that Joey loses 2 pounds in one week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same 2 pounds that Joey loses in one week.

3. We want to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds, we need to figure out how many 2-pound losses are in 8 pounds:
   \[
   8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ (2-pound losses)}
   \]

4. Since each 2-pound loss takes Sandy 4 weeks, we multiply the number of 2-pound losses by 4 weeks:
   \[
   4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

1. **Ice Cream Savings:**
   - One tub of ice cream used to cost $13, but now it costs $11.
   - So, you save $13 - $11 = $2 on each tub.
   - If you buy 2 tubs, you save 2 * $2 = $4.

2. **Milk Savings:**
   - Each packet of milk is now $0.5 cheaper.
   - If you buy 4 packets, you save 4 * $0.5 = $2.

3. **Total Savings:**
   - From the ice cream, you save $4.
   - From the milk, you save $2.
   - So, the total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

You will save $6 in total.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school!

Helena's special potion makes people grow extra arms and legs. Here's how it works:

- Every 3 days, a person gets a new arm.
- Every 5 days, a person gets a new leg.

We need to find out how many new arms and legs a person will have after 15 days.

First, let's count the new arms:
- After 3 days: 1 new arm
- After 6 days: 2 new arms
- After 9 days: 3 new arms
- After 12 days: 4 new arms
- After 15 days: 5 new arms

So, in 15 days, a person gets 5 new arms.

Now, let's count the new legs:
- After 5 days: 1 new leg
- After 10 days: 2 new legs
- After 15 days: 3 new legs

So, in 15 days, a person gets 3 new legs.

Now, let's add the new arms and new legs together:
- New arms: 5
- New legs: 3
- Total new limbs: 5 + 3 = 8

So, after 15 days, a person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much Theo spent on the business suits. He bought 6 suits, and each suit costs $100. So, we do:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the suitcases. He bought 3 suitcases, and each suitcase costs $50. So, we do:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, let's figure out how much the flight ticket costs. The ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of one business suit. One suit costs $100, so 5 times that is:
5 * $100 = $500
Then, we add $700 to that:
$500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the money Theo has spent so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for his trip. So, out of his $6000, he plans to spend:
$6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, we need to find out how much money he has left to spend on gifts. We subtract the total amount he has already spent from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

First, we need to know how many eggs the family eats each day. There are 5 people in the family. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day.

1. **Eggs eaten by the three people:**
   - Each of these three people eats 3 eggs.
   - So, \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\).

2. **Eggs eaten by the two people:**
   - Each of these two people eats 2 eggs.
   - So, \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\).

3. **Total eggs eaten each day:**
   - Add the eggs eaten by the three people and the two people.
   - \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\).

Now, we need to find out how many eggs the family eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

4. **Total eggs eaten in a week:**
   - Multiply the daily total by 7.
   - \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}\).

So, the family will eat 91 eggs in a week.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
   - Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Noah is 20 + 6 = 26 years old now.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah was 20 years old, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population was half of what it is now.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class.

We have a football team with 105 players. We need to figure out how many players are on the defense.

1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense.
2. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense.

Let's use a simple letter to help us. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) (because it's twice the defense).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \) (because it's half the defense).

Now, we add all these players together to get the total number of players on the team:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's add these up:
\[ D + 2D = 3D \]
So, we have:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply everything by 2:
\[ 2 \times 3D + 2 \times \frac{D}{2} = 2 \times 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 7 to find \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each. So, \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of people invited:
- \(12 + 12 = 24\) people.

Next, we need to figure out how many people couldn't come:
- 8 people couldn't come because they were sick.
- 1/4 of the number of sick people had other plans. So, \(1/4 \times 8 = 2\) people.

Now, let's add the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and those with other plans:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) people couldn't come.

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
- \(24 - 10 = 14\) people.

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:

So, the volume is:
6 feet × 4 feet × 5 feet = 120 cubic feet

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to fill the pool. We know it costs $0.1 for each cubic foot of water.

To do this, we can set up a simple equation. If 1 pole needs 3 wires, then the number of poles (let's call it \( P \)) times 3 should equal 45 wires.

So, we write it like this:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 15 \]

2. **Next, we figure out how many people left after an hour:**
   - One-fourth of the total number of people left.
   - One-fourth of 40 is 40 ÷ 4 = 10 people.

   - If 10 people left, then 40 - 10 = 30 people are still at the party.

4. **We know that 22 men stayed at the party:**
   - So, the rest of the people who stayed must be women.

If we take away the 2 extra pencils, we have:
26 - 2 = 24 pencils left in the boxes.

Since there are 3 boxes, we can divide the 24 pencils by 3 to find out how many pencils are in each box:
24 ÷ 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, let's see how many pencils Jam and her sister Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. So, we add them up:
26 + 46 = 72 pencils in total.

Each box can hold 8 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

Shannon makes her iced coffee by adding ice cubes and cream. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. She also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also makes the coffee weaker.

First, we need to find out how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees:
- If each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, then to cool it by 65 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:
  \[
  65 \div 13 = 5 \text{ ice cubes}

Next, we need to figure out how much weaker the coffee gets from the ice cubes:
- Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it:
  \[
  5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
  \]

Now, we add the 15 milliliters of cream, which also makes the coffee weaker:
- So, the total amount the coffee gets weaker is:

   - \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \)
   - There are 40 junior programmers.

2. **Find out how many senior programmers there are:**
   - If there are 100 people in total and 40 are junior programmers, then the rest must be senior programmers.

   - There are 60 senior programmers.

3. **Find out how much each type of programmer gets paid:**
   - Junior programmers get $2000 each month.
   - Senior programmers get $400 more than junior programmers.
   - So, senior programmers get \( 2000 + 400 = 2400 \) each month.

4. **Calculate the total pay for all junior programmers:**
   - There are 40 junior programmers, and each gets $2000.

- So, he makes \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars a year.
- But he has to pay 20% of that in taxes.
- 20% of 30,000 is \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars.
- So, after taxes, he has \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars left.

**Job B:**
- Nick gets $42,000 a year.
- He has to pay $6,000 in property tax.
- So, after property tax, he has \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars left.
- He also has to pay 10% of that in taxes.
- 10% of 36,000 is \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars.

Jason has 1 gun.
Richard has 5 guns.

Now, let's add them all up:
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns in total.

There are 4 people, so we need to share these 24 guns equally among them. To find out how many guns each person gets, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So, each person would have 6 guns.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much sugar Mason needs for the suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
- He wants to make 8 batches of suckers.
- So, for 8 batches, he needs \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces of sugar.

Next, we need to find out how much sugar Mason needs for the fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
- He wants to make 1 batch of fudge.
- So, for 1 batch, he needs \( 70 \times 1 = 70 \) ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge)
- Total sugar needed = 310 ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total.

"Maria bought 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. So, she spent:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

In the first year, the stock price went up by 50%. That means each share is now worth:
\[ 8 + (8 \times 0.50) = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the value of all her shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

In the second year, the stock price went down by 25%. That means each share is now worth:
\[ 12 - (12 \times 0.25) = 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the value of all her shares after the second year is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

We have 200 students in total, and they are split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups ""x."" So, the smallest group has ""x - 10"" students.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of students:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we add 10 to both sides to get rid of the -10:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to find x:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than 70:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
60"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and all of them are either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens as cows. We need to find out how many legs all the animals have together.

1. First, let's figure out how many cows and chickens there are.
   - Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
   - Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

2. We know the total number of animals is 60, so:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
   \[
   C = 20
   \]

3. So, there are 20 cows. Since there are twice as many chickens:
   \[
   2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]
   So, there are 40 chickens.

4. Now, let's count the legs:
   - Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have:
     \[
     20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ legs}
     \]
   - Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ legs}
     \]

5. Adding the legs together:
   \[
   80 + 80 = 160
   \]

So, the total number of legs all the animals have together is 160.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

Now, let's figure out how much each juice box costs:
- Juice Box B: 4 dollars (for A) + 5 dollars = 9 dollars.
- Juice Box C: 4 dollars (for A) + 7 dollars = 11 dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B:
- 11 dollars (for C) - 9 dollars (for B) = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **Total cookies in the bag**: Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag has 36 cookies.
2. **Cookies for her son**: Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week. So, 4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies.
3. **Cookies for her husband**: Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. So, 1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies.

Now, let's add up the cookies eaten by her son and her husband:
20 cookies (son) + 7 cookies (husband) = 27 cookies

Finally, we subtract the total cookies eaten by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. First, we need to find out how much the shirts cost without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
   - So, $30 + $30 = $60

2. Next, we need to figure out how much the discount is. The discount is 40% off.
   - To find 40% of $60, we can think of it as 40 out of 100 parts of $60.
   - 40% of $60 is the same as 0.40 times $60.
   - 0.40 * $60 = $24

3. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Davos paid.
   - $60 - $24 = $36

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much money the factory used to make each day when they made tractors. They sold 10 tractors a day, and each tractor was worth $100. So, we multiply:

10 tractors/day × $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, let's see how much money they make each day with the silos. They sell 5 silos a day, and each silo is worth $220. So, we multiply again:

5 silos/day × $220/silo = $1100/day

Next, we need to find out how much more money they make now compared to before. We subtract the old amount from the new amount:

$1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

To find out what percentage more they are making, we divide the extra money by the old amount and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

($100/day ÷ $1000/day) × 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more money each day now.

- Treats cost $20 a month.
- Medicine costs $100 a month.

Now, let's add these up to find the total monthly cost:
- Total monthly cost = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

Next, we need to find out how much she spends in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
- Total annual cost = $220 x 12 = $2640.

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog each year.

- **Wednesday**: Cheese-tasting event for half an hour, which is 0.5 hours.
- **Thursday**: Museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class, so that's 1.5 hours.
- **Friday**: Two hours of errands.

Now, let's add all these times together:
1 hour (Monday) + 3 hours (Tuesday) + 0.5 hours (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 8 hours

First, we need to figure out how many plant pots the school needs for the roses. They asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. So, we do:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \]
That means they need 60 plant pots for the roses.

Next, we add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses together:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]
So, the school needs 90 plant pots in total.

April already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots the school needs from the number she bought:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know John spent 6 hours boating. He also spent half that time swimming, so that's 3 hours. He watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long, so that's 6 hours.

Now, let's add all these times together:
- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 3 hours
- Watching shows: 6 hours

So, 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

The problem says that these 15 hours are 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can think of it like this: if 15 hours is 30%, then 100% (the total time) would be how many hours?

We can set it up like this:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} = 30\% \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 100\% \]

To find the total time, we can use a simple trick:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{30\%} \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. So, we need to find 40% of 50 hours:
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 40\% \times 50 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

"Morgan's dad said she has $90 for her birthday party. She wants to play mini-golf, have arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Let's figure out how many friends she can invite.

First, let's see how much it costs for one person:
- Mini-golf costs $5.
- Arcade tokens cost $5.
- Go-karts cost $10 each time, and she wants to ride twice, so that's $10 x 2 = $20.

So, for one person, the total cost is:
$5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30

Now, Morgan has $90 to spend. If one person costs $30, we can find out how many people can go by dividing $90 by $30:
$90 ÷ $30 = 3

This means 3 people can go, but one of those people is Morgan. So, the number of friends she can invite is:
3 - 1 = 2

Morgan can invite 2 friends.

3. After buying the candy, he has some money left over. He spends half of this leftover money on gumballs.
4. Each gumball costs 5 cents, and he buys 40 gumballs.

First, let's figure out how much money Billy spent on the gumballs:
- Each gumball costs 5 cents, so 40 gumballs cost \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) cents.
- 200 cents is the same as $2.

Since he spent half of his leftover money on gumballs, the total leftover money before buying gumballs was:
- \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much money Billy spent on the candy:
- He started with $10 and had $4 left over, so he spent \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars on candy.

Finally, let's figure out how many pounds of candy he bought:
- The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds he bought is \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

Next, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4 times the number of people who didn't wear masks, minus 5. So, we do:
\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

Then, the number of people kicked out for fighting over goods is 3 times the number of shoplifters. So, we do:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, 21 people were kicked out for fighting.

Now, we add up all the people who were kicked out for these reasons:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out. So, to find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the reasons we know from the total:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 19 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. We know that Sara has 8 points.
2. After Erin scores 14 more points, she has three times as many points as Sara.
3. Three times Sara's points is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).
4. So, after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points.
5. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to take away the 14 points she just scored from her total of 24 points.
6. \(24 - 14 = 10\).

So, Erin had 10 points before she scored the additional 14 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a big puzzle!

1. **Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - So, the total cost for the picture frames is \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

2. **Etching:**
   - Each picture frame needs to be etched, which adds 20% to the cost.
   - 20% of $20 is \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - So, the additional cost for etching all the frames is \( 44 \times 4 = 176 \) dollars.

3. **Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will get pins.
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the pins is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

4. **Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - 1/4 of 44 is \( 44 \div 4 = 11 \) seniors.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - So, the total cost for the cords is \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add up all the costs:
   - Picture frames: $880
   - Etching: $176
   - Pins: $10
   - Cords: $132
   - Total: \( 880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \) dollars.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know the wallpaper costs $400 at the store. If Ethan makes it himself, he saves 20% of that cost. 

To find out how much 20% of $400 is, we can do this:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80 by making the wallpaper himself.

Now, to find out how much it costs him to make it, we subtract the savings from the original price:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

320"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: They sold double the number of pairs they sold on Friday. So, \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: They sold half the number of pairs they sold on Saturday. So, \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. But, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, the store actually sold \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) shoes.

So, the store sold 100 tennis shoes by the end of the sale.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. The company bought equipment worth $400,000.
2. Some of the equipment was faulty. The faulty equipment was 40% of the total.
3. To find out how much the faulty equipment cost, we need to calculate 40% of $400,000.

To find 40% of $400,000:
\[ 40\% \times 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

So, the faulty equipment cost $160,000.

4. Now, we need to find out how much the good (functioning) equipment cost. We do this by subtracting the cost of the faulty equipment from the total cost.

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the company spent $240,000 on the functioning pieces of equipment.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them give her 1 kg of milk each day, and the other half give her 2 kg of milk each day.

First, we need to find out how many sheep are in each half:
30 sheep ÷ 2 = 15 sheep in each half.

Now, let's calculate the milk from the first half:
15 sheep × 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk.

Next, let's calculate the milk from the second half:
15 sheep × 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk.

Finally, we add the milk from both halves to find the total:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk.

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

3. Now, we have 40 pupils in total, and 20 of them like blue. So, the number of pupils left is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).
4. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we need to find one-fourth of 20. That's \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \) pupils who like green.
5. Finally, we need to find out how many pupils like yellow. We have 20 pupils left, and 5 of them like green. So, the number of pupils who like yellow is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \).

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Monday:**
   - Lucy made $56 from selling apples.
   - Each apple costs $4.
   - To find out how many apples she sold, we divide the total money by the price per apple:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Karan borrowed $3,650 for 5 months. The interest rate is 10%. We need to find out how much she has to pay each month.

First, let's find out how much interest she will pay. The interest is calculated like this:

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   - Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
   - Principal = $3,650
   - Rate = 10% (which is 0.10 as a decimal)
   - Time = 5 months (which is 5/12 of a year)

   So, the interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   - Total Amount = Principal + Interest
   - Total Amount = 3650 + 152.50
   - Total Amount = 3802.50

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   - Monthly Payment = Total Amount ÷ Number of Months
   - Monthly Payment = 3802.50 ÷ 5
   - Monthly Payment = 760.50

So, Karan has to pay $760.50 each month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

1. First, we need to know how many days the builder works in one month. The builder works 4 weeks every month, and each week he works 6 days. So, we multiply:
   - 4 weeks × 6 days = 24 days in one month.

2. Next, we need to find out how many days the builder works in a whole year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply:
   - 24 days × 12 months = 288 days in a year.

3. Now, we need to calculate how much money the builder earns in a year. The builder gets paid $50 for each day he works. So, we multiply:
   - 288 days × $50 = $14,400 in a year.

So, the builder earns $14,400 in a year.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to figure out how much flour and milk Mark needs for his quadruple batch of brownies.

1. **Flour:**
   - The normal recipe needs 3 cups of flour.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups of flour.

2. **Milk:**
   - The normal recipe needs 1 cup of milk.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups of milk.

Next, we need to figure out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark has to buy.

3. **Bags of Flour:**
   - Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
   - Mark needs 12 cups of flour, so he needs \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour.

4. **Bottles of Milk:**
   - Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
   - Mark needs 4 cups of milk, so he needs \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk.

Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.

5. **Difference:**
   - Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.
   - The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\).

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we need to know how much energy the air conditioner uses in one hour. It uses 900 watts every hour.
2. Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day. So, the total energy used in one day is:
   \[
   900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watts}
   \]
3. If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he will use it for:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
4. The new total energy used in one day is:
   \[
   900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watts}
   \]
5. The energy saved each day is the difference between the original usage and the new usage:
   \[
   7200 \text{ watts} - 2700 \text{ watts} = 4500 \text{ watts}
   \]
6. To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
   \[
   4500 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135000 \text{ watts}
   \]
7. Since 1000 watts is equal to 1 kilowatt, we convert the total savings to kilowatts:
   \[
   \frac{135000 \text{ watts}}{1000} = 135 \text{ kilowatts}
   \]

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to count all the stripes on the zebras. We have:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each. So, \(17 + 17 = 34\) stripes.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the 36-striped zebra. Half of 36 is \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find out how many zebras there are:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- One zebra with 18 stripes.
So, there are \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\) zebras.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[ \frac{88}{4} = 22 \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

1. **How many sandwiches do we need?**
   - There are 20 people coming to the game.
   - Each sandwich can feed 4 people.
   - So, we need 20 ÷ 4 = 5 sandwiches.

2. **How much meat and cheese do we need?**
   - Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

3. **How much does the meat and cheese cost?**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - For 5 pounds of meat: 5 × $7.00 = $35.00
   - For 5 pounds of cheese: 5 × $3.00 = $15.00

4. **What is the total cost?**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
   - Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches for 20 people.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. First, we know that Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. The problem says that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. So, if he has 40 cannolis, he must have:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

3. Then, Allan buys 60 more cannolis. So now, the total number of cannolis he has is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

4. The problem also says that Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has now. So, if he has 100 cannolis, he buys:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. Now, we need to find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has. We add the new number of corns and cannolis:
   \[
   60 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 160

"Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps in a day. He already walked half of that, which is 5,000 steps, going to and from school. Then, he walked another 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

Let's see how many steps he took during his jog:

1. First, we add the steps he took to and from school and with his friend:
   5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

2. Elliott had 2,000 steps left after his jog, so we need to find out how many steps he took during the jog. We know he had 10,000 steps as his goal:
   10,000 (total goal) - 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps

3. Now, we subtract the steps he already took before the jog from the 8,000 steps:
   8,000 (steps before the jog) - 6,000 (steps already taken) = 2,000 steps

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words per page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it will take Toby to read all those words. Toby can read 300 words in one minute. So, we divide the total number of words by the number of words he can read per minute:
\[ 9000 \text{ words} \div 300 \text{ words per minute} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, but it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60 minutes are up:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he will have left before he needs to leave for the airport:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

First, we need to find out how much the company paid the employees in May. 

- There were 40 employees.
- Each employee worked 40 hours a week.
- They worked for 4 weeks in May.
- Each hour, they got paid $15.

So, for one employee in May:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ hours} \]
\[ 160 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, for all 40 employees:
\[ 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much the company paid in June.

- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees stayed.
- 3/4 of 40 employees is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

For one employee in June:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ hours} \]
\[ 160 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, for all 30 employees:
\[ 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the payments for May and June to get the total amount paid:

Next, Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, she bought 4 magnets, and each magnet costs $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the things Sally bought:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:

2. He buys another pack that costs twice as much as the first one. So, the second pack costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. Now, we add the cost of both packages: \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. To find the discount, we calculate \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. After the discount, the total cost of the two packages is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. Marcy makes 50,000 candles. She says they are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means 1% of the candles might explode.
2. To find out how many candles might explode, we need to calculate 1% of 50,000:

1. Joanne picks 30 apples from the tall trees.
2. She picks half of that from the short trees, so that's 15 apples.
3. We don't know how many apples she picks from the average trees, so let's call that number \( x \).

Now, her sister helps out:
1. Her sister picks twice as many apples from the tall trees as Joanne, so that's \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister picks three times as many apples from the short trees as Joanne, so that's \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister doesn't pick any apples from the average trees, so that's 0 apples.

Together, they picked a total of 500 apples. So, we can write this as:
\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Now, let's add up the numbers we know:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne picked 350 apples from the average trees.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in primary school.

We have a herd of camels and dromedaries. Camels have 2 humps, and dromedaries have 1 hump. We know there are 180 heads and 304 humps in total.

First, let's write down what we know:
- The total number of heads (camels + dromedaries) is 180.
- The total number of humps (2 for each camel, 1 for each dromedary) is 304.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many dromedaries there are.

1. **Step 1: Set up the equations.**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of camels.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.
   - We know:
     \[
     C + D = 180
     \]
     \[
     2C + D = 304
     \]

2. **Step 2: Solve the first equation for \( D \).**
   - From \( C + D = 180 \), we can write:
     \[
     D = 180 - C
     \]

3. **Step 3: Substitute \( D \) in the second equation.**
   - Replace \( D \) in \( 2C + D = 304 \) with \( 180 - C \):
     \[
     2C + (180 - C) = 304
     \]

4. **Step 4: Simplify the equation.**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     2C + 180 - C = 304
     \]
     \[
     C + 180 = 304
     \]

5. **Step 5: Solve for \( C \).**
   - Subtract 180 from both sides:
     \[
     C = 304 - 180
     \]
     \[
     C = 124
     \]

6. **Step 6: Find \( D \).**
   - Substitute \( C = 124 \) back into \( D = 180 - C \):
     \[
     D = 180 - 124
     \]
     \[
     D = 56
     \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"Okay, let's figure out how many kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week trip.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - So, for 4 days, he traveled: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers is: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers.

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all, so he traveled 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - So, for 7 days, he traveled: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers.

Now, let's add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:

   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - So, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - So, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - So, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

Lillian wants to add some bird feeders to her garden. She builds 3 feeders and buys 3 more. That means she has 6 feeders in total.

Now, each of the feeders she bought from the store attracts 20 birds. So, for the 3 store-bought feeders:
- 3 feeders × 20 birds each = 60 birds

The feeders Lillian made herself are extra special and attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. So, each homemade feeder attracts:
- 20 birds + 10 birds = 30 birds

For the 3 homemade feeders:
- 3 feeders × 30 birds each = 90 birds

Now, we add the birds from the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders:
- 60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Aleksandra had to pay for her dinner.

1. The bagel costs $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we do:
   - 25% of $4 is \( \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 1 \)
   - So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is:
   - \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)
   - So, the cake costs $2.

Now, we add up the costs:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost: \( 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \)

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner.

"Kenny wants to go to an amusement park, and the ticket costs $100. He also wants to have $50 extra for spending. So, he needs to make $150 in total by selling his Pokemon cards. Each card sells for $1.5.

First, let's find out how many cards he needs to sell to make $150:
\[ \text{Number of cards to sell} = \frac{\text{Total money needed}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them. If 100 cards are 2/3 of his total cards, we can find the total number of cards he started with:
\[ \text{Total cards} = \frac{100}{2/3} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First, we need to figure out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each.
   - 18 guests getting 2 hotdogs each means \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The other 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each, so \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - In total, the caterer prepared \(36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

2. **Now, let's see what happened when 40 guests showed up:**
   - Each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
   - So, they needed \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hotdogs in total.

3. **How many hotdogs were missing?**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - They needed 80 hotdogs, so they were short by \(80 - 54 = 26\) hotdogs.

4. **How many guests did not get a second hotdog?**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, and there were 26 hotdogs missing, 26 guests did not get their second hotdog.

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

First, we know that Indras has 6 letters in her name. That's easy to count: I-N-D-R-A-S.

Now, we need to figure out how many letters are in her sister's name. The problem says her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

So, let's find half of the letters in Indras' name:
- Half of 6 is 3.

Next, we add 4 more letters to this:
- 3 + 4 = 7.

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to find the total:
- Indras has 6 letters.
- Her sister has 7 letters.
- 6 + 7 = 13.

So, the total number of letters in both names is 13.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up all the things Charlotte wants to buy:
- The pots and pans cost $120.00.
- The mixing bowls cost $20.00.
- Each utensil costs $5.00, and she wants 5 of them, so that's 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these all together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

So, before any discounts, everything costs $165.00.

Next, the store is giving a 20% discount on everything. To find out how much the discount is, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

So, the discount is $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, after the discount, Charlotte's order costs $132.00.

132.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up how much all the things Dora wants to buy cost:
- The skipping rope costs $6.
- The board game costs $11.
- The playground ball costs $2.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we need to see how much money Dora has:
- She saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mom gave her $16.

So, the total money Dora has is:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs to buy everything. We do this by subtracting the total money she has from the total cost:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. To find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew, we need to multiply 100 by 3/4:
   \[
   100 \times \frac{3}{4} = 75
   \]
   So, Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. To find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew, we need to multiply 75 by 2:
   \[
   75 \times 2 = 150
   \]
   So, Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to multiply 150 by 1/5:

1. First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. We have 15 gallons of gas, and it's divided equally into 5 containers. So, we divide 15 by 5:
   \[
   15 \div 5 = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
   \]

2. Next, Josey needs 1/4 of a container. So, we need to find out how much 1/4 of 3 gallons is. We do this by dividing 3 by 4:
   \[
   3 \div 4 = 0.75 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **How much money did George have left?**
   - George started with $5.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1 cent out of every 100 cents left.
   - 1% of $5 is \( 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05 \) dollars, or 5 cents.
   - So, George had 5 cents left.

2. **How much did George spend?**
   - If George had 5 cents left, he spent \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

3. **How much did the chips cost?**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - So, the total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

4. **How much did George spend on candy bars?**
   - George spent a total of $4.95.
   - He spent $1.20 on chips.
   - So, the amount he spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

5. **How many candy bars did George buy?**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   - To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: \( 3.75 \div 0.75 = 5 \).

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

1. **Onions:**
   - The recipe needs 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine likes to double that, so he uses 2 times 2 pounds, which is 4 pounds of onions.
   - Onions cost $2.00 per pound.
   - So, 4 pounds of onions cost 4 times $2.00, which is $8.00.

2. **Beef Stock:**
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - Each box costs $2.00.
   - So, 2 boxes of beef stock cost 2 times $2.00, which is $4.00.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the onions and beef stock is $8.00 + $4.00, which is $12.00.

4. **Cost per Serving:**

3. **Bernadette's Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to arrive at \( 4 - 5 = -1 \) minute (which means 1 minute before the 4-minute mark).

4. **Bernadette's Departure Time:**
   - Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before she wants to arrive.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that the area of Billie's bedroom is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width. We also know that the length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, 3 yards is equal to 9 feet.

So, we have:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 9 feet

To find the width, we use the formula for the area:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can rearrange this to solve for the width:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ \text{Width} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up all the sides:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

First, we need to figure out how long it took Jon to finish the whole race. Jon did:
- The swim in 40 minutes
- The bike ride in 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes
- The run in 50 minutes

So, we add these times together:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's look at James. James did:
- The swim 10% faster than Jon. If Jon took 40 minutes, 10% of 40 is 4 minutes. So, James took:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]
- The bike ride 5 minutes longer than Jon. So, James took:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

We know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes longer than Jon's total time. Jon's total time was 170 minutes, so James took:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long James took to run. We know the total time for James and the times for the swim and bike:
\[ 36 + 85 + \text{run time} = 180 \]

Let's solve for the run time:
\[ 36 + 85 + \text{run time} = 180 \]
\[ 121 + \text{run time} = 180 \]
\[ \text{run time} = 180 - 121 \]

1.25 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Next, the problem tells us that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

So, Movie B is 80 minutes long.

Finally, the problem says that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find out how long Movie A is, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

   \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles per hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So for 16 miles:
   \[
   \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay}

2. **Regular Ticket Cost:**
   - The regular movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - We need to find out how much the popcorn costs. Let's call the cost of the popcorn \( P \).

3. **Total Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The total cost without the super ticket is $12 (ticket) + $3 (soda) + \( P \) (popcorn).
   - So, the total cost is $15 + \( P \).

4. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - So, $15 + \( P \) = $21 - $2.
   - This simplifies to $15 + \( P \) = $19.

5. **Solving for \( P \):**
   - To find \( P \), we subtract $15 from both sides of the equation.
   - \( P \) = $19 - $15.
   - \( P \) = $4.

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."

Next, we need to find out the value of the sapphires she has left:
- Each sapphire is worth $800.
- She has 5 sapphires.
- So, the value of the sapphires is 5 × 800 = $4000.

Now, let's find out the value of the rubies she got:
- She got 2 rubies.
- Each ruby is worth $1200.
- So, the value of the rubies is 2 × 1200 = $2400.

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
- The value of the sapphires is $4000.
- The value of the rubies is $2400.
- So, the total value is 4000 + 2400 = $6400.

The total value of all her jewels is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

Marin eats 4 apples every day. Nancy also eats 4 apples every day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples each day.

Now, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. If they eat 8 apples each day, then in 30 days, they will eat 8 apples/day × 30 days = 240 apples.

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is 240.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much soil one raised bed needs. Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

So, one raised bed needs 32 cubic feet of soil.

Bob has 10 raised beds, so we need to find out how much soil all the beds need together:

\[ 10 \, \text{beds} \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet per bed} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total cubic feet by the amount each bag holds:

\[ 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \div 2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Red Cards**: We know there are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The problem says there are 60% more green cards than red cards. 
   - First, we need to find out what 60% of 15 is. 
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards.
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the same as the total number of red and green cards added together.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, let's add up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

So, the total number of cards is 78.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest. That's a lot of fairies!

Then, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn. Half of 50 is 25. So, 25 more fairies came from the east and joined the 50 fairies already there. 

Now, we add the 50 fairies and the 25 fairies together:
50 + 25 = 75 fairies

After a little while, 30 fairies flew away. So, we need to subtract 30 from the 75 fairies that were there:
75 - 30 = 45 fairies

So, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. So, we add these together too:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we want to find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots. To do this, we divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \frac{7}{20} \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

"Okay, let's figure out how many trips the farmer needs to make to carry all the feed for his horses.

First, we need to add up the weight of all the feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound each = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds each = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds each = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds each = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add all these weights together:

2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

4500 pounds ÷ 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

1. First, we need to know how much money Grayson makes from the cans each week:
   - Grayson drinks 3 cans of soda.
   - Each can is worth 2 cents.
   - So, 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents from cans each week.

2. Next, we need to know how much money Grayson makes from the bottles each week:
   - Grayson drinks 5 bottles of water.
   - Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - So, 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents from bottles each week.

3. Now, we add the money from the cans and the bottles to find out how much Grayson makes in one week:
   - 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents each week.

4. Finally, we need to find out how much Grayson makes in a four-week month:
   - 21 cents each week * 4 weeks = 84 cents in a month.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. That's easy to remember, right?

Next, Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many more plants that is, we need to figure out what 60% of 10 is. 

60% of 10 is the same as 60 out of 100, which is 0.60. So, we multiply 10 by 0.60:
\[ 10 \times 0.60 = 6 \]

So, Toni has 6 more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we need to subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

First, we need to find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks, and each deck has 25 cards. So, we do:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]
So, Miss Maria has 150 basketball cards.

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards she has. She has 5 boxes, and each box has 40 cards. So, we do:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]
So, Miss Maria has 200 baseball cards.

Now, we add the basketball cards and the baseball cards to find the total number of cards:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]
So, Miss Maria has 350 cards in total.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself. So, we subtract the 50 cards she keeps from the total number of cards:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]
So, she gives away 300 cards to her students.

Each student gets 10 cards. To find out how many students there are, we divide the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student gets:
\[ 300 \div 10 = 30 \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students.

First, let's see how much Becky paid:
- Becky bought 20 apples.
- Each apple costs 45 cents.
- So, 20 apples cost \(20 \times 45\) cents, which is 900 cents.
- 900 cents is the same as 9 dollars.
- Becky got a $1 discount.
- So, Becky paid \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's see how much Kelly paid:
- Kelly also bought 20 apples.
- Each apple costs 50 cents.
- So, 20 apples cost \(20 \times 50\) cents, which is 1000 cents.
- 1000 cents is the same as 10 dollars.
- Kelly got a 10% discount.
- 10% of 10 dollars is \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- So, Kelly paid \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has 4 pillow cases (because there are 2 sheets and twice as many pillow cases as sheets).
- Each room has 8 towels (because there are 4 pillow cases and twice as many towels as pillow cases).

Now, let's count how many of each thing there are in 80 rooms:
- Sheets: 2 sheets per room × 80 rooms = 160 sheets
- Comforters: 1 comforter per room × 80 rooms = 80 comforters
- Pillow cases: 4 pillow cases per room × 80 rooms = 320 pillow cases
- Towels: 8 towels per room × 80 rooms = 640 towels

Finally, we add all these up to find the total number of pieces of laundry:
- 160 sheets + 80 comforters + 320 pillow cases + 640 towels = 1200 pieces of laundry

   - Now he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

3. **Shoes he gets on Wednesday:**
   - He gets 15 pairs of shoes.
   - 15 pairs = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
   - Now he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

4. **Shoes he gets on Friday:**
   - He gets 30 pairs of shoes.

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.

So, if Matt eats \( c \) carrot sticks, he can have:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants 5 cookies, so we can write:

Now, let's solve for \( c \):

1. First, we need to get rid of the 2 on the right side. We do this by subtracting 2 from both sides:
   \[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
   \[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

2. Next, we need to get rid of the \(\frac{1}{2}\) in front of \( c \). We do this by multiplying both sides by 2:

1. Convert the remoras' lengths to feet:
   - 1 foot = 12 inches
   - 6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet
   - 2 remoras = 2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

2. Now, we need to find out what part of the shark's length the remoras' length is. We do this by dividing the length of the remoras by the length of the shark:
   - 1 foot (remoras) / 10 feet (shark) = 0.1

3. To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100:

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, to find the total weight of both pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny together:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **First, we need to know how much oats one horse eats in one day:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - So, one horse eats 5 pounds × 2 meals = 10 pounds of oats per day.

2. **Next, we need to know how much oats all four horses eat in one day:**
   - If one horse eats 10 pounds of oats per day, then four horses eat 10 pounds × 4 horses = 40 pounds of oats per day.

3. **Now, we need to know how much oats all four horses eat in five days:**
   - If the horses eat 40 pounds of oats per day, then in five days they eat 40 pounds × 5 days = 200 pounds of oats.

4. **Finally, we need to know how many 50-pound bags of oats are needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total amount of oats by the amount in one bag: 200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to know how many eggs each tray can hold. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.

Next, we need to know how many trays Jaime has. Jaime has 2 trays.

Now, let's find out how many eggs Jaime can put on the trays. We do this by multiplying the number of eggs each tray can hold by the number of trays:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs in total. We need to find out how many eggs won't fit on the trays. We do this by subtracting the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs:

1. **Cost of Razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - There are 4 razors in each pack.

2. **Buy One Get One Free:**
   - If Heather buys 1 pack, she gets another pack for free.
   - So, for $4.00, she gets 2 packs.

3. **Using the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After using the coupon, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00

First, we need to figure out how tall each layer of the pyramid is. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, will be at the top.

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   - So, 4 girls × 64 inches = 256 inches

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   - So, 3 girls × 64 inches = 192 inches

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   - So, 2 girls × 64 inches = 128 inches

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   - So, 1 girl × 60 inches = 60 inches

Now, we add up all these heights to find the total height of the pyramid:
- 256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches

To find out how tall the pyramid is in feet, we need to divide the total inches by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
- 636 inches ÷ 12 = 53 feet

So, the height of the human pyramid is:

   - So, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

2. **Afternoon Rides:**
   - Each afternoon ride costs $2.
   - He drives in the afternoon for 14 days.
   - So, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - To find the total amount of money Paul spent, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides.

Now, we add the oranges that Ashley and Brianne brought together to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To make one Greek orange pie, we need 3 oranges. So, we divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Mark has two choices for a party place. The first place costs $200 no matter how many friends come, but he also needs to pay $5 for each friend for food. The second place costs $25 for each friend, and that includes the food.

We want to find out how many friends need to come so that both places cost the same.

Let's use a simple way to figure this out:

1. **First place cost:** $200 + $5 for each friend
2. **Second place cost:** $25 for each friend

We need to find the number of friends (let's call it \( x \)) where both costs are the same.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve it step by step:

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
   \[ 200 = 20x \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ x = 10 \]

So, if 10 friends come to the party, both places will cost the same.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that Lily, David, and Bodhi together found 43 insects. That's a lot of bugs!

We also know that:
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many insects each of them found.

1. Let's say David found \( D \) insects.
2. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. Since David found half as many insects as Bodhi, Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

Now, we can write an equation to show the total number of insects they found together:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ D + D + 7 + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( D \):
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects.

Now, we can find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. We need to find out how much yarn they used together.

First, let's add the fractions:
- Mariah used 1/4 of a skein.
- Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein.

To add these, we need to make the bottom numbers (denominators) the same. The smallest number that both 4 and 2 can go into is 4. So, we change 1/2 to 2/4.

Now we add:
1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

So, together they used 3/4 of a skein.

Next, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. We know that a full skein has 364 yards.

To find 3/4 of 364, we can do this:
3/4 × 364 = (3 × 364) ÷ 4

First, multiply 3 by 364:
3 × 364 = 1092

Then, divide 1092 by 4:
1092 ÷ 4 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

First, let's add up the cost of the grape and green apple gum:
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $1
- Total for grape and green apple: $2 + $1 = $3

Now, we know that the total cost for all the gum is $7. So, the cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum is:
- Total cost - Cost of grape and green apple gum: $7 - $3 = $4

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry gum by 2:
- Cost of each pack of strawberry gum: $4 ÷ 2 = $2

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Next, Ali gives half of this money to his sister. Half of 160 dollars is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

After giving 80 dollars to his sister, Ali has:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 80 dollars to buy dinner. To find out how much he spends on dinner, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We need to change this to minutes because the question asks for the answer in minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes, so:
2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes

Next, the problem says that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find out what double Rob's time is:

Double Rob's time = 120 minutes × 2 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the extra 40 minutes that Royce takes:

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle the house.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Martha is making winter clothes for her 3 grandchildren. Each grandchild will get:
- 1 hat
- 1 scarf
- 1 sweater
- 1 pair of mittens
- 1 pair of socks

Now, let's see how many skeins of wool she needs for each item:
- A hat needs 2 skeins
- A scarf needs 4 skeins
- A sweater needs 12 skeins
- A pair of mittens needs 1 skein
- A pair of socks needs 2 skeins

First, let's add up the skeins needed for one grandchild:
2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we need to multiply the total for one grandchild by 3:
21 skeins/child × 3 children = 63 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math puzzle!

1. Chris has 100 math problems to do.
2. On Monday, he does 12 problems.
   - So, he has \(100 - 12 = 88\) problems left.
3. On Tuesday, he does 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
   - He did 12 problems on Monday, so on Tuesday he does \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.
   - Now, he has \(88 - 36 = 52\) problems left.
4. On Wednesday, he does one-quarter of the remaining problems.
   - One-quarter of 52 is \(52 \div 4 = 13\) problems.
   - So, he has \(52 - 13 = 39\) problems left.

So, Chris has 39 problems left to do on Thursday.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks 1 quart less than Tony.
   - So, Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby.
   - So, Kathy picks 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks 2 quarts less than Kathy.
   - So, Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

5. **Total picking rate:**
   - Now, we add up all the quarts they can pick together.
   - Total = Tony's quarts + Bobby's quarts + Kathy's quarts + Ricky's quarts
   - Total = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips, and he can fit 6 red tulips in each row. So, we divide 36 by 6:
\[ 36 \div 6 = 6 \]
So, Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, we need to figure out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips, and he can fit 8 blue tulips in each row. So, we divide 24 by 8:
\[ 24 \div 8 = 3 \]
So, Jackson can plant 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips together to find the total number of rows:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \]

So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers in total.

"Heather has a big bag of raisins with 27 cups in it. She wants to use the raisins to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. She decides to split the raisins equally for each thing.

First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins she will use for the oatmeal cookies. Since she is splitting the raisins equally, we divide the total number of cups by 3:

27 cups ÷ 3 = 9 cups

So, Heather will use 9 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies.

Next, we need to figure out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make. Each batch needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we divide the 9 cups by 3/4:

9 cups ÷ 3/4 cup per batch = 9 × 4/3 = 12 batches

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First, we need to find out how much Ada spends on electricity each day right now.**
   - Ada uses 12 kilowatts per hour.
   - Each kilowatt per hour costs $1.50.
   - So, her daily cost is \( 12 \times 1.50 = 18 \) dollars.

2. **Next, we need to find out how much the new device will cost each day.**
   - The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour.
   - Each kilowatt per hour costs $1.50.
   - So, the new device will cost \( 2 \times 1.50 = 3 \) dollars each day.

3. **Now, we add the cost of the new device to Ada's current daily cost.**
   - Current daily cost is 18 dollars.
   - New device cost is 3 dollars.
   - Total daily cost after adding the new device is \( 18 + 3 = 21 \) dollars.

4. **We need to find out how much Ada spends on electricity each week before and after adding the new device.**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Current weekly cost is \( 18 \times 7 = 126 \) dollars.
   - New weekly cost is \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) dollars.

5. **Finally, we find the difference between the two weekly costs.**
   - New weekly cost is 147 dollars.
   - Current weekly cost is 126 dollars.
   - The difference is \( 147 - 126 = 21 \) dollars.

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they can paint a whole house in 10 days. That's because 5 days is for half, so 10 days is for the whole house.
2. Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, and there are 24 hours in a day, then one person would take 10 days times 24 hours, which is 240 hours to paint the whole house.
3. If 5 people are working together, they can do the job faster. We divide the total hours by 5, so 240 hours divided by 5 people is 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas. The problem says she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we add 2 to the number of sofas, we get the number of chairs Ophelia has.
   - Ophelia's chairs: 20 + 2 = 22

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we multiply the number of Ophelia's chairs by 3 to find out how many chairs Jenna has.
   - Jenna's chairs: 22 × 3 = 66

3. The problem also says Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we subtract 2 from the number of Jenna's chairs, we get the number of sofas Jenna has.
   - Jenna's sofas: 66 - 2 = 64

4. Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs:
   - Total sofas: 20 (Ophelia's) + 64 (Jenna's) = 84
   - Total chairs: 22 (Ophelia's) + 66 (Jenna's) = 88

1. First, we know the total amount Tom paid is $48.
2. We also know the CD cost $4.
3. To find out how much the headphone set cost, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount:
   \[
   48 - 4 = 44

   So, the headphone set cost $44.

4. Now, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44.
5. Each CD costs $4, so we divide the $44 by the cost of one CD:

Josh tracked his workouts for 8 weeks. Most of the time, he worked out for 4 hours each week. But there were some weeks when he worked out more:

1. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
2. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, let's find out how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours:
- Total weeks: 8
- Weeks he worked out for 5 hours: 2
- Week he worked out for 6 hours: 1
- So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each type of week:
- For the 5 weeks he worked out for 4 hours: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours
- For the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours
- For the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

Finally, let's add all these hours together:
- Total hours: \(20 + 10 + 6 = 36\) hours

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. At the start, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 people get off the bus. So, we subtract 8 from 48:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
   Now, there are 40 people on the bus.
3. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 more people get on the bus. Now, we add 40 to the 40 people already on the bus:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
   Now, there are 80 people on the bus.
4. On the second stop, 21 people get off the bus. So, we subtract 21 from 80:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
   Now, there are 59 people on the bus.
5. Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer means:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 more people get on the bus. Now, we add 7 to the 59 people already on the bus:

2. **Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

3. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**

4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 × 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add them all up:
- First book: 31 mm
- Second book: 50 mm
- Third book: 45 mm
- Fourth book: 62 mm

So, the tip is $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill:
$50 + $10 = $60

The total bill is $60. Since you and your wife are splitting the bill, each of you would normally pay half of $50, which is:
$50 / 2 = $25

   - April has 30 days.

2. **Now, let's split April into two halves.**
   - The first half has 15 days.
   - The second half also has 15 days.

3. **Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.**
   - Let's say he saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half.
   - So, in the first half, he saves \( 15x \) dollars in total.
   - In the second half, he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day.
   - So, in the second half, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars in total.

4. **Elvis's total savings for the month should be $1125.**
   - So, the total savings from both halves of the month is \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).
   - We know that \( 45x = 1125 \).

5. **Now, we need to find out what \( x \) is.**
   - We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
     \[
     x = \frac{1125}{45}

   - If we do the division, we get:
     \[
     x = 25

6. **So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half.**
   - In the second half, he saves twice that amount each day, which is:

   - So, 3 apples * $1.50 = $4.50.

2. For the oranges:
   - Verna bought 5 oranges.
   - Each orange costs $0.80.
   - So, 5 oranges * $0.80 = $4.00.

3. For the peaches:
   - Verna bought 6 peaches.
   - Each peach costs $0.75.
   - So, 6 peaches * $0.75 = $4.50.

- Geometry set: 1 geometry set at $10.00 each. So, \(1 \times 10.00 = 10.00\).

Now, let's add up all these costs:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find the discount amount:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

So, Daniel has to spend:
\[27.00\]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much Carly spent on the hamburgers:
   - She bought 5 hamburgers, and each one costs $4.
   - So, 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20.

2. Next, let's find out how much she spent on the potato fries:
   - She bought 10 packs of potato fries, and each pack costs $0.30.
   - So, 10 packs * $0.30 each = $3.

3. Now, let's find out how much she spent on the fruit drinks:
   - She bought 5 cans of fruit drinks, and each can costs $2.
   - So, 5 cans * $2 each = $10.

4. Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Carly spent:
   - Total cost = $20 (hamburgers) + $3 (potato fries) + $10 (fruit drinks) = $33.

5. Finally, we need to find out how much change Carly gets back:
   - She gave a fifty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost from $50.
   - Change = $50 - $33 = $17.

So, Carly gets back $17 in change.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Antonella made from selling stuff worth $2500.

First, we need to know how much she makes for the first $1000. She gets 30% of that. So, we do:
\[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]
So, she makes $300 for the first $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much she makes for the rest of the money she sold, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500. For this part, she gets 10%. So, we do:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]
So, she makes $150 for the extra $1500.

Now, we add both parts together to find out her total earnings:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, Antonella earned $450.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Bill has 2 cases of water. Each case has 24 bottles. So, we need to find out how many bottles that is in total:
\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, Bill has 70 guests, and he wants each guest to have 2 bottles of water. So, we need to find out how many bottles that is in total:
\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we know Bill already has 48 bottles, but he needs 140 bottles in total. To find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:
\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know that when the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. 

Now, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, we need to figure out what ""twice as long"" means and then add 2 minutes to it.

Twice as long as 16 minutes is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add 2 minutes to 32 minutes:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how much money John makes in one week. He works 5 hours each day for 4 days a week. So, we multiply the hours he works each day by the number of days he works in a week:
5 hours/day × 4 days/week = 20 hours/week

Next, we need to find out how much money he makes in those 20 hours. He gets paid $2 for each hour he works. So, we multiply the number of hours he works in a week by his pay rate:
20 hours/week × $2/hour = $40/week

Now, we know John makes $40 each week. He wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by the amount he makes each week:
$80 ÷ $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

1. **Find the number of buttons with 4 holes:**
   - Total buttons: 21
   - Buttons with 2 holes: 7
   - So, buttons with 4 holes: 21 - 7 = 14

2. **Calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 2 holes:**
   - Each of these 7 buttons has 2 holes.
   - Total holes for these buttons: 7 × 2 = 14

3. **Calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 4 holes:**
   - Each of these 14 buttons has 4 holes.
   - Total holes for these buttons: 14 × 4 = 56

4. **Add the two totals together to get the total number of holes:**
   - Total holes from buttons with 2 holes: 14

First, we know that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. That's the size of his locker.

Now, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's. So, we need to find half of 24. We can do this by dividing 24 by 2:
\[ 24 \div 2 = 12 \]
So, Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches.

Next, Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's. To find 1/4 of 12, we divide 12 by 4:
\[ 12 \div 4 = 3 \]
So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

Then, there are 3 cages with guinea pigs, and each cage has 5 guinea pigs. So, for the guinea pigs, we have:

3 cages × 5 guinea pigs/cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, to find the total number of rodents, we add the hamsters and the guinea pigs together:

30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop has 45 rodents in total.

First, we need to find out how much Susan weighs. Mark weighs 150 pounds, and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. So, we do:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \]
Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. So, we do:
\[ 130 \times 2 = 260 \]
Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. We add their weights together:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]
The total weight is 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:

First, we need to find out how many pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, we multiply 15 minutes by 7 nights:
\[ 15 \times 7 = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to know how many pages she can read in those 105 minutes. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages per minute} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pages she reads per minute by the total minutes she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages per minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

So, Judy read 140 pages in the first week.

In the second week, she read 100 pages. To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks:

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford can grow each week:
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.

Now, let's see how many roses Ford is short each week:
65 (roses needed) - 40 (roses grown) = 25 roses short each week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to find out how many roses Ford is short in a month:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Maggie's oven is a bit tricky. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually gets to 468 degrees. That means it's a bit too hot. We need to figure out how much too hot it is, and then use that to find out what temperature she should set it to if she wants it to be 520 degrees.

First, let's see how much too hot it is when she sets it to 450 degrees:
- The oven is set to 450 degrees.
- It actually gets to 468 degrees.
- So, it's 468 - 450 = 18 degrees too hot.

Now, we need to find out what percentage 18 degrees is of 450 degrees:
- 18 out of 450 is the same as 18 ÷ 450 = 0.04.
- To make it a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.04 × 100 = 4%.

So, the oven is 4% too hot when set to 450 degrees.

Now, we want the oven to be 520 degrees. We need to find out what temperature Maggie should set it to so that it ends up being 520 degrees, even though it's 4% too hot.

Let's call the temperature she should set it to ""x"". If the oven is 4% too hot, then:
- The actual temperature will be x + 4% of x.
- 4% of x is 0.04 × x.
- So, the actual temperature will be x + 0.04x = 1.04x.

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:
- 1.04x = 520.

To find x, we divide both sides by 1.04:
- x = 520 ÷ 1.04 = 500.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to get it to 520 degrees.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, we add 120 minutes and 5 minutes:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the minutes of both movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch both movies.

"Herb told me he paid $76,000 for his house. If Juan's house is 30% less expensive, we need to find out how much less that is and then add the two house values together.

First, let's find 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is $22,800 less than Herb's house. Now, let's find out how much Juan's house is worth:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, Judy bought 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups. So, if she bought 12 cups, she bought:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ dishes} \]

Next, her friend brought 40 cups. Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought:
\[ 24 + 20 = 44 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, let's add up all the cups and dishes that Judy and her friend brought:

Judy's total:
\[ 12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36 \text{ utensils} \]

Her friend's total:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} + 44 \text{ dishes} = 84 \text{ utensils} \]

Finally, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:
\[ 36 + 84 = 120 \]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much 2 boxes of contacts cost with the discount. Each box is $100, but there's a 10% discount. 

10% of $100 is $10. So, each box costs:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts are in 2 boxes. Each box has 90 contacts, and since Pete uses 2 contacts a day, each box has:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pairs} \]

So, 2 boxes have:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180}{90} = 2 \]

So, each pair of contacts costs:
\[ 2.00 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many hours Jill worked:
- On Saturday, Jill worked 2 hours.
- On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour.
So, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many hours John worked:
- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill. Since Jill worked 2 hours, John worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill. Since Jill worked 1 hour, John worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them earned:
- Jill earns $10 per hour, so she earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John earns $10 per hour, so he earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we need to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- John earned $70, and Jill earned $30.
- The difference is $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to know how many calories Hannah burns in total. She does two types of exercise: aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- She does aerobics for 2 hours.
- Each hour, she burns 500 calories.
- So, for 2 hours, she burns 2 hours × 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She runs for 1 hour.
- Each hour, she burns 600 calories.
- So, for 1 hour, she burns 1 hour × 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both exercises:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink. For every 200 calories burned, she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

- For 1600 calories, we divide 1600 by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she has:
  1600 ÷ 200 = 8 units.

- Each unit needs 100 ml of water, so:
  8 units × 100 ml/unit = 800 ml of water.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know there are three types of jelly beans: red, blue, and green. The note on the jar tells us:
- There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
- There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

So, the number of red jelly beans is \( B - 1\% \) of \( B \), which is \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \).

And the number of green jelly beans is \( B + 1\% \) of \( B \), which is \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Now, let's add these up:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we know:
- The number of blue jelly beans is 1500.
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would lose:
1.25 pounds/week × 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would gain:
1.75 pounds/week × 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, to find out the difference in his weight between the two options, we add the weight he would lose to the weight he would gain:
6.25 pounds + 8.75 pounds = 15 pounds

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 15 pounds.

   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people will bring 2 friends.
   - So, for each person, there are 2 more people coming.
   - That means \(100 \times 2 = 200\) extra people.

2. **Total from Email Invitations:**
   - The total number of people from the email invitations is \(100 + 200 = 300\).

3. **Phone Calls:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - So, for each of these 8 friends, there is 1 more person coming.

Let's write down the height of the beanstalk each day:

- On Day 0, the beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- On Day 1, it doubles to 4 feet × 2 = 8 feet.
- On Day 2, it doubles again to 8 feet × 2 = 16 feet.
- On Day 3, it doubles once more to 16 feet × 2 = 32 feet.

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Let's figure out how old he is now.

1. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means if we take his age 5 years ago and double it, we get his current age.
2. Let's say Jerry was \( x \) years old 5 years ago. So, his current age is \( 2x \).
3. But we also know that 5 years ago, he was \( x \) years old, so his current age is \( x + 5 \).

Now we can set up an equation:
\[ 2x = x + 5 \]

Let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x - x = 5 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 years ago, Jerry was 5 years old. That means his current age is:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

We know that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. That's a rule we learned in math class.

Now, we have three angles:
- The smallest angle, let's call it \( x \).
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's \( 2x \).
- Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's \( 3x \).

We can write this as:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Now, let's add up the \( x \)'s:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle:

Let's count the money step by step:

1. **Quarters:**
   - 1 quarter = 25 cents
   - 8 quarters = 8 × 25 = 200 cents

2. **Dimes:**
   - 1 dime = 10 cents
   - 6 dimes = 6 × 10 = 60 cents

3. **Nickels:**
   - 1 nickel = 5 cents
   - 14 nickels = 14 × 5 = 70 cents

4. **Pennies:**
   - 1 penny = 1 cent
   - 15 pennies = 15 × 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add all the money together:
- Total = 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

First, we need to figure out how many times the tires turn when Jeremy drives 400 miles in a month. We know that for every 2 miles, the tires turn 725 times. So, for 400 miles, we can do this:

1. Find out how many 2-mile segments are in 400 miles:
   \[
   400 \div 2 = 200
   \]

2. Now, multiply the number of 2-mile segments by the number of rotations per segment:
   \[
   200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
   \]

So, the tires turn 145,000 times in one month.

Next, we need to find out how many times the tires turn in one year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[
145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}
\]

Now, we know that each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. We need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach this number of rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tire can handle by the number of rotations per year:

If Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes because she's using half the amount of shampoo each time. So, 120 washes with 2 pumps means she will get 240 washes with 1 pump.

Now, we need to find out how much each pump costs. We do this by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps.

$24.00 ÷ 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since we need the answer in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 = 10 cents

\[ 490 \times 194 = 95060 \]
So, it costs $95,060 to repave Lewis' street.

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:
\[ 95060 - 29100 = 65960 \]

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First 5 months:**
   - John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - So, for each of these 5 months, he gets $100,000 ÷ 5 = $20,000.

2. **Total research time:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the first 5 months.
   - So, the total research time is 5 months × 10 = 50 months.

3. **Additional months:**
   - After the first 5 months, there are 50 months - 5 months = 45 more months.
   - For these extra months, John needs 50% more money each month.
   - 50% more than $20,000 is $20,000 + ($20,000 × 0.5) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.
   - So, for each of the 45 extra months, he needs $30,000.
   - The total cost for these 45 months is 45 months × $30,000 = $1,350,000.

4. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost is the cost for the first 5 months plus the cost for the extra 45 months.
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

So, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each beef tip is 1 ounce. So, 8 beef tips * 1 ounce each = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is the same as 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

So, the team ate a total of 30 ounces of meat.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know there are 1000 members in the Reddit group. Each member posts 3 posts every day. So, to find out how many posts are made in one day, we multiply the number of members by the number of posts each member makes:

1000 members × 3 posts/member/day = 3000 posts/day

Now, we need to find out how many posts are made in the whole month of March. March has 31 days. So, we multiply the number of posts made in one day by the number of days in March:

3000 posts/day × 31 days = 93000 posts

So, the total number of posts in March is 93000.

93000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

First, we need to know how many times Gary does laundry in a year. He does it twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ times/year} \]

Next, each time he does laundry, he uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total amount of water he uses in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ times/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/time} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how much this water costs. Water costs $0.15 per gallon. So, the total cost for the water is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Scarlett spent. We'll add up all the things she bought:

1. The aquarium cost $10.00.
2. She bought 2 bags of rocks, and each bag costs $2.50. So, 2 bags cost 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
3. She bought 3 pieces of coral, and each piece costs $2.00. So, 3 pieces cost 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
4. She bought 20 fish, and each fish costs $0.50. So, 20 fish cost 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
5. She also bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add all these amounts together:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Jane's beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week. That's like the height of a small pencil.

Then, in the second week, it doubled in height. Doubling means we multiply by 2. So, 3 inches times 2 is 6 inches. Now the beanstalk is as tall as a ruler.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. We add 4 inches to the 6 inches it was already. So, 6 inches plus 4 inches equals 10 inches.

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Prince is a butcher, and he sells 15 kilograms of meat every hour. He works for 10 hours each day. So, we need to find out how much meat he sells in one day.

1. First, we calculate how much meat Prince sells in one day:
   \[
   15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day}
   \]

2. Next, we know that the bull given by Bill weighs 750 kilograms. We need to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all 750 kilograms of meat.

3. To do this, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
   \[
   \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days}
   \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

Next, we find out how many seats the administrators took. They took one-fourth of the seats. So, we divide 72 by 4:
\[ 72 \div 4 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we need to find out how many seats are left after the administrators have taken theirs. We subtract the seats the administrators took from the total number of seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Then, we find out how many seats the parents took. They took one-third of the remaining seats. So, we divide 54 by 3:
\[ 54 \div 3 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many seats the students took. We subtract the seats the parents took from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats} \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

2. Next, we need to know how many poles are at one intersection. There are 6 poles at each intersection.
3. So, to find out how many street lights are at one intersection, we multiply the number of street lights on one pole by the number of poles at one intersection:
   \[
   4 \text{ street lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles/intersection} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection}
   \]
4. Now, we need to know how many intersections there are. There are 4 intersections.
5. To find out how many street lights are on all the intersections, we multiply the number of street lights at one intersection by the number of intersections:
   \[
   24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights}

We have two DVDs, and each one can be played 1000 times before it breaks. 

The first DVD has already been played 356 times. So, to find out how many more times it can be played, we subtract the number of times it has been played from the total number of times it can be played:
1000 - 356 = 644

The second DVD has been played 135 times. So, to find out how many more times it can be played, we do the same thing:
1000 - 135 = 865

Now, to find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining plays of both DVDs together:

3. Each session lasted 2 hours.
4. The cost of each hour of therapy is $125.

First, let's find out how many sessions John had:
- He went twice a week for 6 weeks.
- So, 6 weeks * 2 sessions per week = 12 sessions.

Next, let's find out how many hours he spent in therapy:
- Each session was 2 hours long.
- So, 12 sessions * 2 hours per session = 24 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- The cost per hour is $125.
- So, 24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000.

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much money James made from selling the cars. He sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000. So, we multiply the number of cars by the price of each car:
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid to get these cars. The company paid 30% of the price of each car to get them. So, we calculate 30% of $25,000:
30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500

Since the company bought 10 cars, we multiply the cost per car by the number of cars:
10 cars * $7,500 = $75,000

Now, we need to find out how much profit the company made. The profit is the total money from selling the cars minus the money the company spent to get the cars:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, we calculate 10% of $175,000:
10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500.

Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. We need to find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob.

First, let's figure out how much faster Tom is going compared to Bob:
- Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
- Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Difference in speed: 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour

This means Tom is catching up to Bob at a speed of 15 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75-mile gap. We can use a simple formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time it takes for Tom to catch up is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Now, if Manny misses some classes, the cost per class goes up. We need to find out how many he can miss before it goes over $10 per class.

If he misses 1 class, he goes to 9 classes:
\[ \frac{60}{9} \approx 6.67 \text{ dollars per class} \]

If he misses 2 classes, he goes to 8 classes:
\[ \frac{60}{8} = 7.50 \text{ dollars per class} \]

If he misses 3 classes, he goes to 7 classes:
\[ \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \text{ dollars per class} \]

If he misses 4 classes, he goes to 6 classes:
\[ \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ dollars per class} \]

If he misses 5 classes, he goes to 5 classes:
\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \text{ dollars per class} \]

So, if he misses 5 classes, each class costs more than $10. Therefore, he can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class goes over $10.

Now, Julie works twice as fast as Jewel. So, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

To find out how many customers Julie processes in a week, we multiply:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To get the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week, we add their weekly totals:

5. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add all these together:

- Base price: $30,000
- King cab: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Exterior light package: $1,500

Total cost: $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

1. **Tim's old salary:**
   - Tim used to make $20,000 each month.

2. **Tim's raise:**
   - He got a 5% raise. To find out how much that is, we need to multiply $20,000 by 5% (which is the same as 0.05).
   - So, $20,000 × 0.05 = $1,000.

3. **Tim's new salary:**
   - Now, we add the raise to his old salary.
   - $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.
   - So, Tim now makes $21,000 each month.

4. **Tim's bonus:**
   - He also gets a bonus that is half of his new monthly salary.
   - Half of $21,000 is $21,000 ÷ 2 = $10,500.

5. **Tim's total earnings in a year:**
   - First, we calculate how much he makes in a year from his new monthly salary.
   - $21,000 × 12 months = $252,000.
   - Then, we add the bonus to this amount.
   - $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500.

So, Tim will make **$262,500** in a year.

**Final Answer:**
262500"
"Okay, let's figure out how much James spent on all his new clothes.

First, we need to find out how much the suits cost. James bought 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, we multiply:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]
So, the suits cost $7500.

Next, we need to find out how much the dress pants cost. Each pair of dress pants costs 1/5 of what a suit costs. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
Each pair of dress pants costs $150. James bought 10 pairs, so we multiply:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]
So, the dress pants cost $1500.

Now, let's figure out the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts for each suit. Since he bought 10 suits, he bought:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so we multiply:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]
So, the dress shirts cost $1800.

Finally, we add up all the costs:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost of everything is $10800.

10800"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how many articles the news website publishes in February. The news website publishes 20 articles every day. Since February has 28 days, we can find the total by multiplying:

20 articles/day × 28 days = 560 articles

Next, we need to find out how many articles the sister company publishes in February. The sister company publishes 10 articles every day. So, we multiply:

10 articles/day × 28 days = 280 articles

Now, to find the total number of articles published by both websites together, we add the two totals:

560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

So, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is:
840"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 ÷ 2 = 32 years old.
4. The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

29"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. So, to find out how much flour is in one bag, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, we have three bags of flour. To find out how much flour is in all three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags:

\[ 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags is:

48 kilograms"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how far Alisa biked. Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
- 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, we need to find out how far Stanley biked. Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Again, we multiply the speed by the time:
- 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance they both biked:
- 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

So, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles.

79"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet every hour. He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil. So, we divide 24 feet by 4 feet per hour:
\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes Bill to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which means he can dig 2 feet every hour. He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay. So, we divide 8 feet by 2 feet per hour:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

Howie wants to give cupcakes to everyone in his class, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. He wants to give each person 2 cupcakes, one vanilla and one chocolate.

First, let's count how many people will get cupcakes:
- Howie: 1
- His teacher: 1
- His classmates: 25

So, the total number of people is:
1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people

Next, we need to figure out how many cupcakes each person will get. Each person gets 2 cupcakes.

So, the total number of cupcakes is:
27 people × 2 cupcakes per person = 54 cupcakes

Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. Fishio got 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week.
2. Three weeks later, she had 70 times as many likes as she had after 1 week. So, we need to multiply 2000 by 70:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. Recently, she got 20000 more likes. So, we need to add 20000 to the 140000 likes she already had:
   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

So, the total number of likes Fishio has now is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

1. Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
   - So, 20 pomegranates × $20 = $400.
2. She had a voucher that gave her $2 off.
   - So, $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, we need to find out how much Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

1. The price of each pomegranate went up to $30.
   - So, 20 pomegranates × $30 = $600.
2. The store gave a 10% discount on the total cost.
   - 10% of $600 is $60.
   - So, $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Clara paid and what Sheila paid.

- Sheila paid $540.
- Clara paid $398.
- The difference is $540 - $398 = $142.

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First, we need to find out how much Ariadne made from green hats.**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half of what she made from green hats.
   - So, if $400 is half, then the full amount from green hats is $400 times 2.
   - \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \)

2. **Next, we add the sales from red and green hats to find the total sales for the first month.**
   - Red hats: $400
   - Green hats: $800
   - Total for the first month: \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \)

3. **Now, we need to find out how much she made in the second month.**
   - In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales from the first month.
   - So, we take the total sales from the first month, which is $1200, and multiply it by \(\frac{3}{4}\).
   - \( 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \)

4. **Finally, we add the sales from both months to get the total amount she made.**
   - First month: $1200
   - Second month: $900
   - Total for both months: \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \)

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

1. **Total Time:**
   - James used the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours.

2. **Free Hour:**
   - He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

3. **Costs:**
   - The first hour costs $15.
   - The second hour costs twice as much as the first hour, so it's \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.
   - The third hour costs twice as much as the second hour, so it's \(30 \times 2 = 60\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves all the guests will eat. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests:
   \[
   3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves}
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many whole eggs are needed. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves:
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Mike has to read a book that has 200 pages. His teacher gave him 30 days to finish it. Mike plans to read 10 pages every day.

First, we need to find out how many days it will take Mike to read the whole book. We do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day:

200 pages ÷ 10 pages/day = 20 days

So, it will take Mike 20 days to finish the book.

Now, we need to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish. We do this by subtracting the number of days it takes him to read the book from the total number of days he has:

30 days - 20 days = 10 days

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to know how much the plane costs. The plane costs $150,000.

Next, we need to figure out how much James pays each month to keep the plane in a hanger. He pays $5,000 every month for the hanger.

Then, we need to find out how much he spends on fuel each month. He spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger. So, he spends $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel each month.

Now, let's add the hanger cost and the fuel cost to find out how much he spends each month to keep the plane running:
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 per month.

To find out how much he spends in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000 for the year.

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost to find the total cost for the first year:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000.

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

   \]
   Then, we find half of that time for beans:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}

Next, we need to find out how much 1/3 pound of walnuts costs. Since 1 pound of walnuts costs $15, one-third of a pound would cost:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much 1/5 pound of almonds costs. Since 1 pound of almonds costs $10, one-fifth of a pound would cost:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for 1/3 pound of walnuts is the same as before:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We know that Lee has sheep and geese on his farm. Each animal has one head, so if there are 20 heads, that means there are 20 animals in total.

Now, let's think about the legs. Sheep have 4 legs each, and geese have 2 legs each. We know that all the animals together have 70 legs.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many sheep there are:

1. If all 20 animals were geese, they would have 20 * 2 = 40 legs.
2. But we know there are 70 legs in total, so the extra legs must be from the sheep.
3. Each sheep has 2 extra legs compared to a goose (4 legs - 2 legs = 2 extra legs).
4. So, the number of extra legs is 70 - 40 = 30 legs.
5. Since each sheep adds 2 extra legs, the number of sheep is 30 / 2 = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

- 1 bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, let's add up what he spent on these items:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00, so the cost of the apple pie is:

Next, the class runs for 6 weeks. So, the total number of hours John spends in the class over 6 weeks is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Now, John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by the time it takes to learn one recipe:
\[ 48 \text{ hours} \div 1.5 \text{ hours/recipe} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know there are 150 teachers on the school basketball court. Out of these, 60% are history teachers. To find out how many history teachers there are, we can do this:

150 teachers × 60% = 150 × 0.60 = 90 history teachers

Now, if there are 150 teachers in total and 90 of them are history teachers, the rest must be math teachers. So, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

150 teachers - 90 history teachers = 60 math teachers

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours all the math teachers sleep together in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours they sleep:

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. The problem says that 30% of the management employees do this.

To find 30% of 10, we can do:

- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Last 6 days**: We need to figure these out.

The next three days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good.

So, the last 6 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

But we know Christina had 12 good days in total. So, the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

So, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Janey has 21 books. The problem says that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. So, if we take away 3 from Janey's books, we can find out how many books Sally has, but we need to divide by 2 because it's twice the number.

First, we take away 3 from 21:
21 - 3 = 18

Now, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many books Sally has:
18 ÷ 2 = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. First, we need to know how tall the bamboo is right now. The problem says it's 20 feet tall. But we need to change this to inches because the final height we want is in inches. We know that 1 foot is the same as 12 inches. So, 20 feet is:
   \[
   20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Next, we want to know how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We can find this by subtracting the current height from the desired height:
   \[
   600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the growth per day:
   \[
   360 \text{ inches} \div 30 \text{ inches/day} = 12 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. That's good, he has enough for now.
2. Then, 8 more dogs come to the shelter. So, he needs 8 more toys to have one for each dog. Now he has 12 dogs and 12 toys.
3. After buying the toys, he goes back and finds out there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, if he left with 12 dogs, now there are 24 dogs. He needs 12 more toys to have one for each of the 24 dogs.
4. When he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone. So, now there are 21 dogs. He needs to make sure he has 21 toys.

Let's add up all the toys:
- He started with 4 toys.
- He bought 8 toys for the 8 new dogs.
- He bought 12 more toys for the extra 12 dogs.
- He doesn't need 3 toys because 3 dogs are gone.

So, the total number of toys he needs is:
4 + 8 + 12 - 3 = 21

James needs 21 toys in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know that three people put money into a savings account, and the total amount is $1200.

Dylan put in 2/5 of the total amount. To find out how much that is, we do:
\[ \text{Dylan's part} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

So, Dylan put in $480.

Now, we need to find out how much money is left after Dylan's part:
\[ \text{Money left} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances put in 2/3 of the remaining money. To find out how much that is, we do:
\[ \text{Frances's part} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

So, Frances put in $480.

Finally, we need to find out how much money is left for Skyler:
\[ \text{Skyler's part} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \]

They want to have 100 signatures in total. So, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect:
\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

So, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

Now, Karen works 3 hours each day. So, in one day, she earns:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Since we want to know how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

2. Now, we need to find out how many hash browns 96 potatoes can make:
   - If 1 potato makes 6 hash browns, then 96 potatoes will make \( 96 \times 6 = 576 \) hash browns.

So, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

2. Each adult weighs about 80 kg. So, to find the total weight, we multiply the number of people by the weight of each person:
   \[
   9 \text{ people} \times 80 \text{ kg/person} = 720 \text{ kg}
   \]
3. The elevator can only hold 700 kg. To find out how much they exceed the limit, we subtract the maximum weight the elevator can hold from the total weight of the people:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Shania made her dress longer by adding 50% of its original length and then added 20 cm of lace at the bottom. The final dress is 140 cm long. We need to find out how long the dress was before she made it longer.

1. First, let's call the original length of the dress \( L \).
2. When Shania made the dress 50% longer, she added half of \( L \) to the original length. So the new length is \( L + 0.5L \), which is the same as \( 1.5L \).
3. Then, she added 20 cm of lace to the bottom. So the final length is \( 1.5L + 20 \).
4. We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   1.5L + 20 = 140
   \]
5. To find \( L \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   1.5L = 120
   \]
6. Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[
   L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80

   - Half of 60 minutes is 30 minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the whole lawn in 40 minutes.
   - If he mows half the lawn, it will take him half the time.
   - Half of 40 minutes is 20 minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and half the lawn in rabbit mode.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two sets of kids: one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know two things:
1. One of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets.
2. All their ages together add up to 44.

Let's call the age of one of the triplets ""R"" (for ""Rabbit"" to make it fun). Then, the age of one of the twins would be ""R + 7"" (because the twin is 7 years older).

Now, we have two twins and three triplets. So, the total age of all the kids is:
\[ 2 \times (R + 7) + 3 \times R = 44 \]

Let's break it down:
1. The age of the two twins is \( 2 \times (R + 7) \).
2. The age of the three triplets is \( 3 \times R \).

So, we can write:
\[ 2 \times (R + 7) + 3 \times R = 44 \]

Now, let's solve it step by step:
1. First, expand \( 2 \times (R + 7) \):
   \[ 2R + 14 \]

2. Now, add \( 3R \):
   \[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]

3. Combine like terms:
   \[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]

4. Subtract 14 from both sides:
   \[ 5R = 30 \]

5. Divide both sides by 5:
   \[ R = 6 \]

So, one of the triplets is 6 years old. Now, we need to find the age of one of the twins:
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

Next, we need to know how much time John has before dinner:
- He has 3 hours before dinner.
- 3 hours is the same as 3 x 60 minutes = 180 minutes.

First, we know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. So, let's find out how much the lollipops cost in total:

5 lollipops × $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, we know the total cost of the lollipops is $2.00. So, the cost of the 4 candies must be the rest of the $3.20:

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This means the 4 candies cost $1.20. To find out how much one candy costs, we divide $1.20 by 4:

$1.20 ÷ 4 = $0.30

So, each candy costs $0.30.

Now, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. First, let's calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:

10 lollipops × $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of 10 candies:

10 candies × $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Finally, we add the cost of the lollipops and the candies together:

$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. 

First, let's find out how many more coins Neil saves compared to Rong:
- 2/5 of 20 coins is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) coins.

So, Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong each month. This means Neil saves:
- 20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins each month.

Now, let's find out how many coins each of them saves in one year:
- Rong saves 20 coins/month × 12 months/year = 240 coins/year.
- Neil saves 28 coins/month × 12 months/year = 336 coins/year.

Next, let's find out how many coins they save in ten years:
- Rong saves 240 coins/year × 10 years = 2400 coins.
- Neil saves 336 coins/year × 10 years = 3360 coins.

Finally, let's add the total coins saved by Rong and Neil:

First, we need to figure out how much the vaccines cost. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each one costs $20. So, we do:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
So, the vaccines cost $40.

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of \( T \), which means:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. We can do this by moving the \( 0.60 \times T \) to the other side:
\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 0.40 to find \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

John leaves with $25.

   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - So, 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - So, 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

4. **White Squares:**

1. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds.
3. When Gissela, Gordy, and Gary work together, their trucks can carry a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Now, let's add up what Gissela and Gordy can carry together:
4,000 pounds (Gissela) + 4,800 pounds (Gordy) = 8,800 pounds.

To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to see how much more is needed to reach 11,600 pounds:
11,600 pounds (total) - 8,800 pounds (Gissela and Gordy) = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. There are 6 females, so we can find out how many dumplings the females ate by multiplying:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
There are 8 males, so we can find out how many dumplings the males ate by multiplying:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Now, to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, Larry cooked:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to figure out how much money Gerald and Julia each got. They divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

1. We add the parts together: 3 + 2 = 5 parts
2. Each part is worth: $100 ÷ 5 = $20
3. Gerald's share is: 3 parts × $20 = $60
4. Julia's share is: 2 parts × $20 = $40

Now, Gerald spent $10 on a book. We need to find out how much money he has left.

5. Gerald's money left: $60 - $10 = $50

So, Gerald has $50 left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that Martha's cat can run 15 feet every second. The problem says the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. So, to find out how fast the turtle goes, we divide the cat's speed by 5:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can go in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **First, we need to find out how much money they make each hour:**
   - They raised $2100 in 3 hours.
   - So, to find out how much they make each hour, we divide $2100 by 3:
     \[
     2100 \div 3 = 700
     \]
   - This means they make $700 each hour.

2. **Next, we need to find out how much more money they need to reach their goal:**
   - Their goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - So, we subtract $2100 from $6300 to find out how much more they need:
     \[
     6300 - 2100 = 4200
     \]
   - They need $4200 more.

3. **Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to get the $4200:**
   - They make $700 each hour.
   - To find out how many hours they need, we divide $4200 by $700:
     \[
     4200 \div 700 = 6
     \]
   - They need 6 more hours to raise the remaining $4200.

4. **Finally, we add the hours they have already fundraised to the hours they still need:**
   - They have already fundraised for 3 hours.
   - They need 6 more hours.
   - So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:
     \[
     3 + 6 = 9

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that the city uses 40% of the water from the river. That means for every 100 parts of water in the river, the city takes 40 parts.

Next, we're told that 80% of the water the city takes is used for industrial stuff. So, out of the 40 parts the city takes, 80% is used for industries. To find out how much that is, we can do a simple multiplication:

40 parts × 80% = 40 × 0.80 = 32 parts

So, 32 parts out of the 40 parts are used for industries.

Now, to find out how much water is used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial water from the total water the city uses:

40 parts - 32 parts = 8 parts

So, the city uses 8 parts of the river's water for non-industrial purposes. 

To find out what percent this is of the total river water, we remember that the total river water is 100 parts. So, 8 parts out of 100 parts is:

8%

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

8%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many days are in 2 weeks. Since 1 week has 7 days, 2 weeks will have:
   - 7 days + 7 days = 14 days

2. Now, Alex charges $12 for each day of tutoring. So, for 14 days, we need to multiply 14 by 12:
   - 14 days * $12/day = $168

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in school!

First, we need to figure out how much chocolate ice cream the factory can make in one hour. The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. So, if we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours, we get:
\[ 100 \div 2 = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much vanilla ice cream the factory can make in one hour. The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. So, if we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours, we get:
\[ 50 \div 4 = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Now, we want to know how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours. 

For chocolate ice cream:
\[ 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \]

For vanilla ice cream:
\[ 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total:
\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

So, the factory would make 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Marcus has to pay for all the yummy treats he bought!

First, we need to find out how much each type of treat costs:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3 each, so 5 times 3 is $15.
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, so 4 times 2.50 is $10.
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4 each, so 3 times 4 is $12.
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1 each, so 13 times 1 is $13.

Now, let's add all these costs together to find the total before the discount:

$15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find out how much the discount is, we need to calculate 10% of $50:

10% of $50 is $5.

So, we subtract the discount from the total:

$50 - $5 = $45

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. 

The ice cream parlor has a deal: if you buy 2 scoops, you get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00. We need to figure out how many scoops she can get.

First, let's see how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00 without thinking about the free scoops:
- Each scoop costs $1.50.
- So, $6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops.

But remember, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) she can get with her $6.00:
- Each set of 3 scoops costs $1.50 × 2 = $3.00.
- So, $6.00 ÷ $3.00 = 2 sets.

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
- 2 sets × 3 scoops per set = 6 scoops.

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with her $6.00.

1. **First, we need to know how many days are in two weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 2 weeks have 7 days/week × 2 weeks = 14 days.

2. **Next, let's see how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:**
   - Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day.
   - So, in 14 days, Ginger eats 4 pieces/day × 14 days = 56 pieces.

3. **Now, let's see how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:**
   - Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day.
   - So, in 14 days, Amy eats 3 pieces/day × 14 days = 42 pieces.

4. **Let's find out how much candy Ginger has left:**
   - Ginger started with 100 pieces.
   - After eating 56 pieces, Ginger has 100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left.

5. **Let's find out how much candy Amy has left:**
   - Amy started with 100 pieces.
   - After eating 42 pieces, Amy has 100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left.

6. **Finally, let's see how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:**
   - Amy has 58 pieces.
   - Ginger has 44 pieces.
   - So, Amy has 58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces more than Ginger.

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. First, we need to find out how much it costs James to pick the blueberries.
   - It costs $20 just to go picking.
   - Then, it costs $1.5 for each pound of blueberries he picks.
   - James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

   So, the cost for the blueberries he picked is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45
   \]

   Adding the cost to go picking:
   \[
   \$20 + \$45 = \$65
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much it would cost James to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store.
   - The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound.
   - James needs 30 pounds of blueberries.

   So, the cost at the store is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75

1. **Eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the eggs are \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

2. **Cheese:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
   - Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the cheese are \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

3. **Ham:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of ham (the same as the cheese).
   - Each ounce of ham has 40 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the ham are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, we add up all the calories:
- Calories from eggs: 450
- Calories from cheese: 240
- Calories from ham: 80

Total calories in the omelet: \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

Helga is a really fast clog dancer. She can tap her right foot 300 times in one minute and her left foot 250 times in one minute when her arms are at her sides. But when she raises her arms, she slows down and taps each foot 200 times in one minute.

She dances for a total of 5 minutes, but she only raises her arms for 2 of those minutes. We need to find out how many times she taps both of her feet in total.

First, let's figure out how many times she taps her feet when her arms are at her sides:
- She dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes.
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute × 3 minutes = 900 taps
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute × 3 minutes = 750 taps

Next, let's figure out how many times she taps her feet when her arms are raised:
- She dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.
- Right foot: 200 taps per minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps

Now, let's add up all the taps:
- Total right foot taps: 900 taps + 400 taps = 1300 taps
- Total left foot taps: 750 taps + 400 taps = 1150 taps

Ron has a big hole in the road in front of his house. If he doesn't fix it, it might hurt his car and cost him $450 to fix the car. But if he fixes the hole himself, the city will fine him $120 for doing it without permission. He also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt to fix the hole, and each bucket costs $25.

First, let's find out how much the asphalt costs:
- 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each:
  \[
  3 \times 25 = 75
  \]

Now, let's add the fine and the cost of the asphalt to find out the total cost if Ron fixes the hole:
- Fine: $120
- Asphalt: $75
  \[
  120 + 75 = 195
  \]

So, if Ron fixes the hole himself, it will cost him $195. If he doesn't fix it, it will cost him $450 to fix his car.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the hole himself, we subtract the cost of fixing the hole from the cost of fixing the car:
\[
450 - 195 = 255

   - Bryce and his four friends each got a pizza.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - So, 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices in total.

2. **Slices Eaten by Bryce and Two Friends:**
   - Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - 2/3 of 12 slices = 8 slices per person.
   - So, 3 people * 8 slices per person = 24 slices eaten.

3. **Slices Eaten by the Other Two Friends:**
   - The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - 3/4 of 12 slices = 9 slices per person.
   - So, 2 people * 9 slices per person = 18 slices eaten.

4. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten by all friends = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (other two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices Left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

First, we know that the cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. That's easy to remember!

Next, the dog eats the same number of sausages, but it does it faster. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes. So, we need to find out what 2/3 of 30 minutes is.

To find 2/3 of 30 minutes:
1. First, we divide 30 by 3: \( 30 \div 3 = 10 \)
2. Then, we multiply 10 by 2: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

So, the dog takes 20 minutes to eat nine sausages.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2.

1. Add the times: \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Next, we know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe \( x \) inches. According to the problem:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows per car = 256 windows.
- Hannah smashed a quarter of these windows. A quarter means 1/4.
- So, the number of windows smashed in the students' cars is 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, we need to find out how many windows Hannah smashed in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows per car = 64 windows.
- Hannah smashed 3/4 of these windows. Three-quarters means 3/4.
- So, the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars is 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Then, we multiply by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we start with 5000 people at 8:00. By midday, 2 out of every 5 people had voted. So, we need to find out how many that is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]
So, 2000 people had voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people were left who hadn't voted yet:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]
So, 3000 people hadn't voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2 out of every 3 of these remaining people had voted. So, we need to find out how many that is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]
So, 2000 more people had voted by 16:00.

Now, we need to find out how many people were left who hadn't voted by 16:00:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days. He chews 4 pieces every day, so we multiply 4 by 30:
\[ 4 \times 30 = 120 \]
So, Parker will chew 120 pieces of gum in 30 days.

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum he needs. Each pack has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each pack:
\[ 120 \div 15 = 8 \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to know how many smores everyone wants:
- 9 kids want 2 smores each. So, 9 kids * 2 smores = 18 smores.
- 6 adults want 1 smore each. So, 6 adults * 1 smore = 6 smores.

Now, let's add these together to find out how many smores we need in total:
- 18 smores (for kids) + 6 smores (for adults) = 24 smores.

Next, we need to figure out how many sleeves of graham crackers we need:
- Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
- To make 24 smores, we need 24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Finally, we need to know how many boxes of graham crackers we need:
- Each box has 3 sleeves.
- We need 3 sleeves, so we need 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

So, we need 1 box of graham crackers.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Dora is 15 years old. Her dad's age is eight more than twice her age. So, we need to do this:

1. First, find twice Dora's age: \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \).
2. Then, add 8 to that: \( 30 + 8 = 38 \).

So, Dora's dad is 38 years old.

Next, Dora's mom is four years younger than her dad. So, we do this:

1. Subtract 4 from Dora's dad's age: \( 38 - 4 = 34 \).

So, Dora's mom is 34 years old.

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her dad, and her mom. We add their ages together:

1. Dora's age: 15
2. Dora's dad's age: 38
3. Dora's mom's age: 34

So, \( 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \).

The total combined age of Dora, her dad, and her mom is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Cindy has a math book and a science book, and each one weighs 2 pounds. So, the total weight for both books is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Her French book weighs 4 pounds.

3. Her English book weighs 3 pounds.

4. Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, her history book weighs:
   \[
   2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the weights:
\[
4 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. First, we know that candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there are 100 voters, we can find out how many votes that is:
   - 20% of 100 = 20 votes for candidate A.

2. Next, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we need to find out what 50% more than 20 votes is:
   - 50% of 20 = 10 votes.
   - So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. We already counted the votes for candidates A and B:
   - Votes for A = 20
   - Votes for B = 30
   - Total votes for A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

4. To find out how many votes candidate C got, we subtract the votes for A and B from the total number of votes:
   - Votes for C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

4. After receiving 10 apples, Beck has:
   \[
   77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to know how much water Peter uses for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - So, for the giant cubes, he uses \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces of water.

2. **Medium cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - So, for the medium cubes, he uses \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces of water.

3. **Small cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - So, for the small cubes, he uses \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces of water.

Now, let's add up all the water he used:
- Total water used = \( 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \) ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, to find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
- Water left = \( 32 - 30 = 2 \) ounces.

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that Clara has 20 books. The problem says that Clara has two times as many books as Steven. So, if we divide Clara's books by 2, we can find out how many books Steven has:
\[ 20 \div 2 = 10 \]
So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, the problem tells us that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. If Steven has 10 books, then Alice has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]
So, Alice has 16 books.

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We do this by subtracting the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5. The problem also tells us that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, if we take away $2 from the cost of a gallon jar, we can find out how much a half-gallon jar costs:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]
So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to find out how much Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, we multiply the number of gallon jars by the cost of each:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
So, she spent $50 on gallon jars.

Now, we need to find out how much she spent on 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, we multiply the number of half-gallon jars by the cost of each:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]
So, she spent $48 on half-gallon jars.

Finally, to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together:
\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

First, we know there are 50 students in the class. That's a lot of friends!

Now, let's count how many students have different hobbies:
- 10 students like to bake. Yummy!
- 5 students like to play basketball. That's a fun sport!
- The rest of the students like to play video games or play music.

The problem says that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like basketball, then:
- 2 times 5 is 10. So, 10 students like to play music.

Now, let's add up the students we know about:
- 10 students like to bake.
- 5 students like to play basketball.
- 10 students like to play music.

That's 10 + 5 + 10 = 25 students.

So, the rest of the students must like to play video games. We started with 50 students, and we've counted 25 so far. So:
- 50 - 25 = 25 students like to play video games.

The answer is 25."

So, 4 birds flew away. Now, we need to find out how many birds are left:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

After that, 20 more birds came to join the ones that stayed. So, we add 20 to the 8 birds that were left:

- Horses: 12

Now, let's add them all together:
8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Melissa has 28 animals to take care of in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we need to divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals she will take care of each day.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jake's family can save by going to the second amusement park instead of the first one.

First, we need to find out how much it costs for the family to go to each park.

For the first amusement park:
- Each adult costs $26, and there are 2 adults, so that's \(26 \times 2 = 52\) dollars.
- Each child costs $12, and there are 2 children, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the first park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

For the second amusement park:
- Each adult costs $14, and there are 2 adults, so that's \(14 \times 2 = 28\) dollars.
- Each child costs $10, and there are 2 children, so that's \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the second park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much they save by choosing the second park:
- The cost of the first park is $76.
- The cost of the second park is $48.

First, we need to find out how much the tomato vendor used to spend on tomatoes each day. He bought 500 tomatoes, and each tomato cost him 50 cents. So, we do:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes} \times 50 \text{ cents} = 25000 \text{ cents} \]
Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 25000 cents to dollars:
\[ 25000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he spends now with the new vendor. The new vendor sells each tomato for 40 cents. So, we do:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes} \times 40 \text{ cents} = 20000 \text{ cents} \]
Again, converting 20000 cents to dollars:
\[ 20000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find out how much he saves each day by subtracting the new cost from the old cost:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 200 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much he saves in a week, we multiply the daily savings by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the vendor saves 350 dollars a week.

\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \]
So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have together. We add Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles:

- 4 weeks have 4 x 7 = 28 days.
- Two 4-week months have 2 x 28 = 56 days.

Next, we need to know how many of these days are weekdays and how many are weekends. Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days, so:
- In 4 weeks, there are 4 x 5 = 20 weekdays.
- In 4 weeks, there are 4 x 2 = 8 weekend days.
- In two 4-week months, there are 2 x 20 = 40 weekdays.
- In two 4-week months, there are 2 x 8 = 16 weekend days.

Now, we know that Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday and 100 chairs each weekend day. So, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented:
- For weekdays: 60 chairs/day x 40 days = 2400 chairs.
- For weekends: 100 chairs/day x 16 days = 1600 chairs.

Finally, we add the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends to get the total:
- Total chairs rented = 2400 + 1600 = 4000 chairs.

So, the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
- 90% of 30 is 27, so she trades 27 small stickers.
- Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
- 50% of 40 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers.
- Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 20 large stickers left. She trades these for small buttons.
- Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers give her 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Let's add up all the buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from trading small stickers) + 60 (from trading large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20 large buttons

Each large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Finally, we add the small buttons together:
- 87 small buttons + 60 small buttons = 147 small buttons

So, Lorraine has 147 buttons by the end.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

We know that the council has 33 people. The problem says that the number of people who voted for the new rule is twice the number of people who voted against it.

Let's use simple numbers to understand this better. If we say that the number of people who voted against the rule is \( A \), then the number of people who voted for the rule is \( 2A \).

Now, we know that the total number of people is 33, so we can write this as:
\[ A + 2A = 33 \]

This means:
\[ 3A = 33 \]

To find \( A \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 11 \]

So, 11 people voted against the rule. Since the number of people who voted for the rule is twice that, we have:
\[ 2A = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - So, 18 divided by 2 is 9 students.

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - So, 9 plus 6 is 15 students.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The bag is 5% off, and it costs $140.
2. To find 5% of $140, we can multiply 140 by 0.05 (which is the same as 5%):
   \[
   140 \times 0.05 = 7
   \]
   So, the discount is $7.
3. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much we will pay:
   \[
   140 - 7 = 133
   \]

So, after the discount, you will pay $133.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how many songs are in all 20 playlists together. If one playlist has 300 songs, then 20 playlists will have:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long all these songs will play. If each song is 10 hours long, then 6000 songs will play for:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the 20 playlists will last for a total of 60000 hours.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win. We know that 20% of 50 people think this. To find 20% of 50, we can do:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]
So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left. We started with 50 people, and 10 of them think horse #2 will win. So, the number of people left is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. We know that 60% of the remaining 40 people think this. To find 60% of 40, we can do:
\[ 60\% \times 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24 \]
So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, we need to find out how many people are left who think horse #12 will win. We started with 40 people, and 24 of them think horse #7 will win. So, the number of people left is:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that 6 of Jana's Pomeranians are girls.
2. The problem says that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. So, if 6 is one third, then the total number of Pomeranians must be 3 times 6. That's 18 Pomeranians.
3. Now, the problem also tells us that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 Pomeranians are two thirds of all the puppies, then we need to find out how many puppies there are in total.
4. To find the total number of puppies, we can think of it like this: if 18 is two thirds, then one third would be half of 18, which is 9. So, the total number of puppies is 3 times 9, which is 27.

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class.

We have three houses that need new roofs. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.

1. The first house needs half as many cases as the second house.
2. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house.

Let's use a simple letter to represent the number of cases for the first house. We'll call it \( x \).

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (because it's double the first house).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (because it's double the first house).

Now, we add up all the cases for the three houses:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. 

The third house needs double the first house, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Leila bought 3 cucumbers, and each cucumber costs $2. So, Leila spent 3 * 2 = $6.
Jack bought 5 tomatoes, and each tomato costs $1. So, Jack spent 5 * 1 = $5.
Chase bought 1 head of lettuce, and it costs $3. So, Chase spent 1 * 3 = $3.

Now, to find out how much they all spent together, we add up what each of them spent:
$6 + $5 + $3 = $14

So, they spent $14 in total to make the salad for the potluck.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know that George has 200 bananas. The problem says he has 45% more pears than bananas. 

To find out how many more pears he has, we need to calculate 45% of 200. 

45% of 200 is:
\[ 45 \div 100 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

Now, to find out how many pears he has, we add 90 to the number of bananas:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Next, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

So, George has 490 fruits in total.

"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. 

First, we need to find out how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs for 4 liters of juice:
- If 1 liter needs 5 kilograms, then 4 liters will need \(5 \times 4 = 20\) kilograms of oranges.

Next, we calculate the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges:
- If 1 kilogram costs $3, then 20 kilograms will cost \(20 \times 3 = 60\) dollars.

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Tanya earned for teaching on Monday and Wednesday.

**Monday:**
- Tanya taught for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- So, for 5 hours, she earns: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) dollars.
- She also taught more than 3 classes, so she gets an extra $5 for the day.
- So, for Monday, she earns: \( 75 + 5 = 80 \) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya taught for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- So, for 2 hours, she earns: \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) dollars.
- She taught only 2 classes, so she doesn't get the extra $5 for the day.
- So, for Wednesday, she earns: \( 30 \) dollars.

**Total for both days:**
- Monday: 80 dollars
- Wednesday: 30 dollars
- Total: \( 80 + 30 = 110 \) dollars

So, Tanya earned 110 dollars for these two days of teaching.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

The perfume company has two types of scents: vanilla and fruity. They want to see which one sells more.

- They have 4 different vanilla scents, and they sell 5 of each vanilla scent.
- They have 8 different fruity scents, and they sell 2 of each fruity scent.

First, let's find out how many vanilla scents they sold in total:
- 4 vanilla scents × 5 sold each = 20 vanilla scents sold.

Next, let's find out how many fruity scents they sold in total:
- 8 fruity scents × 2 sold each = 16 fruity scents sold.

Now, we need to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents:
- 20 vanilla scents sold - 16 fruity scents sold = 4 more vanilla scents sold.

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants, and each one costs $3. So, we do:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Next, we need to figure out how much more money he needs to make to reach his goal of $135. We subtract the money he already made from his goal:

\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 more from selling his 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs by the number of ears of corn:

   \]

2. Next, we know she reads for 3 hours. We need to subtract this from the total time to find out how much time is left:
   \[
   12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. To find out how much time that is, we divide the remaining time by 3:
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. After playing video games, we need to find out how much time is left for playing soccer. We subtract the video game time from the remaining time:
   \[
   9 - 3 = 6 \text{ hours}

1. Anthony had 50 pencils.
2. He gave half of his pencils to Brandon. Half of 50 is 25, so he gave 25 pencils to Brandon.
3. Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
4. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils that is, we need to calculate 3/5 of 25. 
   - First, we find 1/5 of 25: 25 ÷ 5 = 5.
   - Then, we multiply that by 3: 5 × 3 = 15.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **How long does it take Jack to drive to the museum?**
   - The museum is 150 miles away.
   - Jack drives at 75 miles per hour.
   - To find out how long it takes, we divide the distance by the speed:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **How long does it take Jack to drive back home?**
   - The distance is the same, 150 miles.
   - The speed is the same, 75 miles per hour.
   - So, it takes another 2 hours to drive back.

3. **How long does Jack spend at the museum?**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

4. **How long is Jack gone from home in total?**
   - He spends 2 hours driving to the museum.

First, we need to find out how many wheels Henry needs for the cars:
- Each car needs 4 wheels.
- Henry has 57 cars.
- So, for the cars, he needs 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.

Next, we need to find out how many wheels Henry needs for the motorcycles:
- Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels.
- Henry has 73 motorcycles.
- So, for the motorcycles, he needs 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, let's add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles:
- Total wheels needed = 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total wheels needed from the wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

So, the number of wheels left is 276.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. If a laptop costs $1000 and you get a 20% discount, that means you save 20 out of every 100 dollars. 

First, we need to find out how much 20% of $1000 is:
- 20% of $1000 is the same as 20/100 * $1000.
- 20/100 is the same as 0.20.
- So, 0.20 * $1000 = $200.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:
- $1000 - $200 = $800.

So, after the discount, you have to pay $800 for the laptop.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a big puzzle!

1. **Total Movies**: Mike has 600 movies.

2. **Movies in Series**:
   - One-third of the movies are in series.
   - One-third of 600 is \( 600 \div 3 = 200 \) movies.
   - These series movies cost only $6 each.
   - So, the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Remaining Movies**:
   - After taking out the series movies, we have \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies left.
   - Forty percent of these remaining movies are older movies.
   - Forty percent of 400 is \( 400 \times 0.4 = 160 \) movies.
   - Older movies cost $5 each.
   - So, the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

4. **Newer Movies**:
   - The rest of the movies are newer movies.
   - The number of newer movies is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.
   - Newer movies cost $10 each.
   - So, the total cost for the newer movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we add up all the costs:
   - Series movies: $1200
   - Older movies: $800
   - Newer movies: $2400

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much Winston spent on each type of fruit:

1. **Peaches:**
   - He picked 6 pounds of peaches.
   - Peaches cost $2.00 per pound.
   - So, the cost for peaches is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

2. **Plums:**
   - He picked 8 pounds of plums.
   - Plums cost $1.00 per pound.
   - So, the cost for plums is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) dollars.

3. **Apricots:**
   - He picked 6 pounds of apricots.
   - Apricots cost $3.00 per pound.
   - So, the cost for apricots is \(6 \times 3 = 18\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Winston spent:

- Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
- Total cost = 12 + 8 + 18

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Driving Time and Speed:**
   - The Llesis family drove for 6 hours in total.
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - They drove at a speed of 50 miles per hour.

2. **Driving Distance:**
   - To find out how far they drove, we multiply the time they drove by their speed.
   - So, \(4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Hiking Speed:**
   - They hiked at a speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of 50 miles per hour is \(50 \div 2 = 25\) miles per hour.
   - So, their hiking speed was \(25 - 5 = 20\) miles per hour.

4. **Hiking Distance:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - To find out how far they hiked, we multiply the time they hiked by their hiking speed.
   - So, \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

5. **Total Distance:**
   - To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance.

   - Points for enemies: Emma gets \( 10E \) points, and Ava gets \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \) points.

2. **Berries:**
   - Emma collects \( B \) berries.
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points for berries: Emma gets \( 5B \) points, and Ava gets \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \) points.

3. **Timer:**
   - Emma finishes with \( T \) seconds left.
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points for timer: Emma gets \( 30T \) points, and Ava gets \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \) points.

4. **Total Scores:**
   - Emma's total score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
   - Ava's total score: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \)

5. **Simplify Ava's Total Score:**
   - Combine like terms: \( 10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

6. **Difference in Scores:**

- 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

Next, on 2 other days, they ride their bikes twice as much as they do on the usual days. So, on these special days, they ride:
- 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day
- 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the special days to find the total number of rides in a week:
- 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Bob started with 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He went to the pet store and got 17 more fish. We don't know how many of these were orange and how many were white, but we need to find out how many white fish he got.
3. After adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's use some simple math to figure this out:

- Let's say Bob bought \( x \) white fish and \( y \) orange fish.
- We know that \( x + y = 17 \) because he bought 17 fish in total.
- After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
- After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2 \times (4 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, simplify the equation:
   \[ 3 + y = 2 \times (4 + x) \]
   \[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
   \[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
   \[ y = 5 + 2x \]

2. Now, we know that \( x + y = 17 \). Substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into this equation:
   \[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
   \[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
   \[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
   \[ 3x = 12 \]
   \[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To check:
- If Bob bought 4 white fish, then he bought \( 5 + 2 \times 4 = 5 + 8 = 13 \) orange fish.
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

First, we need to know how far Andy drives each day. He drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home. So, each day he drives:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} + 5 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he drives in a week. He drives to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, in a week, he drives:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to know how much gas his car uses. His car uses 1 gallon of gas for every 10 miles. So, for 50 miles, he uses:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much money he spends on gas. The price of gas is $3 per gallon. So, for 5 gallons, he spends:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes Ricardo gets from his tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- So, 22 tomatoes per plant times 5 plants equals 110 tomatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many eggplants Ricardo gets from his eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, 4 eggplants per plant times 8 plants equals 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the tomatoes and eggplants together to find the total number of fruits:
- 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that Samwell's store sold 40 TVs in total. Out of these, one-fourth are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. We need to find out how many are OLED TVs.

1. **Find the number of smart TVs:**
   - One-fourth of 40 is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).
   - So, 10 TVs are smart TVs.

2. **Find the number of analog TVs:**
   - One-eighth of 40 is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \).
   - So, 5 TVs are analog TVs.

3. **Find the number of OLED TVs:**
   - We know the total number of TVs is 40.
   - We already found that 10 are smart TVs and 5 are analog TVs.
   - So, the number of OLED TVs is \( 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \).

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Find out how cold it gets at night:**
   - During the day, it's 45 degrees.
   - At night, it's 33 degrees colder.
   - So, we need to subtract 33 from 45 to find the night temperature.
   - 45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.

2. **Figure out how much warmer we need to make it:**
   - The pipes will freeze if it gets below 32 degrees.
   - Right now, it's 12 degrees at night.
   - We need to make it warm enough so it doesn't go below 32 degrees.
   - So, we need to add enough heat to get from 12 degrees to 32 degrees.
   - 32 - 12 = 20 degrees warmer.

3. **Calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn:**
   - Each log of wood makes the house 5 degrees warmer.
   - We need to make it 20 degrees warmer.
   - So, we divide 20 by 5 to find out how many logs are needed.
   - 20 ÷ 5 = 4 logs.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many groups there are. We have 90 people, and each group has 9 people. So, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. The problem says that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we need to find \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups had 9 people, and each person brought back 2 seashells. So, we need to find out how many seashells 9 people in one group brought back:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Since 6 groups each brought back 18 seashells, we multiply 18 by 6:

\[ 18 \times 6 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:

108"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we start with 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off. So, we subtract 47 from 172:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]
3. Then, 13 more people get on the train. So, we add 13 to 125:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, we subtract 38 from 138:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many bottle caps Damien finds in one month. He finds 10 bottle caps every day, and there are 30 days in the month. So, we multiply:

10 bottle caps/day × 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Next, we need to find out how much money 300 bottle caps are worth. Each bottle cap is worth 25 cents, which is the same as $0.25. So, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:

300 bottle caps × $0.25/bottle cap = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jamie made last Tuesday.

1. **Regular Work:**
   - Jamie works 8 hours a day at $20 an hour.
   - So, for 8 hours, she makes: 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

2. **Extra Work:**
   - Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so she worked 11 - 8 = 3 extra hours.
   - For the extra hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular rate.
   - 150% of $20 is: 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour.
   - So, for 3 extra hours, she makes: 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. **Total Money:**
   - Now, we add the money from her regular work and the extra work.
   - Total money = $160 + $90 = $250

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work last Tuesday.

1. First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40.
   - To find 25% of $40, we can think of it as 25 out of 100, which is the same as 1 out of 4.
   - So, we divide $40 by 4: 
     \[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]
   - The discount is $10.

2. Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price.
   - The original price is $40, and the discount is $10.
   - So, the sale price is:
     \[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

3. Finally, we need to find out how much money Mike will have left if he pays with a $50 bill.
   - Mike pays $50, and the sale price is $30.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **Initial number of employees**: The company starts with 200 employees.
2. **New employees each month**: The company hires 20 new employees every month.
3. **Number of months**: We need to find out how many employees there are after 3 months.

First, let's find out how many new employees are hired in 3 months:
\[ 20 \text{ new employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ new employees} \]

Now, let's add these new employees to the initial number of employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the company pays all these employees in one month. Each employee gets $4000 per month:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much the company pays all these employees over 3 months:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **Billy's Starting Pay:**
   - Billy started with $10 per hour.

2. **Billy's First Raise:**
   - After 2 months, Billy got a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - So, his new pay is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **Billy's Second Raise:**
   - On his first anniversary, Billy got another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - So, his new pay is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

4. **Sally's Starting Pay:**
   - Sally started with $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting pay.
   - So, Sally's pay is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

5. **Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - Billy earns $11.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, he earns $11.50 × 20 = $230.
   - Sally earns $10.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, she earns $10.50 × 20 = $210.

6. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings.
   - $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

Next, we need to find out how much 2 bagels cost. Each bagel costs $1, so:
\[ 2 \text{ bagels} \times 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the 3 loaves of bread cost compared to the 2 bagels. We do this by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} - 2 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost 4 dollars more than 2 bagels.

1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Now, let's count the teachers. There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers. So, we multiply:

40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so:

120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Finally, we add the trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees:

Bubbles has a bunch of stuffed animals:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

First, let's add up all the stuffed animals she has right now:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Now, Bubbles wants to buy some stuffed goats so that the goats make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. 

To find out how many goats she needs, we need to figure out what 30% of the total number of stuffed animals should be. Let's call the number of goats she needs to buy ""x.""

If she buys x goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x.

We want the goats to be 30% of this total, so:
x = 0.30 × (14 + x)

Now, let's solve this step by step:
1. Multiply 0.30 by 14:
   0.30 × 14 = 4.2

2. So, the equation becomes:
   x = 4.2 + 0.30x

3. To solve for x, we need to get all the x's on one side:
   x - 0.30x = 4.2

4. Combine like terms:
   0.70x = 4.2

5. Divide both sides by 0.70:
   x = 4.2 ÷ 0.70
   x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Kris is trying to get a video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, and then she plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Let's figure out how many hours she still needs to play.

First, we need to find out how many days are in 2 weeks:
- 2 weeks = 14 days

Now, let's calculate how many hours she plays in those 14 days:
- Half an hour each day for 14 days = 0.5 hours/day × 14 days = 7 hours

Next, we need to find out how many days are in 1 week:
- 1 week = 7 days

Now, let's calculate how many hours she plays in those 7 days:
- 2 hours each day for 7 days = 2 hours/day × 7 days = 14 hours

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours she has played so far:
- Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to get the achievement. So, we need to find out how many more hours she needs to play:
- Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

So, Kris still needs to play **9 hours** to earn the achievement.

First, let's figure out how far each car goes in 2 hours.

For the first car:
- It goes 60 miles in 1 hour.
- So in 2 hours, it will go 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles.

For the second car:
- It goes 70 miles in 1 hour.
- So in 2 hours, it will go 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles.

Now, we need to find out how far apart they are after 2 hours. We do this by subtracting the distance the first car traveled from the distance the second car traveled:
- 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

   - So, 340 students passed in third grade.

2. **Fourth Grade:**
   - 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed.
   - So, 40 students passed in fourth grade.

3. **Fifth Grade:**
   - The fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth grade's pass rate.
   - The fourth grade's pass rate is 40 out of 100, which is 40%.
   - Twice 40% is 80%.
   - So, 80% of 400 fifth-graders passed.
   - 80% of 400 is 0.80 * 400 = 320 students.

4. **Total Students Who Passed:**
   - Third grade: 340
   - Fourth grade: 40
   - Fifth grade: 320
   - Total passed = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students.

5. **Total Students Who Took the Test:**

- Two friends: 240 minutes ÷ 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
- One friend: 240 minutes ÷ 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, let's add up all the quarters:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: 24 quarters each, so 24 + 24 = 48 quarters
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we need to find out how much 68 quarters cost:
- 68 quarters × 25 cents = 1700 cents

1700 cents is the same as 17 dollars.

So, the total amount of money used is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

Tanya makes a salt scrub that fits in a 10-ounce jar. She uses different things to make it: salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. Here's what we know:

1. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's use a simple letter to help us. Let's say the amount of citrus zest is \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the zest, the fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Now, the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the sugar, the sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

Now, let's add everything up to make sure it fits in the 10-ounce jar:
\[ z \text{ (zest)} + z \text{ (fragrance)} + 2z \text{ (salt)} + 2z \text{ (sugar)} + 4z \text{ (oil)} = 10 \text{ ounces} \]

This gives us:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]

To find \( z \), we divide both sides by 10:
\[ z = 1 \]

So, the amount of oil is \( 4z \):
\[ 4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much John spent on the goats. He bought 3 goats, and each goat costs $500. So, we multiply 3 by $500:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the cows. He bought 2 cows, and each cow costs $1500. So, we multiply 2 by $1500:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount John spent:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, John spent $4500 in total.

"Paul needs 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. Let's count how many he has in total:

8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy. We can do this by subtracting the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. So, Joe has:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold. So, he gives away:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left. We start with 40 cars, subtract the 8 cars he sold, and then subtract the 16 cars he gave away:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that the charity raised a total of $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 came from organizations. So, we need to find out how much the students raised. We do this by subtracting the amount from organizations from the total amount:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

So, the students raised $125,000 in total.

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

Now, let's add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we know that 1 hour is 60 minutes. So:

2. Then, during the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, we add those 20 cars to the 50 cars he already saw:
   \[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]
   Now there are 70 cars in the parking lot.
3. During the lunch break, half of the cars left. To find out how many cars left, we divide 70 by 2:

   So, 35 cars left.
4. To find out how many cars are left in the parking lot during the lunch break, we subtract the 35 cars that left from the 70 cars that were there:

1. **Cycles per day**: John does 30 cycles of work each day.
2. **Tasks per cycle**: Each cycle has 5 tasks.
3. **Money per task**: Each task pays $1.20.

First, let's find out how many tasks John does in one day:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Next, let's find out how much money John makes in one day:

In the second game, Sasha played away and scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so Sasha scored 4 points in the second game.

To find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we add the points from both games:
14 points (first game) + 4 points (second game) = 18 points

So, Sasha scored 18 points in total.

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought:
- She bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package has 6 tins.
- So, 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find out how many more tins of cat food she bought compared to dog food:
- Tins of cat food: 88
- Tins of dog food: 36

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards together. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ.

Let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. Then:
- Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards (because he has 3 times as many as PJ).
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards (because she has 12 more than Smendrick).

Now, we can add all their cards together to get the total:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Let's simplify that:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we need to find out what \( P \) is. We do this by subtracting 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

   - The book needs to be sent 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges 8 cents for each mile.
     \[
     20 \text{ miles} \times 8 \text{ cents/mile} = 160 \text{ cents} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month. That's a lot of chocolate!

- In the first week, he makes 8,000 bars.
- In the second week, he makes half as many as the first week, so that's 8,000 divided by 2, which is 4,000 bars.
- In the third week, he makes three times as many as the first week, so that's 8,000 times 3, which is 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up what he made in the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we subtract what he made in the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris makes 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - So, in one week, she spends \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes recording videos.
   - In a month with 4 weeks, she spends \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes recording videos.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours each week writing songs.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.
   - In a month with 4 weeks, she spends \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) minutes writing songs.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**

Now, let's see what Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

Next, we need to find out how many extra items Angela needs:
- For mirrors: She needs 6, but the package includes 4, so she needs 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors.
- For chandeliers: She needs 2, but the package includes 1, so she needs 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier.
- For pictures: She needs 20, but the package includes 10, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures.

Now, let's add up all the extra items:
- 2 extra mirrors + 1 extra chandelier + 10 extra pictures = 13 extra items

The cost for each extra item is $15. So, the cost for 13 extra items is:
- 13 extra items × $15 per item = $195

Finally, we add the cost of the extra items to the basic installation fee:

   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can think of it like this: the total time for all three kangaroos together is 18 hours.
   - So, if one kangaroo were to do it alone, it would take 18 hours for each kangaroo. But since there are 3 kangaroos, they share the work equally.

2. **Now, let's think about the turtles.**
   - The turtles are slower. Each turtle goes at half the speed of a kangaroo.
   - If a kangaroo takes 18 hours to cross the highway, a turtle, being half as fast, would take twice as long. So, one turtle would take 18 hours × 2 = 36 hours to cross the highway.

3. **But we have 4 turtles, not just one.**
   - If 4 turtles are working together, they can share the work. So, instead of one turtle taking 36 hours, 4 turtles will take less time.
   - To find out how much less time, we divide 36 hours by 4 (because 4 turtles are working together).

- Money from her mom: $80
- Total money from these sources: $150 + $80 = $230

The total cost of the laptop after the trade-in is $400. Erika still needs $50 more, so the money she has in her purse plus the $230 should equal $350 (because $400 - $50 = $350).

So, if we let \( x \) be the money in her purse:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from 350:

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes they have together:
- Total number of socks:
  \[
  \text{Total socks} = 30 + 60 = 90
  \]
- Total number of dishes:
  \[
  \text{Total dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90
  \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[
\text{Total} = 90 + 90 = 180

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Miss Susan's class has 20 students in total. We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students are good at English only.

To find out how many students are good at both math and English, we need to subtract the students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students.

So, we have:
- Total students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects:
20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:
5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Vicki is planning a big pop concert at her school. The concert will last for 2 hours, which is the same as 120 minutes. She wants to have a 10-minute break in the middle, so we need to take that time away from the total concert time.

120 minutes (total concert time) - 10 minutes (break) = 110 minutes left for the groups to perform.

Now, each group needs some time to get on stage, perform, and then leave the stage. Here's how it breaks down:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to leave the stage

So, each group needs:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes in total.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the time left by the time each group needs:
110 minutes ÷ 10 minutes/group = 11 groups

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert!

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First, we need to know how much interest Brenda earns each year.**
   - The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount.
   - The original amount is $300.
   - So, the interest each year is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars.

2. **Next, we need to find out how much interest she earns in 3 years.**
   - If she earns $225 each year, in 3 years she will earn \( 225 \times 3 = 675 \) dollars.

3. **Finally, we add the interest to the original amount to find the total.**
   - The original amount is $300.
   - The total interest earned is $675.
   - So, the total amount after 3 years is \( 300 + 675 = 975 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we have 40 white shirts. Half of these shirts have collars. So, we need to find out how many that is:
- Half of 40 is 20. So, 20 white shirts have collars.

Next, we need to find out how many white shirts don't have collars:
- If 20 white shirts have collars, then the rest don't. So, 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts don't have collars.

Now, let's look at the floral shirts. We have 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. We need to find out how many don't have buttons:
- If 20 floral shirts have buttons, then the rest don't. So, 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

Finally, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are compared to white shirts without collars:
- We have 30 floral shirts without buttons and 20 white shirts without collars.
- So, 30 - 20 = 10.

The answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Each tray can hold 30 eggs. So, we divide 900 by 30:

\[ 900 \div 30 = 30 \]

This means the farmer needs 30 trays to hold all the eggs.

Next, we need to find out how much money the farmer will make if he sells all the trays. Each tray is sold for $2.5. So, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

So, the farmer will earn $75.

The final answer is:

"Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. Let's figure out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether.

First, we need to find out how many goats he sold from Farm Y. He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X, so:
- He sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- He sold 2 times 10 goats from Farm Y, which is 20 goats.

Now, let's see how many goats are left in each farm:
- In Farm X, he had 55 goats and sold 10, so 55 - 10 = 45 goats are left.
- In Farm Y, he had 45 goats and sold 20, so 45 - 20 = 25 goats are left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
- 45 goats in Farm X + 25 goats in Farm Y = 70 goats.

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms is 70.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. He buys 2 pairs each month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, we multiply:

   2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
   \]

2. Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays for each pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:
   \[
   \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair}
   \]

So, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes on average.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much 3 baskets of green food cost. Each basket of green food costs $25, so:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
So, 3 baskets of green food cost $75.

Next, we need to find out how much 3 baskets of red food cost before the discount. Each basket of red food costs $18, so:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]
So, 3 baskets of red food cost $54 before the discount.

Now, we need to apply the discount. You get $2 off for each basket of red food, and you are buying 3 baskets, so:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
So, the total discount for the red food is $6.

Subtract the discount from the cost of the red food:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]
So, 3 baskets of red food cost $48 after the discount.

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food to get the total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how many rooms we need to clean. The motel has 90 rooms, and we only need to clean half of them. So, we divide 90 by 2:
\[ 90 \div 2 = 45 \]
So, we need to clean 45 rooms.

Next, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find out how long it will take to clean 45 rooms, we multiply 45 by 20:
\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \]
So, it will take 900 minutes to clean 45 rooms.

But we need to know how many hours that is. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 by 60:
\[ 900 \div 60 = 15 \]
So, it will take 15 hours to clean 45 rooms.

Next, in the second year, they build three times as many homes as they did in the first year. So, we need to multiply 12 by 3:
12 * 3 = 36 homes.

Now, in the third year, they count all the homes they've built so far and then double that number. So, we need to add the homes from the first two years:
12 + 36 = 48 homes.

Then, we double that number for the third year:
48 * 2 = 96 homes.

Finally, we add up all the homes built over the three years:
12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. I am three years younger than my brother. So if I am \( x \) years old, my brother is \( x + 3 \) years old.
2. I am two years older than my sister. So my sister is \( x - 2 \) years old.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. So my mom is \( 3 \times (x + 3) - 1 \) years old.
4. When you add all our ages together, it equals 87.

So, we can write this as:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3 \times (x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Let's break it down:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3 \times (x + 3) - 1 \)

Now, let's add them up:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3 \times (x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the mom's age:
\[ 3 \times (x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \]

Now, put it all together:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

On the first day, 10 people are sick. Each of these 10 people makes 6 more people sick. So, we need to find out how many new people get sick on the first day:

10 people * 6 = 60 new sick people

Now, we add the new sick people to the original 10 sick people to find out how many are sick after the first day:

10 + 60 = 70 sick people

On the second day, all 70 sick people each make 6 more people sick. So, we need to find out how many new people get sick on the second day:

70 people * 6 = 420 new sick people

Now, we add the new sick people to the 70 sick people to find out how many are sick after the second day:

70 + 420 = 490 sick people

On the third day, all 490 sick people each make 6 more people sick. So, we need to find out how many new people get sick on the third day:

490 people * 6 = 2940 new sick people

Now, we add the new sick people to the 490 sick people to find out how many are sick after the third day:

First, we need to find out how much money Rafaela got in tips. Each of the 40 customers gave her $20. So, we multiply 40 by 20:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela got $800 in tips.

Next, we need to figure out how much Julieta got. Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of 800, we can think of it as 10 out of 100 parts of 800. So, we divide 800 by 10:

\[ 800 \div 10 = 80 \]

This means 10% of 800 is 80. Since Julieta got 10% less, we subtract 80 from 800:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta got $720 in tips.

Now, to find out how much they both got together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the total amount of tips they both received is:

   - Claire gets 1 badge every month.
   - In one year, which has 12 months, Claire gets \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badges:**
   - Amber takes twice as long as Claire to get a badge.
   - So, Amber gets \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge every month.
   - In one year, Amber gets \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

We also know that:
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many books each person has.

1. Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which is \( F + 13 \) books.

Now, we can add up all the books:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can divide $21.00 by 7 to find the cost of one bottle:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

So, one bottle of soda costs $3.00.

Next, we need to find out how much one bottle of water costs. If 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we can divide $8.00 by 4 to find the cost of one bottle:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

So, one bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. We can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bottles by their respective costs and then adding them together.

For the soda:
\[ \text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]

For the water:
\[ \text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much 16 bolts cost. Each bolt costs 3 cents, so we multiply 16 by 3 cents:

16 bolts × 3 cents = 48 cents

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the bolts from the money David has. David has $12.48, and the bolts cost 48 cents. We need to subtract 48 cents from $12.48:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

12.00"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find out how much she earns in one hour, we divide the total money by the number of hours:
\[ 33 \div 3 = 11 \]
So, Ella earns $11 for each hour she walks dogs.

Now, we want to know how much she would earn if she works for 12 hours. We multiply the amount she earns per hour by the number of hours:
\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours.

"Paul had 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles. So, he had:

52 + 28 = 80 marbles

Then, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we do:

1/4 of 80 = 80 ÷ 4 = 20 marbles

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. Now, to find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total he had:

80 - 20 = 60 marbles

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"Okay, let's figure out how many points Amy gets on her history test. We need to look at each type of question and how many points she gets for each.

1. **Multiple-Choice Questions:**
   - There are 10 multiple-choice questions.
   - Amy gets 80% of them right.
   - 80% of 10 is \(10 \times 0.80 = 8\).
   - Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point.
   - So, she gets \(8 \times 1 = 8\) points from multiple-choice questions.

2. **True/False Questions:**
   - There are 20 true/false questions.
   - Amy gets 90% of them right.
   - 90% of 20 is \(20 \times 0.90 = 18\).
   - Each true/false question is worth 1 point.
   - So, she gets \(18 \times 1 = 18\) points from true/false questions.

3. **Long-Answer Questions:**
   - There are 5 long-answer questions.
   - Amy gets 60% of them right.
   - 60% of 5 is \(5 \times 0.60 = 3\).
   - Each long-answer question is worth 5 points.
   - So, she gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add up all the points:
- Points from multiple-choice questions: 8
- Points from true/false questions: 18
- Points from long-answer questions: 15

Total points: \(8 + 18 + 15 = 41\)

So, Amy scores 41 points on her history test.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and wants to sell 3/5 of them.
   - To find 3/5 of 300, we do: \( 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \)
   - So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

2. Next, we need to figure out how much money he will make from selling these 180 chickens. Each chicken sells for $50.
   - To find the total money from selling 180 chickens, we do: \( 180 \times 50 = 9000 \)
   - So, Isaias will make $9000 from selling the chickens.

3. Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. This means the money he makes from selling the chickens ($9000) minus the money he spent to buy the chickens should be $2000.
   - To find out how much he spent to buy the chickens, we do: \( 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \)
   - So, Isaias spent $7000 to buy the chickens.

The amount of money Isaias spent to buy the chickens is:
\[ 7000 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade together. Julie sold 14 glasses. So, we need to find out how many glasses the boys sold together.

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's) = 18 glasses (boys' total)

Now, since Micah and Mitchell sold the same number of glasses, we need to split the 18 glasses equally between them.

18 glasses ÷ 2 = 9 glasses each

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah.

14 glasses (Julie's) - 9 glasses (Micah's) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. For the manicure, she spent 1/4 of what she spent on her hair. So, we need to find 1/4 of $400:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
   So, she spent $100 on the manicure.
3. For the pedicure, she spent 3/4 of what she spent on the manicure. So, we need to find 3/4 of $100:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
   So, she spent $75 on the pedicure.

Now, let's add up all the money she spent:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575

"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, if Sarah sells the rope, she will get:

20 meters × $2/meter = $40

Sarah wants to use this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. If she buys 20 meters of the new rope, it will cost her:

20 meters × $1.5/meter = $30

After buying the new rope, Sarah will have:

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, if we want to find out how old she is now, we can do a simple subtraction:

18 - 10 = 8

So, Melanie is 8 years old right now.

Next, we need to figure out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. If she is 8 years old now, three times her age would be:

3 × 8 = 24

So, we need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old. We can set up a simple equation:

8 + x = 24

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides:

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie will be 24 years old, which is three times her current age.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much each pack of bacon costs. Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon for $10. So, each pack of bacon costs:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, each packet of chicken costs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for the chicken is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for the strawberries is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, each pack of apples costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for the apples is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Kelly has 5 dollars left in her budget."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Elaina's final concert is 65 minutes long. This includes a 15-minute encore at the end. So, the actual concert part, without the encore, is:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Now, the problem says that this 50-minute concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. So, if we let \( x \) be the length of her usual concerts, then:

2 times \( x \) = 50 minutes

To find \( x \), we divide 50 by 2:

50 ÷ 2 = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

- He gives 40 toys to Alyssa.
- He gives 80 toys to Bonnie.
- He gives 30 toys to Nicky.

First, we need to find out how many toys Argo gave away in total. We do this by adding the toys he gave to each friend:
40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, we need to find out how many toys Argo has left. We do this by subtracting the total number of toys he gave away from the number of toys he started with:
200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Tuesday: 125
- Wednesday: 125
- Friday: 250

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is:

20% of 50 is:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones can't be paired up. That means the number of microphones that can be paired up is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones we can make with 40 microphones. Each pair has 2 microphones, so:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many petals all the orchids have together:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- So, 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals for the orchids.

Next, we need to find out how many petals all the daisies have together:
- Joelle has 4 daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- So, 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals for the daisies.

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids:
- Daisies have 40 petals.
- Orchids have 25 petals.
- So, 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 more petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

   So, there are 25 indoor plants.

3. Now, we need to find out how many plants are left after taking away the indoor plants:
   \[
   100 - 25 = 75
   \]
   So, there are 75 plants left.

4. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we need to find two-thirds of 75:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

5. The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We already know there are 75 plants left after the indoor plants, and 50 of those are outdoor plants. So, the number of flowering plants is:
   \[
   75 - 50 = 25
   \]
   So, there are 25 flowering plants.

6. To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and then multiply by 100:
   \[
   \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

4. The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) dollars.
5. Ellen pays $11 in total for her food every day.
6. So, the cost of the two carrots is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) dollars.
7. Since she eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

Let's break it down:

- **First week:**
  - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as much as Joe's.
  - If Joe's lawn was mowed once, Kamala's was mowed 3 times.

- **Second week:**
  - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as much as Joe's.
  - If Joe's lawn was mowed once, Alba's was mowed 5 times.

So, if Joe's lawn was mowed once:
- Kamala's lawn was mowed 3 times.
- Alba's lawn was mowed 5 times.

**Total times Tasha mowed lawns:**
- Joe's lawn: 1 time
- Kamala's lawn: 3 times
- Alba's lawn: 5 times
- Total: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 times

**Since Joe paid $6 for all the mowing:**
- Tasha made $6 from mowing lawns.

**Now, we need to find out how much she made from lemonade:**

First, we need to find out how much material Jo needs for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, she needs \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, we need to find out how much material Jo needs for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, she needs \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we add the material needed for both types of masks:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Dean has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. To find out how many marbles that is, we need to divide 30 by 5:
30 ÷ 5 = 6 marbles.

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Now, Dean has:
30 - 6 = 24 marbles left.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. So, we subtract 10 from the 24 marbles Dean has left:
24 - 10 = 14 marbles.

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Duncan is 60 years old now. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

The problem says that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, 52 is two times Adam's age four years ago.

To find Adam's age four years ago, we divide 52 by 2:
52 ÷ 2 = 26

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. To find out how old Adam is now, we add 4 years to 26:
26 + 4 = 30

Adam is 30 years old now. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 years to 30:
30 + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Farmer Brown has a farm that is 200 acres big. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we need to find out what twice 200 acres is, and then add 100 acres to that.

Twice 200 acres is:
\[ 200 \times 2 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to 400 acres:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we need to find out how many packages Colby completes in one hour. The problem says he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we do:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Colby makes for each package. The problem says he gets $0.20 for each package. So, for 40 packages, he makes:
   \[
   40 \times 0.20 = 8 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to find out how much money Colby makes in a whole workday. The problem says he works for 8 hours each day. So, for 8 hours, he makes:
   \[
   8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Colby earns 64 dollars in a typical eight-hour workday.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. First, we need to figure out how long it takes John to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.
   - A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal one.
   - So, we multiply 45 minutes by 4: \( 45 \times 4 = 180 \) minutes.

2. Now, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes.
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes.
   - To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30: \( 180 \div 30 = 6 \).

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. In total, he threw 58 pieces of bologna. We know that there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna Benny threw at the red balloons:
- He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- There are 20 red balloons.
- So, he threw \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

Now, we know that the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. So, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
- Total pieces of bologna: 58
- Pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons: 40
- Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons: \( 58 - 40 = 18 \)

Next, we need to find out how many yellow balloons there are. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. So, if he threw 18 pieces of bologna at the yellow balloons, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing 18 by 3:
- Number of yellow balloons: \( 18 \div 3 = 6 \)

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is:

100 miles/day × 30 days = 3000 miles

Next, we need to know how many times Jon's car needs a tune-up. The car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per tune-up:

3000 miles ÷ 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

So, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, he works twice as long as he did on Tuesday. So, he works \(5 \times 2 = 10\) hours.
3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday. So, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours:
- Tuesday: 5 hours

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Julia and Nadine both got the same amount of money from their mom. They decided to use all their money to buy a birthday surprise for their dad. Here's what they bought:

1. A cake that costs $11.
2. Balloons that cost $0.5 for every 2 balloons. They bought 12 balloons.
3. Two tubs of ice cream, each costing $7.

First, let's figure out how much the balloons cost:
- 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 times $0.5
- 6 times $0.5 = $3

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice cream: 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Total cost:
- $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine spent all their money together, and they each got the same amount from their mom, we need to split the total cost in half:
- $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mom gave each of them $14.

"Okay, let's count the students step by step!

1. **Tennis**: There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. **Volleyball**: There are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis. So, we need to multiply the number of tennis players by 2:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12

"To figure out how much money the class made from selling lollipops, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, we find out how many lollipops all the students sold together. If each of the 30 students sold 10 lollipops, then:
   \[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

2. Next, we calculate how much money they made from selling these lollipops. If each lollipop was sold for $0.8, then:
   \[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Then, we need to find out how much it cost to buy the lollipops. If each lollipop cost $0.5, then:
   \[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the cost from the money made:

   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, he has:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ rabbits}
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, he has:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ fish}

3. Together, Abby and Josh eat 2 slices (Abby) + 4 slices (Josh) = 6 slices each day.
4. The loaf has 24 slices in total.
5. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat each day: 24 slices ÷ 6 slices per day = 4 days.

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old. She collects one shell every month. We need to find out how many shells she will have by the time she turns 10 years old.

First, we need to figure out how many years she has been collecting shells:
10 years old - 5 years old = 5 years

Next, we need to know how many months are in 5 years:
5 years × 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell every month, we can find out how many shells she has by the time she turns 10:
60 months × 1 shell/month = 60 shells

So, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

"Lana is making tea for her friends. She has 27 cups and puts them in 3 rows. In each row, she makes the same number of chamomile and mint tea cups. She also makes 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

First, we need to find out how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea after making the cinnamon tea. We do this by subtracting the cinnamon tea cups from the total cups:

27 cups - 15 cups = 12 cups

These 12 cups are for chamomile and mint tea, and they are divided equally into 3 rows. So, we divide 12 cups by 3 rows:

12 cups ÷ 3 rows = 4 cups per row

In each row, there are the same number of chamomile and mint tea cups. So, we divide the 4 cups in each row by 2:

4 cups ÷ 2 = 2 cups

So, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

1. **How long does one trip take?**
   - The sloth takes 4 hours for one trip to go down the tree, pick berries, and climb back up.

2. **How many trips can the sloth make in 8 hours?**
   - If one trip takes 4 hours, then in 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

3. **How many berries does the sloth need to pick up in total?**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries.

4. **How many berries does the sloth need to pick up per trip?**
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips and needs 24 berries, then he needs to pick up \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know the pool has 10,000 gallons of water. Anthony and his dad fill a tank with half of that water. So, we need to find half of 10,000:

\[ 10,000 \div 2 = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the tank starts with 5,000 gallons of water.

Next, they use 500 gallons of water from the tank each day to water their garden. We need to find out how much water they use in 6 days:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of water used in 6 days from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water left in the tank.

   - Colby gets $150 from his parents to spend at the movies.

2. **Money spent on movies so far:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10.
     - So, \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
   - He saw 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7.
     - So, \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
   - Total spent on movies: \(50 + 56 = 106\) dollars.

3. **Money spent on snacks so far:**
   - He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8.
     - So, \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
   - He bought 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2.
     - So, \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
   - Total spent on snacks: \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

4. **Total money spent so far:**
   - Total spent on movies and snacks: \(106 + 24 = 130\) dollars.

5. **Money left:**
   - Colby started with $150.
   - He has spent $130.
   - So, \(150 - 130 = 20\) dollars left.

6. **Cost for the last night:**
   - It's a Friday, so the movie ticket costs $10.
   - He wants a tub of popcorn, which costs $8.
   - He wants a box of candy, which costs $2.
   - Total for the night: \(10 + 8 + 2 = 20\) dollars.

7. **Can he afford the last night?**
   - Yes, he has exactly $20 left, which is enough for the movie, popcorn, and candy.

8. **Total number of movies he can see:**
   - He has already seen 13 movies (5 on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 on other days).
   - He can see 1 more movie tonight.

\[ 600 \div 3 = 200 \]
So, one mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has 1/3 of that. So, we do:
\[ 450 \div 3 = 150 \]
So, one mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.

Now, Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls. To find out how many calories are in all the mini cinnamon rolls, we multiply:

- Tuesday: 2 times 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 times 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add them all together:

39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

First, add 39 and 78:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean together are 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus Jean's age.

Let's use some simple math to figure this out:

- Let's say Jean is \( J \) years old.
- Then Paul is \( J + 10 \) years old (because Paul is 10 years older than Jean).
- Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) \), which is \( 2J + 10 \).

Now, we know that the total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Let's add these up:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find \( J \):
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 100 - 20 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, Jean is 20 years old.

Now, let's find Paul's age:
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And Peter's age:
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter is 50 years old.

Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, we multiply:
35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, we add the distances to find the total distance both of them spit:
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average, we divide the total distance by the number of people, which is 2:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. We need to figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, let's find out how many widgets each machine makes in one day:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets every hour. If it runs for 24 hours, it makes:
  \[
  60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}
  \]

- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets every hour. If it runs for 24 hours, it makes:
  \[
  45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}

Next, let's find out how many widgets each machine makes in one month (30 days):
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes:
  \[
  1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}
  \]

- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes:
  \[
  1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. That's 17 hours in total. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For every hour after that, it costs 70 pesos.

First, we need to figure out how many extra hours Cameron stays:
17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours

Now, we calculate the cost for these extra hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost him 1600 pesos. To find out how much he saved, we subtract the cost of his actual stay from the 24-hour stay cost:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saved 250 pesos.

"Okay, let's figure out how much hay Nate needs for his animals.

First, we need to know how much hay each goat and each sheep needs:
- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs. So, we first find out what twice a goat's hay is: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Then, we subtract 3 pounds: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total hay for the goats:
- Nate has 15 goats.
- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
- So, for 15 goats, the total hay is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total hay for the sheep:
- Nate has 12 sheep.
- Each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.
- So, for 12 sheep, the total hay is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total amount of hay:
- Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
- Total hay = \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money John made this week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked for 6 hours. So, we do:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John spends 50 dollars on gas. So, we subtract that from his total earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, John wants to put 100 dollars in the bank. So, we subtract that too:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John buys 5 pencils, and each pencil costs 10 dollars. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

We subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, John wants to buy some pens, and each pen costs 25 dollars. To find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:
\[ 100 \div 25 = 4 \]

So, John can buy 4 pens.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

Craig and his brother are playing a game where they spell out long words and count the letters. After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words, and each word has 15 letters. So, we need to find out how many letters Craig has spelled in total.

First, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word:
\[ 20 \text{ words} \times 15 \text{ letters per word} = 300 \text{ letters} \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled out words with 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the number of letters Craig has spelled:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 50 \text{ letters} = 350 \text{ letters} \]

Now, to find the total number of letters both Craig and his brother have spelled, we add the letters Craig has spelled to the letters his brother has spelled:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 350 \text{ letters} = 650 \text{ letters} \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

First, we know that there are 8 children in each row. 

Next, we know that there are 7 rows for each school. 

And there are 5 different schools participating.

To find out how many children there are in total, we need to multiply these numbers together:

1. First, we multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows per school:
   8 children/row × 7 rows/school = 56 children/school

2. Then, we multiply the number of children per school by the number of schools:
   56 children/school × 5 schools = 280 children

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has in total. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can get 100 bottles of apple juice. So, we multiply 9 by 100:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Next, we need to figure out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, we multiply 29 by 2:

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are left for the teacher. We subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Visit Charge**: Patty charges $40 just to come to your house.
2. **Labor Charge**: Patty charges $35 for each hour of work. The job took 2.25 hours. So, we need to multiply 2.25 by 35.
   - 2.25 hours × $35/hour = $78.75
3. **Parts Charge**: The job also used $60 worth of parts.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
- Visit Charge: $40
- Labor Charge: $78.75
- Parts Charge: $60

Total charge = $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75

So, Patty charged **$178.75** for the job.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. James gets 10 new CDs. Each CD costs $15.
   - So, the total cost of the CDs before any discount is:
     \[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

2. James gets a 40% discount on the CDs.
   - To find the discount amount, we calculate 40% of $150:
     \[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

3. The discount is $60, so we subtract this from the total cost to find out how much James actually paid:
   \[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

4. James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40.
   - So, he gets $40 back from selling these CDs.

5. To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid:
   \[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

50"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops. We need to add up the money she gets from each type of crop.

First, let's look at the yams:
- Jen has 6 yams.
- Each yam sells for $1.5.
- So, for the yams, she will earn 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

Next, the sweet potatoes:
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato sells for $2.
- So, for the sweet potatoes, she will earn 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

Finally, the carrots:
- Jen has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot sells for $1.25.
- So, for the carrots, she will earn 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Now, we add up all the money:
- Total earnings = $9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34.

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, how far does James swim at the start?**
   - The lake is 20 miles long.
   - James swims 60% of the lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles.

2. **How long does it take him to swim the first part?**
   - James swims at 2 miles per hour.
   - To swim 12 miles, it takes \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \) hours.

3. **How long does he rest?**
   - He rests for half the time he swam.
   - Half of 6 hours is \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \) hours.

4. **How far does he have left to swim?**
   - He has already swum 12 miles.
   - The total distance is 20 miles.
   - So, he has \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles left.

5. **How fast does he swim the rest of the way?**
   - He swims at half his original speed.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour is \( 2 \div 2 = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **How long does it take him to swim the remaining 8 miles?**
   - At 1 mile per hour, it takes \( 8 \div 1 = 8 \) hours.

7. **What is the total time?**
   - He swam for 6 hours, rested for 3 hours, and swam for 8 more hours.
   - Total time is \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

Next, we need to figure out what ""seven times as many"" means. If Sam had 70 loaves, then seven times that would be:
7 * 70 = 490

Now, the problem says the bakery has 40 less than this number. So, we need to subtract 40 from 490:
490 - 40 = 450

First, we need to find out how much money Cayley makes from selling the New York Times. Each copy of the New York Times costs $5, and Cayley gets 10% of that as a commission. 

To find 10% of $5, we do:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]
So, Cayley makes $0.50 for each New York Times he sells.

Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]
Cayley makes $3.00 from the New York Times.

Next, we need to find out how much money Cayley makes from selling the Wall Street Journal. Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15, and Cayley gets 8% of that as a commission.

To find 8% of $15, we do:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]
So, Cayley makes $1.20 for each Wall Street Journal he sells.

Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]
Cayley makes $12.00 from the Wall Street Journal.

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. We also know that Bahati scored the most points, and that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many points Azibo scored.

1. First, let's say Bahati scored \( B \) points.
2. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Azibo scored \( B - 20 \) points.
3. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Dinar scored \( B - 10 \) points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write this as:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Let's add up the points:
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( B \):
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 45 + 30 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

So, Bahati scored 25 points.

Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ A = 25 - 20 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

To find out how many hours that is, we can count:
- From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM (noon) is 4 hours.
- From 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours.
- So, 4 hours + 11 hours = 15 hours.

Next, we need to know how many minutes are in 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:
- 15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he staples in each interval:
- 60 intervals × 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

   - Kim usually goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours is the same as 8 times 60 minutes, which equals 480 minutes.

2. **Time Spent Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - To find out how long she was sleepwalking, we subtract 2:15 from 2:38.
   - 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes.

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - She usually wakes up at 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - This means she lost 5 minutes of sleep.

4. **Total Time Lost:**

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. The problem says he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, we need to subtract 6 from the 16 measuring spoons he originally had:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons left} \]

Finally, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has left:

First, we know the hospital has 1000 beds. Right now, 1/5 of these beds are being used. To find out how many beds are being used, we do:

1000 ÷ 5 = 200 beds

So, 200 beds are already occupied.

Next, we're told that 50 new patients come to the hospital each day. We need to find out how many patients will come in 2 weeks. Since 2 weeks have 14 days, we do:

50 patients/day × 14 days = 700 patients

So, 700 more patients will be admitted in 2 weeks.

Now, we add the patients already in the hospital to the new patients:

200 beds + 700 beds = 900 beds

This means 900 beds will be occupied after 2 weeks.

Finally, to find out how many beds are still empty, we subtract the occupied beds from the total number of beds:

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. But Kelly thinks Courtney made a mistake and said there were 20% more people than there really were.

To find out how many people really attended, we need to figure out what number, when increased by 20%, equals 48.

First, let's remember what 20% means. It's the same as 20 out of 100, or 0.20.

Now, if we let the real number of people be \( x \), then 20% more than \( x \) is \( x + 0.20x \). This is the same as \( 1.20x \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's do the division:

   Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together caught 339 Pokemon.

2. **Alex's Pokemon:**
   Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan. So if Stan caught \( S \) Pokemon, Alex caught \( S + 5 \) Pokemon.

3. **Stan's Pokemon:**
   Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe. If Adelwolfe caught \( A \) Pokemon, then Stan caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.

4. **Equation for Total Pokemon:**
   We know the total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339. So we can write:
   \[
   A + S + (S + 5) = 339

   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   A + 2S + 5 = 339

   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   A + 2S = 334
   \]

5. **Substitute Stan's Pokemon:**
   We know \( S = 4A - 13 \). Substitute this into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
   \[
   A + 2(4A - 13) = 334

   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   A + 8A - 26 = 334

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. Each episode of the show is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes in one episode. So, if one episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is 20 divided by 2, which is 10 episodes.
3. To find out how many minutes John will spend watching all the episodes, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode. So, 10 episodes times 20 minutes per episode equals 200 minutes.

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. To find out how far it goes, we multiply the time by the speed:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. Again, we multiply the time by the speed:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We do the same thing:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, we need to figure out the total distance the bird traveled south. We add the distances it flew south and subtract the distance it flew north:
\[
300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
374 \text{ miles}
\]

"Greta made 12 brownies for herself. Her office gave her 6 more brownies. Her friends brought 48 brownies to her surprise party. During the party, 18 brownies were eaten.

To find out how many brownies Greta had left, we add up all the brownies she had and then take away the ones that were eaten.

First, we add the brownies:
12 (from Greta) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

Then, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so that means his brother is 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find out how much younger, we take 25% of 8, which is 2. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, to find the total age of all three, we add their ages together:
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30

So, the total age of all three family members is 30.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long it takes to string each type of racquet:

1. **Synthetic Gut:**
   - Andy needs to string 3 racquets.
   - It takes him 15 minutes for each racquet.
   - So, for 3 racquets: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes.

2. **Polyester String:**
   - Andy needs to string 5 racquets.
   - It takes him 22 minutes for each racquet.
   - So, for 5 racquets: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes.

3. **Hybrid Set:**
   - Andy needs to string 4 racquets.
   - It takes him 18 minutes for each racquet.
   - So, for 4 racquets: \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Total time for synthetic gut: 45 minutes
- Total time for polyester string: 110 minutes
- Total time for hybrid set: 72 minutes

So, the total time Andy will take to string all the racquets is:
\[ 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \] minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

John is buying phones for himself, his wife, and his two kids. That's 4 phones in total. Each phone costs $600, but the phones after the first two are half price.

1. The first phone costs $600.
2. The second phone also costs $600.
3. The third phone is half price, so it costs $600 ÷ 2 = $300.
4. The fourth phone is also half price, so it costs $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600
- Third phone: $300
- Fourth phone: $300

Total cost: $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that Carlton's team has 13 players. That's a fact.

Now, Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we need to add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team to find out how many players are on Zeke's team.

13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20 (Zeke's players)

Now, to find out how many players are on both teams combined, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team.

13 (Carlton's players) + 20 (Zeke's players) = 33

So, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how long the fence will be all the way around. This is called the perimeter. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we add up all the sides. 

The garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. So, we have two sides that are 15 feet each and two sides that are 10 feet each. 

Let's add them up:
15 + 15 + 10 + 10 = 50 feet

So, the fence will be 50 feet long all the way around.

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we need to multiply the total length of the fence by 2 to find out how many slats he needs.

50 feet × 2 slats per foot = 100 slats

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. That means she gave away 4 boxes in total.

So, she had:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

Then, she kept 1/4 of the 8 boxes for herself. To find out how many boxes that is, we do:
1/4 of 8 = 2 boxes.

So, she kept 2 boxes and sold the rest. The rest is:
8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Each box has 20 oranges, so the number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

1. First, we need to know how many states are in the USA. The USA has 50 states.
2. Now, we need to find out how many states India has. The problem says India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
3. Half of 50 is 25.
4. So, India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.
5. To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

So, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up how much all the books cost:
- The dictionary costs $18.
- The dinosaur book costs $13.
- The cookbook costs $8.

So, we add them together:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

The total cost of the books is $39.

Next, we need to see how much more money Tyler needs. He has already saved $14. So, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the books.

Tyler earns $5 for each hour he works. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to get enough money for the books.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we know that Robert has 30 cherries. The problem also tells us that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. So, if we take away 10 cherries from Robert's 30 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Richard has:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]
So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We already figured out that Robert has 30 cherries and Richard has 20 cherries. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can subtract the number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total:
\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \]
So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Finally, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We know Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. So, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Sunny made from selling gingerbread and apple pie over the weekend.

**Saturday:**
- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

**Sunday:**
- Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's add up all the boxes sold over the two days:
- Total gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

Next, we need to find out how much money Sunny made from each type of item:
- Gingerbread costs $6 per box, so 25 boxes * $6 = $150
- Apple pie costs $15 per box, so 21 boxes * $15 = $315

Finally, we add the money from both items to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of:

1. **How much sunscreen does Pamela use each day?**
   - Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours each day.
   - So, she uses \(1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}\).

2. **How much sunscreen does she use over 8 days?**
   - She uses 4 ounces each day.
   - She is on vacation for 8 days.
   - So, she uses \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

3. **How many 8-ounce bottles does she need?**
   - Each bottle has 8 ounces.
   - She needs 32 ounces in total.
   - So, she needs \(32 \text{ ounces} \div 8 \text{ ounces/bottle} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper, which means it costs 60% of the blue car's price. 

To find 60% of $100:
60% of $100 = 0.60 * $100 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

The total cost of both cars is $160.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Emil's Age Now:**
   - Emil is 19 years old right now.

2. **Emil's Age in 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old because \(19 + 5 = 24\).

3. **Dad's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - So, if Emil is 24, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

4. **Dad's Age Now:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, his dad is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old now.

5. **Brother's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - So, if Emil is 24, his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

6. **Brother's Age Now:**
   - Since Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, his brother is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old now.

7. **Sum of Dad's and Brother's Ages Now:**
   - Dad is 43 years old.

1. **Thursday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. That's like having 3 big bags of crawfish.

2. **Friday's Catch:**
   On Friday, Joe caught 4 times as much as he did on Thursday. So, we need to multiply 3 pounds by 4.
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   That's like having 12 big bags of crawfish!

3. **Saturday's Catch:**
   On Saturday, Joe caught half of what he caught on Friday. So, we need to divide 12 pounds by 2.
   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   That's like having 6 big bags of crawfish.

4. **Total Catch:**
   Now, we add up all the crawfish Joe caught over the three days.
   \[
   3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}

First, we need to find out how many football players there are in Mr. Roper's class. We know that 20% of the class are football players. 

To find 20% of 30 students:
20% of 30 = 0.20 × 30 = 6 students

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players leave:
30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. We know that 25% of the remaining students are in these groups.

To find 25% of 24 students:
25% of 24 = 0.25 × 24 = 6 students

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Finally, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:
6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

So, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

1. **First, we need to know how much space each plant and the space between them take up:**
   - Each plant is 1 foot wide.
   - Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet of space between each plant.
   - So, each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111-foot flower bed:**
   - We divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the space between it take up.
   - 111 ÷ 2.5 = 44.4
   - Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

3. **Now, we need to find out how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already has 17 plants.
   - She needs 44 plants in total.
   - So, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

4. **Finally, we need to calculate how much money Pat will spend:**

- She wants 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each basket.

Next, we need to know how much each type of plant costs:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

Now, let's find out how much it costs to fill one basket:
- For the petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 each = $9.00
- For the sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 each = $5.00

So, the total cost for one basket is:
- $9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (vines) = $14.00

Katherine has 5 baskets to fill, so we need to multiply the cost of one basket by 5:

Now, let's see how much she saves in a year:
$500 every month * 12 months = $6,000.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000. So, to find out how many pairs she can buy, we divide the total amount she saves by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ 90 \div 6 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes her 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. We know she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute sessions she needs to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30:

\[ 90 \div 30 = 3 \]

So, she needs 3 sessions to cook 90 shrimp. Since each session takes 10 minutes, we multiply 3 by 10:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes her 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

2. **Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times as old as his dad was when he saw the comet.**
   - If Bill's dad was 30, then three times that age is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
   - So, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **The comet comes back every 75 years.**
   - This means that 75 years passed between the first time Bill saw the comet and the second time he saw it.

4. **To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time:**

First, we know that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland. The problem says that these 44 trips are only half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, if 44 is half, then the first plane must make twice as many trips. 

To find out how many trips the first plane makes, we do:
\[ 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

So, the first plane makes 88 trips in total.

Next, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its trips. To find out how many trips that is, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

So, the first plane makes 66 trips to Greece.

Now, the remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany. To find out how many trips are left, we subtract the trips to Greece from the total trips:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]

These 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany. So, the number of trips to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

So, the first plane makes 11 trips to France in one day.

   - Now, we add up all the howl times:
   - Tobias: 20 seconds
   - Chikote: 40 seconds
   - Igneous: 60 seconds
   - Total: 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds

5. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - So, 120 seconds / 60 = 2 minutes

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. Adam's mom gave him $6.
2. Adam's dad gave him twice as much as his mom, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. So, Adam got \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars from his parents.
4. The trousers cost $30.
5. To find out how much Adam had to pay from his own savings, we subtract the money he got from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

So, Adam had to contribute 12 dollars from his savings.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have four friends: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know a few things:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- The total age of all four friends is 20 years.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's find out the total age of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, the total age of Helene and Wilfred together must be:
\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \]

Now, let's figure out Helene's age. The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as this average age:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

So, Helene is 10 years old. Now we know:
\[ H = 10 \]

We already found that the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13:
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Since Helene is 10 years old:
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]

To find Wilfred's age, we subtract 10 from 13:
\[ W = 13 - 10 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

The age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, Walter collects money from his neighbors. He gets $500. Then, he collects more money from an online fund. He gets $1500 from that. So, we add these two amounts together:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, Walter's friend gives him $200. We need to add this to the total amount he has collected so far:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Now, Walter's lawyer says he will donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. So, we need to multiply the total amount collected by 3:
\[ 2200 \times 3 = 6600 \]

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute:
\[ 6600 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how many cookies there are in total. There are 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, we multiply 100 by 15:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride gave half of these cookies to the church. So, we need to find half of 1500:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people got cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church who got cookies is:

50"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're sharing a big yummy watermelon with a family of 6 people. There are 2 grown-ups and 4 kids. The grown-ups want bigger slices, so each grown-up gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's say each kid gets a small slice, and we'll call that slice ""1 part."" So, each grown-up gets ""2 parts"" because it's twice as big.

Now, let's count all the parts:
- Each kid gets 1 part, and there are 4 kids, so that's 4 parts.
- Each grown-up gets 2 parts, and there are 2 grown-ups, so that's 4 parts.

So, the whole watermelon is divided into 8 parts (4 parts for the kids + 4 parts for the grown-ups).

Each grown-up gets 2 parts out of the 8 parts. To find out what percentage of the watermelon each grown-up gets, we can do this:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of parts each grown-up gets}}{\text{Total number of parts}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each grown-up gets 25% of the watermelon.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Time for Rounds:**
   - Doctor Jones has to check on 9 inpatients.
   - Each check takes 20 minutes.
   - So, 9 inpatients * 20 minutes each = 180 minutes.

2. **Time for Appointments:**
   - Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - So, 10 appointments * 30 minutes each = 300 minutes.

3. **Total Time Spent:**
   - Add the time for rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, 480 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours.

5. **Time Left for Updating Records:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 hours in total.
   - He spends 8 hours on rounds and appointments.
   - So, 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left.

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"Jordan wants to make a birthday cake for her mom. She needs to do a few things to get the cake ready:

- Mix the batter: 20 minutes
- Bake the cake: 30 minutes
- Let the cake cool: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
- Frost the cake: 10 minutes

First, let's add up all the time Jordan needs:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, 180 minutes is the same as 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. So, we need to figure out what time she should start to finish by 5:00 pm.

If we count back 3 hours from 5:00 pm, we get:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars. Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, and Peter sold 4 and a half boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. We need to find out how many chocolate bars are in one box.

First, let's add up how many boxes they sold in total:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
- So, together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Now, we know that 8 boxes of chocolate bars equal 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
- 64 chocolate bars ÷ 8 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box.

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

1. First, we need to find out how much it costs to rent the studio for one session. The studio costs $25 to rent each time.
2. Then, we need to add the cost for the students. Each student costs $1.50 per session, and there are 10 students. So, we do 10 students times $1.50, which is $15.
3. Now, we add the cost to rent the studio and the cost for the students for one session. That's $25 + $15, which equals $40.
4. The studio is rented 3 days a week. So, we multiply the cost of one session by 3. That's $40 times 3, which equals $120.
5. Finally, we need to find out how much it costs in a month. We assume a month has 4 weeks. So, we multiply the weekly cost by 4. That's $120 times 4, which equals $480.

So, the expected cost for the dance studio in a month is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[ \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:

\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. The problem says that 3 out of every 5 porcupines are female. So, we can find the number of female porcupines by multiplying the total number of porcupines by 3/5:
   \[
   50 \times \frac{3}{5} = 30
   \]
   So, there are 30 female porcupines.

2. Next, we need to figure out how many babies these female porcupines will have each month. Each female porcupine has 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   30 \times 4 = 120
   \]
   That's 120 baby porcupines every month!

3. Now, we need to find out how many babies are born in a whole year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
   \[
   120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]
   That's 1440 baby porcupines in a year!

4. Finally, we add the number of baby porcupines to the original number of porcupines to find the total number of porcupines after a year:
   \[
   50 + 1440 = 1490

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to fill the pool. Here's what we need to do:

1. First, we need to find out how much space the pool takes up. We do this by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool.
   - The pool is 25 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 4 feet deep.
   - So, we multiply 25 by 14 by 4:
     \[
     25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet}
     \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many gallons of water the pool can hold. The pool company told us to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
   - So, we multiply 1400 by 5.9:
     \[
     1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. Finally, we need to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool. The pool company charges $0.10 for each gallon of water.
   - So, we multiply 8260 by 0.10:
     \[
     8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars}

   So, there are 14 blue sticks.
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, we subtract 3 from 14:

   14 - 3 = 11
   \]
   So, there are 11 yellow sticks.

Now, let's add up all the sticks:

Next, we need to find out how far Shandy traveled. Shandy went 45 miles every hour for 10 hours. So, we multiply 45 by 10:
45 × 10 = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many more miles Shandy traveled than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
450 - 220 = 230 miles

So, Shandy traveled 230 miles farther than Matteo.

1. **Total Students**: The school has 3000 students.
2. **Students Over 16**: Half of the students are over 16 years old. So, we divide 3000 by 2:
   \[
   3000 \div 2 = 1500
   \]
   So, there are 1500 students over 16.
3. **Male Students Over 16**: One-fourth of the students over 16 are male. So, we divide 1500 by 4:
   \[
   1500 \div 4 = 375
   \]
   So, there are 375 male students over 16.
4. **Female Students Over 16**: The rest of the students over 16 are female. So, we subtract the male students from the total students over 16:
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]
   So, there are 1125 female students over 16.
5. **Students Under 16**: The other half of the students are under 16 years old. So, we divide 3000 by 2 again:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

Maria had a power bank that she was using to charge her friends' phones at the park. The power bank lost some of its charge over time. We need to figure out how much charge it had when she first went to the park.

1. **First, let's look at the last part:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, it had 28% charge left.
   - If it lost 7% each hour, it means it kept 93% of its charge each hour.
   - So, if we go back one hour, it had more charge. We can find out how much by dividing 28% by 0.93 (which is 93% as a decimal).

   \[
   \text{Charge before the last 3 hours} = \frac{28}{0.93 \times 0.93 \times 0.93} \approx 34.8\%
   \]

2. **Now, let's look at the first part:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, it had 34.8% charge left.
   - If it lost 9% each hour, it means it kept 91% of its charge each hour.
   - So, if we go back one hour, it had more charge. We can find out how much by dividing 34.8% by 0.91 (which is 91% as a decimal).

   \[
   \text{Charge before the first 5 hours} = \frac{34.8}{0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91} \approx 58.9\%

First, we need to find out how much money Janet needs to save for the car. The car costs $10,000, and she wants to save 20% of that for a down payment. 

To find 20% of $10,000, we can do this:
\[ 10,000 \times 0.20 = 2,000 \]

So, Janet needs to save $2,000.

Next, we need to figure out how much money Janet makes in one hour. She gets $10 from her job and $15 from tips, so:
\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \]

Janet makes $25 every hour.

Now, let's see how much she makes in one week. She works 40 hours a week, so:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1,000 \]

Janet makes $1,000 every week.

Finally, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for Janet to save $2,000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs by the amount she makes each week:

- He bought 3 peaches. Each peach costs $0.50. So, 3 peaches cost 3 * $0.50 = $1.50.
- He bought 4 pears. Each pear costs $0.50. So, 4 pears cost 4 * $0.50 = $2.00.
- He bought 2 kiwis. Each kiwi costs $1.00. So, 2 kiwis cost 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.
- He bought 5 apples. Each apple costs $0.75. So, 5 apples cost 5 * $0.75 = $3.75.

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:
$1.50 (peaches) + $2.00 (pears) + $2.00 (kiwis) + $3.75 (apples) = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each. So, with $0.75, Jamaar can buy:

Next, we need to find 5% of $126:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 126 = \frac{5}{100} \times 126 = 6.30 \]

So, after the second year, the price will be:
\[ 126 + 6.30 = 132.30 \]

Finally, we need to find 5% of $132.30:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 132.30 = \frac{5}{100} \times 132.30 = 6.615 \]

   72 \div 8 = 9
   \]
   So, each album has 9 pictures.

4. Now, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies and 2 of the albums are portraits.
5. To find out how many selfies there are, we multiply the number of selfie albums by the number of pictures in each album:
   \[
   3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies}

   \( 61 + 30 = 91 \)
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so we add 7 to 91:
   \( 91 + 7 = 98 \)

So, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to find out how many easy questions there are:**
   - The quiz has 60 questions in total.
   - 40% of the questions are easy.
   - To find 40% of 60, we do: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
   - So, there are 24 easy questions.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many average and difficult questions there are:**
   - The rest of the questions are not easy, so we subtract the easy questions from the total:
     - \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
   - These 36 questions are split equally between average and difficult questions.
   - So, there are 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

3. **Now, let's see how many questions Aries will get right:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions right.
     - To find 75% of 24, we do: \( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \)
     - So, Aries gets 18 easy questions right.
   - Aries gets half of the average questions right.
     - To find half of 18, we do: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)
     - So, Aries gets 9 average questions right.
   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions right.
     - To find half of 18, we do: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)
     - So, Aries gets 9 difficult questions right.

4. **Finally, we add up all the questions Aries gets right:**
   - Easy questions right: 18
   - Average questions right: 9
   - Difficult questions right: 9
   - Total questions right: \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)

So, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that Teresa sells small stuffed animals for $4 each. She also sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of the small ones, so that means each large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Today, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold \(x\) large stuffed animals. This means she sold \(2x\) small stuffed animals.

Now, we need to figure out how much money she made from selling these stuffed animals. The money from the small ones is \(4 \times 2x\), and the money from the large ones is \(12 \times x\).

The total money she made is:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Let's simplify that:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many sandwiches each person eats in a day:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches.

Now, let's add these up to find out how many sandwiches the whole family eats in one day:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of sandwiches they eat in one day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day × 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes.

- She sold 80 cookies for $1 each. So, 80 cookies × $1 = $80.
- She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each. So, 60 cupcakes × $4 = $240.

Now, let's add the money from the cookies and cupcakes to find out her total earnings:
- Total earnings = $80 + $240 = $320.

Next, we need to subtract the money she gave to her sisters:
- She gave $10 to each of her two sisters. So, 2 sisters × $10 = $20.

Finally, we subtract the $20 from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
- Money left = $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. So, together, they found:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, there were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found by anyone. So, the number of eggs that were found is:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by their friends is:
\[ 90 - 60 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the friends found 30 eggs.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine in one day with a steel pickaxe. 

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, 50% of 24 pounds is \(24 \times 0.5 = 12\) pounds. Adding that to 24 pounds, he can mine \(24 + 12 = 36\) pounds with a steel pickaxe.

Now, if one dwarf can mine 36 pounds in one day, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds in one day.

Finally, if 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds in one day, in 30 days they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. We have three different packages of sandwiches, and we need to find out how much the biggest package costs.

First, let's look at what we know:
- A package with 2 sandwiches costs $3.
- A package with 4 sandwiches costs $6.

Now, let's figure out how much each sandwich costs in these packages:
- For the package with 2 sandwiches: $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.
- For the package with 4 sandwiches: $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

So, each sandwich costs $1.50 no matter how many are in the package.

Now, we need to find out how much a package with 8 sandwiches costs. Since each sandwich costs $1.50, we can calculate it like this:
- 8 sandwiches × $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Red Balloons:**
   - Sally started with 25 red balloons.
   - A gust of wind made 40% of them burst.
   - 40% of 25 is \( 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \).
   - So, 10 red balloons burst.
   - Red balloons left: \( 25 - 10 = 15 \).

2. **Yellow Balloons:**
   - Sally started with 12 yellow balloons.
   - She accidentally let go of half of them.
   - Half of 12 is \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \).
   - So, 6 yellow balloons were let go.
   - Yellow balloons left: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \).

3. **Green Balloons:**
   - Sally had 7 green balloons, and none of them burst or were let go.
   - Green balloons left: 7.

4. **Blue Balloons:**
   - Sally found 8 blue balloons in a tree.
   - She added 75% of them to her bunch.
   - 75% of 8 is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \).
   - So, she added 6 blue balloons.
   - Blue balloons added: 6.

5. **Total Balloons:**
   - Red balloons left: 15
   - Green balloons left: 7
   - Yellow balloons left: 6

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. That means there's a 50% chance he won't have to turn it in.

2. **Normal Teacher:**
   - If the normal teacher comes (which is the other 50% chance), there are two more things to think about:
     - There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give everyone an extension. So, 50% (chance of normal teacher) times 40% (chance of extension) equals 20%.
     - If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension (which is 60% of the time), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his homework. So, 50% (chance of normal teacher) times 60% (no extension) times 20% (dog ate it) equals 6%.

3. **Adding It All Up:**
   - The total chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is:
     - 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher gives extension) + 6% (dog ate it) = 76%.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - If there's a 76% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework, then there's a 100% - 76% = 24% chance he will have to turn it in.

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

   - The Fine Arts Center has 6000 seats in total.
   - 950 seats are for the graduates.
   - 300 seats are for the teachers.
   - So, the seats left for friends and family are: 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats.

2. Now, we need to divide these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates.
   - To find out how many tickets each graduate gets, we divide 4750 by 950.
   - 4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate gets 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

2. **Total Earnings:**
   Melissa gets $15 each day for 3 days.
   So, $15/day × 3 days = $45

3. **Total Expenses:**
   Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.
   So, $3/day × 3 days = $9

4. **Net Earnings:**
   To find out how much money Melissa has left after paying for parking, we subtract the total expenses from the total earnings.
   So, $45 - $9 = $36

5. **Hourly Rate After Expenses:**
   To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we divide the net earnings by the total hours.
   So, $36 ÷ 18 hours = $2

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses.

   - It takes him 35 seconds to move between all the bottles.

3. **Finally, we add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle.**
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he doesn't need extra time to get there.

2. **How much money did Jim lose by not working during college?**
   - Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 each year.
   - He didn't work for 4 years, so he lost \( 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \) dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to know how big the bed is. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.

Now, Jim wants the fabric to be a bit bigger than the bed. He wants it to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. So, we need to add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

For the length:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

For the width:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

So, each piece of fabric needs to be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

Next, we need to find out how much fabric is in one piece. We do this by multiplying the length by the width:
8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Jim needs two pieces of fabric, so we need to double this amount:
80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.

We have three people sharing $1920. Let's call the amount the first person gets ""x.""

The second person gets $80 more than the first person, so the second person gets ""x + 80.""

The third person gets twice what the second person gets, so the third person gets ""2 * (x + 80).""

Now, we add all these amounts together to get the total of $1920:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2 * (x + 80) = 1920 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Now, we need to find out what ""x"" is. We do this by subtracting 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to find ""x"":
\[ x = 1680 ÷ 4 \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person gets $420.

2. In the third set, he picked up half as many balls as in the second set.
3. He picked up 19 balls in total.

Let's use a simple letter to help us. Let's say \( x \) is the number of balls Rory picked up in the second set.

Now, let's write down what we know:
- In the first set, he picked up \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the second set, he picked up \( x \) balls.
- In the third set, he picked up \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

We also know that the total number of balls is 19. So, we can write this as:

2. To make it easier, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying everything by 2:
   \[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
   \[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

3. Now, let's add the \( x \) terms together:
   \[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

4. Next, we need to get \( x \) by itself. So, we subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[ 5x = 30 \]

5. Finally, we divide both sides by 5:
   \[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory picked up 6 balls in the second set. Now, we need to find out how many balls he picked up in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory picked up 10 balls in the first set.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007. Each year, the car loses 21% of its value. We need to find out how much the car is worth in 2010, which is 3 years later.

1. First, we need to find out how much the car loses in value each year. If the car is worth $20,000 and it loses 21% each year, we can calculate the loss for one year:
   \[
   20,000 \times 0.21 = 4,200
   \]
   So, the car loses $4,200 in value each year.

2. Now, we need to find out how much the car is worth after 3 years. We can do this by subtracting the loss for each year from the original price:
   - After the first year:
     \[
     20,000 - 4,200 = 15,800
     \]
   - After the second year:
     \[
     15,800 - 4,200 = 11,600
     \]
   - After the third year:
     \[
     11,600 - 4,200 = 7,400
     \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $7,400.

7400"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 50 books in total.
2. Half of these books are in English. So, 50 divided by 2 is 25. That means there are 25 English books.
3. Next, 10% of the books are in German. To find 10% of 50, we can think of it as 10 out of 100, which is the same as 5 out of 50. So, there are 5 German books.
4. Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we need to subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books. 

So, 50 - 25 (English) - 5 (German) = 20

There are 20 Spanish books.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that the total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. That's a really long trip!

Next, we need to figure out how far Bernice has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. So, we need to multiply 325 by 4:

\[ 325 \times 4 = 1300 \]

So, Bernice has driven 1300 kilometers so far.

Now, to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

\[ 1955 - 1300 = 655 \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days. She drinks 8 cups every day, so we multiply 8 by 30:
\[ 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many gallons that is. We know that 16 cups make 1 gallon. So, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
\[ 240 \div 16 = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. First, Romeo boards a train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people get on the train. So, we add 20 to 120:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (which is 100) get on. So, we subtract 50 and then add 100:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off the train. So, we subtract 80 from 190:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
110

"Okay, let's figure out how much Alison spent on her athletic gear step by step.

1. **Tank top**: Alison bought a tank top for $10.
2. **Running shorts**: The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top. So, $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis shoes**: The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. So, $48 ÷ 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic socks**: The socks cost $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off. So, $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on her athletic gear.

"To figure out how much it will cost to put new tiles on the kitchen floor, we need to do a few simple steps.

1. **Find out how many tiles we need:**
   - The kitchen floor is 200 square feet.
   - Each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, so each tile covers 1 square foot.
   - So, we need 200 tiles to cover the whole floor.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - If we need 200 tiles, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile.
   - \( 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \).

So, it will cost $2400 to renovate the kitchen floor.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we need to find out how much more James has to pay each month because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it went up by 60%.

2. To find 60% of $120, we can do this:
   \[
   120 \times 0.60 = 72
   \]
   So, the cost went up by $72.

3. Now, we add the extra $72 to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
   \[
   120 + 72 = 192
   \]
   So, James now pays $192 each month.

4. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   192 \times 12 = 2304
   \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for insurance.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **Twin Sheets:**
   - Greg needs to put clean sheets on 4 twin beds every week.
   - His washing machine can only wash 2 twin sheets at a time.
   - So, he needs to do:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sheets}}{2 \text{ sheets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets}
     \]

2. **King Sheet:**
   - Greg also needs to put clean sheets on 1 king bed every week.
   - His washing machine can only wash 1 king sheet at a time.
   - So, he needs to do:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king sheet}}{1 \text{ sheet per load}} = 1 \text{ load for the king sheet}
     \]

3. **Total Loads per Week:**
   - Adding the loads for twin sheets and the king sheet:
     \[
     2 \text{ loads for twin sheets} + 1 \text{ load for the king sheet} = 3 \text{ loads per week}
     \]

4. **Total Loads per Year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, the total number of loads in a year is:
     \[
     3 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks per year} = 156 \text{ loads per year}

1. **Movies on Saturday:**
   - Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies on Sunday:**
   - On Sunday, they watch half as many movies as they do on Saturday.
   - Half of 4 is 2, so they watch 2 movies on Sunday.

3. **Total movies in one weekend:**
   - On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
   - So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

4. **Total movies in 4 weeks:**
   - They watch 6 movies each weekend.
   - Over 4 weeks, they watch 6 movies per weekend × 4 weekends = 24 movies.

So, in 4 weeks, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies.

First, let's find out how much food all the cats eat in one meal:
- 3 cats * 60 grams/cat = 180 grams per meal

Next, let's find out how much food all the cats eat in one day:
- 180 grams per meal * 2 meals/day = 360 grams per day

Now, we have 720 grams of cat food. We need to find out how many days this will last:

2. **Now, let's figure out how many slices each person ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Finally, let's add up all the slices they ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan. The whole meal took 98 minutes.

First, let's say Donovan took \( D \) minutes to make his part. That means Betsy took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

Now, if we add the time Betsy and Donovan took, it should equal 98 minutes:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Let's simplify that:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to get \( D \) by itself. We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( D \):
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy took 18 minutes more than Donovan:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Hannah's doctor's visit costs. We need to add up all the different parts:

1. The cast costs $200.
2. The doctor's visit is 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The doctor charges $300 for each hour, so for half an hour, it's $300 divided by 2, which is $150.
3. Hannah gets 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4. So, 30 pills times $4 is $120.
4. The parking costs $6 for each hour, and she has to park for at least 2 hours. So, 2 hours times $6 is $12.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
- Cast: $200
- Visit: $150
- Painkillers: $120
- Parking: $12

Total cost: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

James gets 80 emails every day. But not all of these emails need a response. Only 80 out of every 100 emails need a response because 20 out of every 100 emails don't need a response.

To find out how many emails need a response, we can do this:
1. First, we find out what 20% of 80 is. We do this by multiplying 80 by 20 and then dividing by 100:
   \[
   80 \times 20 = 1600
   \]
   \[
   1600 \div 100 = 16
   \]
   So, 16 emails don't need a response.

2. Now, we subtract the 16 emails that don't need a response from the total 80 emails:
   \[
   80 - 16 = 64
   \]
   So, 64 emails need a response each day.

3. James works 5 days a week. To find out how many emails he responds to in a week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
   \[
   64 \times 5 = 320

First, the glee club:
- They ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them. To find out how many they ate, we can think of 70% as 70 out of 100, or 0.70.
- So, 20 pizzas times 0.70 equals 14 pizzas eaten.
- That means they have 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

Next, the football team:
- They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club. So, 20 pizzas times 2 equals 40 pizzas.
- They ate 80% of them. Again, 80% is 80 out of 100, or 0.80.
- So, 40 pizzas times 0.80 equals 32 pizzas eaten.
- That means they have 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

Now, let's add the pizzas left by both groups:
- Glee club has 6 pizzas left.
- Football team has 8 pizzas left.
- Together, they have 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left.

So, the total number of pizzas left is 14."

4. Now, we add the costs of the small and big coupons to find the total cost:
   \[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

5. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:

First, we need to find out how many trucks had problems:
- If 1 out of every 4 trucks had a problem, then \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 20 trucks had problems.
- \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) trucks had problems.

Next, we need to find out how many trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser:
- Total trucks sent out: 20
- Trucks with problems: 5
- Trucks that delivered: 20 - 5 = 15 trucks

Now, we need to find out how much fertiliser these 15 trucks delivered:
- Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser.

2. **Now, let's look at the store's promotion:**
   - The store has a deal: ""Buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every pound of butter you buy at full price, you get the next pound at half price.

   - The full price of one pound of butter is $4.00.
   - For the first pound, Dennis pays $4.00.
   - For the second pound, he pays half of $4.00, which is $2.00.
   - For the third pound, he pays $4.00 again.
   - For the fourth pound, he pays $2.00.
   - For the fifth pound, he pays $4.00.

- Each burger platter costs $11.
- So, the total from burger platters is 9 times $11, which is $99.00.

Then, we calculate the money from the sodas:
- Terry sells 20 sodas.
- Each soda costs $1.50.
- So, the total from sodas is 20 times $1.50, which is $30.00.

Now, we add up all the money:
- Total from milkshakes: $33.00
- Total from burger platters: $99.00
- Total from sodas: $30.00

So, the total money Terry makes is $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00.

"Okay, let's figure out how long Paul has to wait for his train. We'll break it down step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - The first train arrives in 10 minutes.
   - It stays at the station for 20 minutes.
   - So, the first train leaves 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - So, the second train leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 145 minutes.

"Melanie has been saving toothpicks for her sculpture. She saves 10 toothpicks every week. She has been doing this for 12 weeks already. So, let's see how many toothpicks she has:

10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks is:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

The sculpture needs 200 toothpicks. So, she still needs:
\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

If she keeps saving 10 toothpicks each week, to find out how many more weeks she needs, we do:
\[ 80 \div 10 = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Melanie needs 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. The watch originally costs $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought it for 75% of the original price. To find 75% of $2000, we do:
   \[
   2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]
   So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

3. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend for 120% of what he paid. To find 120% of $1500, we do:
   \[
   1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]
   So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for $1800.

4. Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price. The original price was $2000, and his friend paid $1800. The discount is:
   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]

5. To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
   \[
   \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend got a 10% discount from the original price.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to figure out how many seconds are in 4 hours. We know that:
- 1 hour has 60 minutes.
- 1 minute has 60 seconds.

So, to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours, we do:
4 hours × 60 minutes/hour × 60 seconds/minute = 14,400 seconds

Next, we know that one spring makes 1 jellyfish every second. So, in 14,400 seconds, one spring would make 14,400 jellyfish.

Now, if we have 5 springs, each making 14,400 jellyfish, we need to multiply:
5 springs × 14,400 jellyfish/spring = 72,000 jellyfish

So, 5 springs would make 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Binkie's score is 90. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. 

First, we need to find out what twice Binkie's score is:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we add 15 to 180 to get Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. James starts walking to the store, which is 4 miles away.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. Then he realizes he forgot something and has to walk back home. So he walks another 2 miles back home.
4. Now, he has to walk the full 4 miles to the store again.

So, let's add up all the miles he walked:
- 2 miles to the halfway point
- 2 miles back home
- 4 miles to the store

That's a total of 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him, we divide the total distance by his speed:
- 8 miles ÷ 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny got. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, we do:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much it would cost if Jenny bought each banana separately. Each banana costs $0.80, so:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's see how much it cost Jenny to buy the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, and she bought 10 bunches, so:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence to share. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. We need to find out how much fence Sam gets.

1. Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of fence.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of fence.
3. Together, they have 100 feet of fence, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   S + (S + 60) = 100
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2S + 60 = 100
   \]
5. Subtract 60 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
   \[
   2S = 40
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 20
   \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

So, the crocodile grows 2 inches each year.

Now, we want to know how much it will grow in 13 years. We multiply the growth per year by 13:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Marcel made from selling bikes. I'll break it down step by step.

1. **Total bikes sold**: Marcel sold 300 bikes in one month.

2. **Trekking bikes**:
   - Half of the bikes were Trekking bikes.
   - So, \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.

3. **BMX bikes**:
   - 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes.
   - So, \( 15\% \) of 300 is \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.

4. **MTB bikes**:
   - The rest of the bikes were MTB bikes.
   - So, \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

5. **Price of each type of bike**:
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: Half the price of an MTB, so \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars
   - Trekking: $450

6. **Total earnings from each type of bike**:
   - Earnings from MTB: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars
   - Earnings from BMX: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars
   - Earnings from Trekking: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars

7. **Total earnings**:
   - Add up all the earnings: \( 52,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = 131,250 \) dollars

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we need to figure out how many bales the farmer makes in one hour. The farmer makes 5 bales each hour.
2. Next, we need to find out how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours. We do this by multiplying the number of bales made in one hour by the number of hours:
   \[
   5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}
   \]
3. Now, we need to figure out how many bales the truck picks up in one hour. The truck picks up 3 bales each hour.
4. Then, we need to find out how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours. We do this by multiplying the number of bales picked up in one hour by the number of hours:
   \[
   3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}
   \]
5. Finally, we need to find out how many bales are left in the field. We do this by subtracting the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
   \[
   30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales}
   \]

So, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to find out how many classes John has in a week. He has 6 classes each day, plus 2 extra classes. So, each day he has:

\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes} \]

He goes to school 5 days a week, so the total number of classes in a week is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ classes/week} \]

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time he spends in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ classes/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, John also spends some extra time learning on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on each of these days. So, the extra time he spends each day is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the extra weekend time to the regular class time to get the total time he spends learning each week:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To find out how many hours this is, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

1. **First, we need to know how high the ball is dropped from:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third floor.
   - Each floor is 24 feet high.
   - So, the ball is dropped from \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how high the ball bounces after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height.
   - So, after the first bounce, the ball goes up to \( 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \) feet.

3. **Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces after the second bounce:**
   - Again, the ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its height after the first bounce.
   - So, after the second bounce, the ball goes up to \( 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \) feet.

So, the ball goes up to 32 feet on its second bounce.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, if the triceratops had \( x \) kilograms of meat, the T-Rex ate \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms, and there was \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms left.

2. Then, the velociraptors came and ate half of what was left. So, they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( \frac{x}{2} \), which is \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means there was \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms left after the velociraptors.

3. Finally, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms. So, \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

4. To find out how much the triceratops weighed before the T-Rex ate, we need to solve for \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to paint the room. First, we need to find out how much area we need to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.

Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.

Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
40 square feet * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add up the total area of all four walls:
160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Next, we need to figure out how many gallons of paint we need. One gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. So, the number of gallons we need is:
240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

Finally, we need to find out how much it will cost. Each gallon of paint costs $12. So, the total cost is:
12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

So, it will cost $144 to paint the room.

Imagine two toy trains starting from the same spot and going in opposite directions. One train is super fast and goes 60 miles every hour. The other train is a bit slower and goes 30 miles every hour.

Now, if both trains run for 3 hours, we need to figure out how far apart they are.

First, let's see how far the fast train goes:
- Fast train: 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

Next, let's see how far the slow train goes:
- Slow train: 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

Since they are going in opposite directions, we add the distances together to find out how far apart they are:
- Total distance apart: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

2. **Calculate the days Billy takes off:**
   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.
   - 20% of 50 days is 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

3. **Find out how many days Billy works:**
   - Total days minus the days off: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

4. **Calculate how many people Billy helps each day:**
   - Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day.
   - So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

We have two big slides at Five Flags. The first one is really long, 300 feet, and you go down it at 60 feet every minute. The second one is a bit shorter, 240 feet, but you go down it faster, at 80 feet every minute.

First, let's figure out how long it takes to go down each slide.

For the first slide:
- It's 300 feet long.
- You go 60 feet every minute.
- So, to find out how many minutes it takes, we divide 300 by 60.
- 300 ÷ 60 = 5 minutes.

For the second slide:
- It's 240 feet long.
- You go 80 feet every minute.
- So, to find out how many minutes it takes, we divide 240 by 80.
- 240 ÷ 80 = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes to go down the first slide compared to the second slide:
- The first slide takes 5 minutes.
- The second slide takes 3 minutes.

3. Next, we add the lunch time to the break time:
   - 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

4. Since 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour on breaks and lunch each day.

5. Now, we need to find out how much time he spends on breaks and lunch over 5 days:
   - 1 hour per day * 5 days = 5 hours.

   Now, her balance is $70.00.

3. Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the sale price, we need to calculate 20% of $20.00 and then subtract it from $20.00:

3. We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means that 6 jellyfish are the ones that change color from green to blue.

Now, let's figure out how many large jellyfish there are:
- If 6 jellyfish change color, and this is a third of the large jellyfish, then the total number of large jellyfish is 6 times 3 (because 6 is one-third of the total large jellyfish).
- So, the total number of large jellyfish is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

Next, we need to find out how many jellyfish are in the tank in total:
- We know that the large jellyfish are a fifth of the total jellyfish. So, if 18 jellyfish are a fifth of the total, then the total number of jellyfish is 18 times 5 (because 18 is one-fifth of the total).
- So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 18 \times 5 = 90 \).

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First, we need to find out how much money Lauren needs each year for retirement.**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary.
   - Her current salary is $100,000.
   - So, 40% of $100,000 is \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \).

2. **Next, we need to find out how much money Lauren needs for 20 years of retirement.**
   - She needs $40,000 each year.
   - For 20 years, she needs \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \).

3. **Now, we need to find out how much money Lauren saves each year.**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her salary.
   - Her salary is $100,000.
   - So, 20% of $100,000 is \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \).

4. **Finally, we need to find out how many years it will take for Lauren to save $800,000.**
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - To save $800,000, she needs \( 800,000 \div 20,000 = 40 \) years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

We know that 40% of the school is boys, and there are 240 boys. We need to find out how many students are in the whole school first.

1. **Find the total number of students:**
   - If 40% of the school is 240 boys, we can set up a simple equation:
     \[
     0.40 \times \text{Total Students} = 240
     \]
   - To find the total number of students, we divide 240 by 0.40:
     \[
     \text{Total Students} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600
     \]

2. **Find the number of girls:**
   - Now that we know there are 600 students in total, and 240 of them are boys, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
     \[
     \text{Number of Girls} = 600 - 240 = 360

First, let's add up the total height of all the heels:
- Three women with 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
- Three women with 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches

Now, let's add these together to get the total height:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches

Next, we need to find the average height. To do this, we divide the total height by the number of women:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. She plans to walk 125 miles twice a day. 

First, let's find out how many miles she will walk each day:
125 miles + 125 miles = 250 miles per day

Next, let's see how many miles she will walk in the whole month:
250 miles/day × 30 days = 7,500 miles

Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to walk to reach 9,300 miles:
9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

To find out how many more miles she needs to walk each day, we divide the extra miles by the number of days in June:
1,800 miles ÷ 30 days = 60 miles

So, Soledad needs to walk 60 more miles each day to reach her goal.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money the store will make from selling all the red balls:
- There are 3 red balls.
- Each red ball costs $9.
- So, the total money from red balls is 3 times 9, which is 27 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the money from the blue balls:
- There are 11 blue balls.
- Each blue ball costs $5.
- So, the total money from blue balls is 11 times 5, which is 55 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much money the store will make from the green balls:
- There are 25 green balls.
- Each green ball costs $3.
- So, the total money from green balls is 25 times 3, which is 75 dollars.

Finally, we add up all the money from the red, blue, and green balls:
- Total money = 27 dollars (from red balls) + 55 dollars (from blue balls) + 75 dollars (from green balls)
- Total money = 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 dollars

So, the store will have received 157 dollars after all the balls are sold.

Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of the apples, and Paul wants a third of the apples. We need to find out how many kilograms of apples Jacques will have left.

First, let's figure out how many kilograms Pierre gets:
- A quarter of 12 kg is \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) kg.

Next, let's figure out how many kilograms Paul gets:
- A third of 12 kg is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) kg.

Now, let's add up how many kilograms Pierre and Paul take together:
- Pierre takes 3 kg, and Paul takes 4 kg, so together they take \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) kg.

Finally, we subtract the total amount Pierre and Paul take from the total amount of apples to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left:
- Jacques will have \( 12 - 7 = 5 \) kg left.

So, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

First, we need to figure out how far John drives one way to visit his parents. We know that he drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he drives for a round trip. Since he drives 140 miles to get there and 140 miles to get back, the round trip is:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} + 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we need to find out how many miles he drives in a month. For two visits:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John drives 560 miles in a month when visiting his parents.

   - So, each worker makes \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
   - Since there are 2 workers, they make \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys together.

2. **Next, let's see how many toys the other two workers made:**
   - Each of these workers makes 4 toys every hour.
   - They also work for 10 hours.
   - So, each worker makes \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
   - Since there are 2 workers, they make \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys together.

3. **Now, let's add up the toys made by these four workers:**
   - The first two workers made 120 toys.
   - The other two workers made 80 toys.
   - Together, they made \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

4. **The toy company needs 400 toys, but they still need 20 more toys:**

   - Divide by 2: \( S = 9 \).

4. **Finding How Many Camden Painted:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Finding How Many Arnold and Madeline Painted:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let's say Arnold painted \( A \) eggs.
   - Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted \( 2A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs.

2. **Sidewalk Walking:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.
   - If she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach, she walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Time on the beach: 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes.
   - Total time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete her entire 3-mile walk.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Jane saves $4 every week. She has been saving for 8 weeks already. So, let's find out how much she has saved so far:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Jane wants to save a total of $60. We need to find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we need to figure out how many more weeks it will take her to save $28:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"Okay, let's count the blue birds in the trees step by step:

1. First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. So, we do:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21

   That means there are 21 blue birds in these 3 trees.

2. Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. So, we do:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
   That means there are 8 blue birds in these 2 trees.

3. Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds. So, we do:
   \[
   1 \times 3 = 3
   \]
   That means there are 3 blue birds in this tree.

Now, we add all the blue birds together:
\[
21 + 8 + 3 = 32

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

First, we know that if Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Now, 2 dozen is the same as 24 marbles (because 1 dozen is 12 marbles).

So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before he gets those 24 marbles, he must have:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]
So, Bob has 36 marbles right now.

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the 36 marbles he has:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other mug is a mystery temperature. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the mystery mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is warm enough for him to drink, which means it's at least 40 degrees.

To find out how warm the mystery mug is, we need to figure out what temperature the water in the bottle must be after mixing.

1. First, let's think about the total amount of water in the bottle. Donny poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the mystery mug, so there are 5 ounces of water in total.

2. The water in the bottle needs to be at least 40 degrees. We can use a simple formula to find out the temperature of the mystery mug. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{Final Temperature} = \frac{(\text{Amount from 33-degree mug} \times 33) + (\text{Amount from mystery mug} \times \text{Mystery Temperature})}{\text{Total Amount of Water}}
   \]

3. Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   40 = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times \text{Mystery Temperature})}{5}
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   40 = \frac{132 + \text{Mystery Temperature}}{5}
   \]

5. To get rid of the 5, multiply both sides by 5:
   \[
   200 = 132 + \text{Mystery Temperature}
   \]

6. Now, solve for the Mystery Temperature:
   \[
   \text{Mystery Temperature} = 200 - 132
   \]
   \[
   \text{Mystery Temperature} = 68
   \]

So, the water in the mystery mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixed water.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **Starting with the cows:**
   - Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows.
   - Every day, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 more cows.
   - This happens for 3 weeks, which is 21 days.
   - So, the number of cows added is 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows.
   - Total cows after 3 weeks: 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

2. **Now for the chickens:**
   - Melanie's dad starts with 20 chickens.
   - Every day, Broilers Limited brings 10 more chickens.
   - This also happens for 3 weeks, which is 21 days.
   - So, the number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens.
   - Total chickens after 3 weeks: 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

3. **Adding the cows and chickens together:**
   - Total animals on the farm after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to know how much 4 packs of bagels cost without any discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is buying 4 packs. So, we do:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]
That means 4 packs cost $40.00.

Next, Russell gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $40.00:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]
So, the discount is $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Russell actually pays:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]
So, Russell pays $36.00 for 4 packs of bagels.

Each pack has 9 bagels, and Russell bought 4 packs. To find out how many bagels he has in total, we do:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]
So, Russell has 36 bagels.

Finally, to find out how much each bagel costs, we divide the total amount Russell paid by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]
So, each bagel costs $1.00.

The cost of each bagel is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]
Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, we do:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]
This means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a simple multiplication problem:
\[ \text{If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then how many potatoes make 18 scoops?} \]
We can solve this by finding out how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]
So, there are 9 groups of 2 scoops in 18 scoops. Since each group of 2 scoops needs 3 potatoes, we multiply:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Chester eats 3 eggs every day for 30 days. So, we need to find out how many eggs that is:
3 eggs/day × 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, Chester starts eating 5 eggs every day for the next 30 days. So, we need to find out how many eggs that is:
5 eggs/day × 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs:
240 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

To find out how many men and women there are, we can divide the total number of people by 14:
84 ÷ 14 = 6

This means there are 6 groups of 14 people on the bus. Now, we can find out how many men and women there are:
- Number of men: 5 × 6 = 30
- Number of women: 9 × 6 = 54

Next, we need to find out how many women are left after 20 women get off the bus:

\[ 26 \div 2 = 13 \]
So, Faraday sells 13 individual sunflowers each day.

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets he sells each day. He earns $56 from selling bouquets that cost $8 each. So, we divide 56 by 8:
\[ 56 \div 8 = 7 \]
So, Faraday sells 7 bouquets each day.

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. So, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets he sells each day is:
\[ 7 \times 12 = 84 \]
So, Faraday sells 84 sunflowers in bouquets each day.

Now, we add the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold each day:
\[ 13 + 84 = 97 \]
So, Faraday sells 97 sunflowers each day.

Finally, we need to find out how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days. We multiply the number of sunflowers sold each day by 3:

   - Lamar found 5 eggs.
   - Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
   - Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
   - Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

3. **Total Eggs Found:**
   - Add up all the eggs found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

4. **Eggs Still Hidden:**
   - Subtract the total eggs found from the total eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the third building. The first two buildings each have 200 apartments, so together they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third building is 60% bigger than the first two combined. To find 60% of 400, we do:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]

So, the third building has:
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's add up all the apartments John collects garbage from:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections he makes in a week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 for each collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes:
\[ 1248 \]"

1. **5-year-old tree**: It makes 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: It makes 3 times as many fruits as the 5-year-old tree. So, 3 times 50 is 150 fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: It makes 7 times as many fruits as the 5-year-old tree. So, 7 times 50 is 350 fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: It makes 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. We'll figure out the 10-year-old tree first.
5. **9-year-old tree**: It doesn't make any fruits at all. So, 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: It makes 20 times as many fruits as the 5-year-old tree. So, 20 times 50 is 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree makes:
- The 10-year-old tree makes 1000 fruits.
- The 8-year-old tree makes 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, 1000 - 200 is 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits from each year:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class!

First, we know that the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope. So if the blue rope is 1 centimeter, the red rope would be 4 centimeters. But we don't know the exact length of the blue rope yet, so let's call it ""B"" centimeters.

Next, we know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. So if the blue rope is ""B"" centimeters, the yellow rope is ""B + 7"" centimeters.

Now, we know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So we can write this as:
\[ \text{Red rope} + \text{Blue rope} + \text{Yellow rope} = 37 \]
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Let's add up all the parts:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Now, we need to find out what ""B"" is. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long. Now, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[ \text{Red rope} = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa got \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
3. Both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount of money to their little sister. Let's call this amount \(x\).
4. After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
5. The problem says that Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. So, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[
15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
\]

\[
15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5}
\]

\[
15 - x = \frac{60}{5}
\]

\[
15 - x = 12
\]

\[
x = 15 - 12
\]

\[
x = 3
\]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister.

Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left:

\[
\text{Ronnie's remaining money} = 5 - 3 = 2
\]

So, Ronnie is left with \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. The mural is made up of four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.

3. The other half of the mural is split equally among red, white, and purple. So, the remaining paint is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]
4. Since red, white, and purple are used in equal amounts, each color gets:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Bedrooms:**
   - Each bedroom is 20 feet long and 12 feet wide.
   - To find the area of one bedroom, we multiply the length by the width:
     \[
     20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
     \]
   - Tom has 4 bedrooms, so we multiply the area of one bedroom by 4:
     \[
     240 \times 4 = 960 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Living Room:**
   - The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
   - So, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5:
     \[
     240 \times 5 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
     \]

3. **Rest of the House:**
   - The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

4. **Total Area:**
   - To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
     \[
     960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}

On Wednesday, she saw double Tuesday's, so 6 x 2 = 12 puffs.
On Thursday, she saw double Wednesday's, so 12 x 2 = 24 puffs.
On Friday, she saw double Thursday's, so 24 x 2 = 48 puffs.

Now, let's add them all up:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, Alice counted 93 puffs of clouds in total from Monday to Friday.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First, we need to find out how many pods are in the special box:**
   - A regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is 20 (because 20% means 20 out of 100).
   - So, the special box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

2. **Next, we need to find out how much each pod costs in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12.
   - There are 120 pods in the special box.
   - To find the cost of one pod, we divide the total cost by the number of pods: $12 ÷ 120 = $0.10 per pod.

3. **Now, we need to find out how many pods we can get for $1:**
   - Each pod costs $0.10.
   - To find out how many pods we can get for $1, we divide $1 by the cost of one pod: $1 ÷ $0.10 = 10 pods.

4. **Finally, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles we can run with 10 pods:**
   - Since we use 1 pod per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

So, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.**
   - To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20.
   - \( 1000 \div 20 = 50 \)
   - So, Thomas has 50 $20 bills.

2. **He loses 10 of these $20 bills.**
   - If he loses 10 bills, we subtract 10 from 50.
   - \( 50 - 10 = 40 \)
   - Now, Thomas has 40 $20 bills left.

3. **He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.**
   - Half of 40 is 20.
   - \( 40 \div 2 = 20 \)
   - So, he uses 20 $20 bills to pay for the bill.
   - After paying, he has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) $20 bills left.

4. **Thomas then triples his money.**
   - Each $20 bill is worth $20, so 20 $20 bills are worth \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.
   - Tripling $400 means multiplying by 3.
   - \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \)
   - Now, Thomas has $1200.

5. **He converts all his money to $5 bills.**
   - To find out how many $5 bills he gets, we divide $1200 by $5.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A. So, Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(8 \div 4 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)

2. **What happened on Monday?**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk.
   - To find out how much chalk was used, we do: \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday.

3. **How much chalk is left after Monday?**
   - We subtract the used chalk from the total: \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.
   - So, 2.75 inches of chalk are left after Monday.

4. **What happens each day after Monday?**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - This means 80% of the chalk is left each day.

5. **Let's see how much chalk is left each day:**
   - **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
     - Remaining chalk: \( 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.

     - Remaining chalk: \( 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

6. **When does the teacher need to recycle the chalk?**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - After 1 day, the chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days, the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

So, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

So, 3 boys are on the varsity team.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on the varsity team to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]
So, 7 students are on the varsity team.

To find out how many students are not on the varsity team, we subtract the number of students on the varsity team from the total number of students in the class. There are 12 girls and 12 boys, so the total number of students is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the number of students on the varsity team from the total number of students:
\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \]

So, the number of students not on the varsity team is 17.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. So, if Colin is \( C \) years old now, in seven years he will be \( C + 7 \) years old. Wendy is five times that age, so:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. Next, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, in 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old, and that age is a third of Wendy's current age \( W \). So:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

3. Now, let's use the first equation to find \( W \):
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)

4. Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7)

5. Simplify the right side:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)

   3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
   \]

7. Expand both sides:
   \[
   3C + 75 = 5C + 35

8. Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
   \[
   75 = 2C + 35

9. Subtract 35 from both sides:
   \[
   40 = 2C

   - So, they lost 28 bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack of bandages, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
   - They ordered two packs of 50 bandages each, so they got 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - So, they gained 100 - 25 = 75 bandages.

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total change over the three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, to find out how many bandages they started with, we need to subtract the total change from the final number of bandages:
78 - 59 = 19

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much the hair color costs. The color costs $40.
2. Next, we need to find out how much the haircut costs. May's hair was 10 inches long, and it was cut to 8 inches. So, the hair was cut by:
   \[
   10 - 8 = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. The cost of the haircut is $30 for each inch cut. So, for 2 inches, the cost is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Now, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut to get the total cost:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total cost of May's cut and color is:
\[
100

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will get for April.

1. **How much Jen earns in a day:**
   - Jen works for 7.5 hours each day.
   - She gets $1.5 for each hour.
   - So, her daily pay is 7.5 hours * $1.5/hour = $11.25.

2. **How much Jen earns in a week:**
   - Jen works 6 days a week.
   - Her weekly pay is 6 days * $11.25/day = $67.5.

3. **How much Jen earns in a month:**
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - Her monthly pay is 4 weeks * $67.5/week = $270.

4. **Adding the attendance bonus:**
   - Jen gets an extra $10 for not missing any days.
   - So, her total pay for April is $270 + $10 = $280.

Jen will receive $280 in April.

"Okay, let's see how much Jason made. 

He did his laundry once, so he gets $3.00.
He cleaned his room once, so he gets $1.50.
He took the trash out twice, so he gets $0.75 each time, which is $1.50 in total.
He emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so he gets $0.50 each time, which is $3.00 in total.

Now, let's add it all up:
$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishes) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in the two weeks.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. First, we know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood.
2. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale. So, if a whale has 40 gallons, a shark has:
   \[
   40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. If one shark has 120 gallons, then ten sharks have:
   \[
   120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:
\[
\boxed{1200}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. In the morning, 50 people came to the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people came.
3. Later, twice as many people as those who came at 10:00 came for lunch. That's \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, three times as many people as those who came in the morning came. That's \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, let's add all these people together:

\[
50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is:

320"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

2. She also bought twice as many packs of black pens as red pens. So, she bought:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
   \]
   Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens. So, the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

3. Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
   \[
   25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}
   \]

So, Alain has 75 pens in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John bought 10 bottles for $600. So, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
\[ 600 \div 10 = 60 \]
So, each bottle of scotch costs $60.

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac. That means he buys:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]
So, he buys 20 bottles of cognac.

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. To find out how much more, we calculate 50% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.5 = 30 \]
So, each bottle of cognac costs:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]
Each bottle of cognac costs $90.

Now, we need to find out how much John spends on all the bottles of cognac. We multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:
\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \]
So, John spends $1800 on cognac.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \]

So, John spends a total of $2400 on everything.

"Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, so that's 20 times 2, which equals 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 plus 10, which is 30 White Oak trees on the second day.

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than he did on the first day. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10. That means he planted 40 plus 10, which is 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted:
- White Oak trees: 20 on the first day and 30 on the second day, so 20 plus 30 equals 50 White Oak trees.
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 on the first day and 50 on the second day, so 40 plus 50 equals 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted is 50 White Oak trees plus 90 Lodgepole Pine trees, which equals 140 trees.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in primary school.

The problem says: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40.""

First, let's break it down:
- ""Four times the number of coffee mugs"" means we multiply the number of coffee mugs by 4.
- ""Eight more than"" means we add 8 to that number.
- The result is 40.

So, if we let the number of coffee mugs be \( x \), we can write the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
1. First, we need to get rid of the 8 on the left side. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
   \[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
   \[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Next, we need to find out what \( x \) is. We do this by dividing both sides by 4:
   \[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
   \[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're doing a math problem in class!

1. First, we need to find out how many fish have red stripes. The problem says one-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we need to divide the total number of fish by 3:
   - Total fish = 66
   - Fish with red stripes = 66 ÷ 3 = 22

2. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after we take out the ones with red stripes:
   - Remaining fish = 66 - 22 = 44

3. Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. The problem says 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we need to multiply the remaining fish by 5/11:
   - Fish with blue stripes = 44 × (5 ÷ 11) = 44 × 5 ÷ 11 = 220 ÷ 11 = 20

4. Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total:
   - Total fish with red or blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to figure out how many eyeshadow colors Amy had at the start.

1. Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes, and each palette had 4 colors. So, for the palettes:
   \[
   2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
   \]

2. Amy also had 3 makeup sets, and each set had 6 colors. So, for the makeup sets:
   \[
   3 \text{ makeup sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
   \]

3. Now, we add the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets to find the total number of colors Amy had at the start:
   \[
   8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from makeup sets} = 26 \text{ colors}
   \]

Next, we need to figure out how many colors Amy has left after her sister steals one palette and she uses up half of the colors from one makeup set.

1. Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, we subtract 4 colors:
   \[
   26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
   \]

2. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of 6 colors is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
   \]

3. We subtract these 3 colors from the remaining total:
   \[
   22 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors} = 19 \text{ colors}
   \]

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall. That's how big he is from his toes to the top of his head.
2. His house is 7 times as tall as he is. So, we need to multiply 60 inches by 7 to find out how tall the house is:
   \[
   60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the house is 420 inches tall from the ground to the very top of the roof.

3. The first floor of the house is 3 times as tall as Mattison. So, we need to multiply 60 inches by 3 to find out how tall the first floor is:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the first floor is 180 inches tall from the ground to the ceiling.

4. To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
   \[
   420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the roof is 240 inches high from the second floor's floor.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that there were 700 shells in total. The Alphas found 40% of these shells. To find out how many shells the Alphas found, we can do this:

40% of 700 = 0.40 × 700 = 280 shells

So, the Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after the Alphas found theirs. We do this by subtracting the number of shells the Alphas found from the total number of shells:

700 - 280 = 420 shells

Now, the Finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find out how many shells the Finders found, we can do this:

60% of 420 = 0.60 × 420 = 252 shells

So, the Finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells the Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by the Alphas and the Finders from the total number of shells:

700 - 280 - 252 = 168 shells

So, the Gogetters found 168 shells.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

Bernie has 4 dogs, and on average, each dog needs to walk 3 miles a day. That means all 4 dogs together need to walk:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know how far the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

If we add these up:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

So, the first three dogs together walk 8 miles. To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles the first three dogs walk from the total miles all four dogs need to walk:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

First, we need to find out how much money John got from the loan. His house is worth $250,000, and he got a loan for 40% of that. 

To find 40% of $250,000, we do:
\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John got $100,000 from the loan.

Next, we need to find out how much of that $100,000 he used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan to pay off his debts.

To find 60% of $100,000, we do:
\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, John used $60,000 to pay off his debts.

Now, we need to find out how much money he has left after paying off his debts. We subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount:

56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Next, we need to find out how much money Deandre will make. We know that 1 kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. So, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
128 kilograms * $0.50 per kilogram = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

3. To make it easier, let's break it down:
   \[
   72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to figure out how much water the dehumidifier removes on each setting:

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water each day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the low setting is \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water each day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the medium setting is \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water each day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the high setting is \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we add up all the water removed from each setting:
\[ 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \]

So, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is:

2. **John's School:**
   - John has two classes.
   - Each of John's classes can hold 1/8 of the number of students in Ali's class.
   - First, we need to find out how many students can fit in one of John's classes:

   - Since John has two classes, we need to multiply the number of students in one class by 2:
     - 15 students/class × 2 classes = 30 students.

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - Now, we add the number of students that both schools can hold:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to find out how much space the jar can hold.** The jar is like a big box, and we know it's 6 inches wide, 6 inches long, and 15 inches tall. To find out how much space it can hold, we multiply these numbers together:
   \[
   6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Next, we need to think about how much of that space the jelly beans actually take up.** Tim knows that the jelly beans only fill up about 80% of the space because they don't pack perfectly. So, we take 80% of 540 cubic inches:
   \[
   540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Now, we need to figure out how many jelly beans can fit in that space.** Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches. To find out how many jelly beans fit, we divide the space by the size of one jelly bean:
   \[
   432 \div 0.15 = 2880 \text{ jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Tim thinks that 30% of the jelly beans are red.** To find out how many red jelly beans he thinks there are, we take 30% of 2880:
   \[
   2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \text{ red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Finally, we need to see how close Tim's guess was to the real number.** The real number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim was, we subtract his guess from the real number:
   \[
   900 - 864 = 36

   - For 5 years, she spends 5 years × $6/year = $30.

2. **Next, let's find out the new cost of a visit after 5 years:**
   - The cost of one visit goes up by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is 1.5 × $2 = $3.
   - So, the new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.

3. **Now, let's find out how much Pauline spends in the next 3 years:**
   - Pauline still visits the museum 3 times each year.
   - Each visit now costs $5.
   - So, for one year, she spends 3 visits × $5/visit = $15.
   - For 3 years, she spends 3 years × $15/year = $45.

4. **Finally, let's add up all the money Pauline spent:**
   - For the first 5 years, she spent $30.
   - For the next 3 years, she spent $45.
   - So, the total amount she spent is $30 + $45 = $75.

So, Pauline spent a total of **$75** on all her visits to the museum."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many students are going to try the escape room. There are 10 students from each grade, and there are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th). So, we add them up:

10 students + 10 students + 10 students + 10 students = 40 students

Next, we need to know how many groups of 8 students we can make from these 40 students. We divide 40 by 8:

40 ÷ 8 = 5 groups

Each group gets 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, we need to find out how long it will take for all 5 groups to have their turn. We multiply the number of groups by the time each group gets:

5 groups × 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

225"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the wooden tables cost. John made 4 wooden tables, and each table costs $20. So, we multiply 4 by 20:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

Next, we need to find out how much the roof frames cost. John made 2 roof frames, and each frame costs $10. So, we multiply 2 by 10:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the frames together to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
$80 + $20 = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class.

Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces. One piece is 4 times longer than the other piece. We need to find out how long the longer piece is.

First, let's call the shorter piece ""x"" feet. The longer piece is 4 times longer, so it is 4x feet.

Now, if we add the lengths of the two pieces together, we get the total length of the board:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

This is the same as:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find out what \( x \) is, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times longer, so:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. We know that he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ 80 \div 16 = 5 \]

So, Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef to make 80 meatballs.

Next, we need to find out how much of his secret seasoning he will use. We know that he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound:

\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how wide all the windows are together. Each window is 35 inches wide, and there are 5 windows.
   - So, we do 35 inches times 5 windows: 
   - 35 x 5 = 175 inches

2. Now, Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows.
   - So, we do 175 inches times 2:
   - 175 x 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

"Okay, let's figure out how much a 36-minute call would cost from a payphone.

First, we need to know the cost for the first 16 minutes. The payphone charges $0.25 for each minute. So, for 16 minutes:
\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the call costs for the remaining minutes. After 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.20 per minute. The total call is 36 minutes, so the remaining minutes are:
\[ 36 - 16 = 20 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for these 20 minutes:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the costs of both parts of the call:
\[ 4.00 + 4.00 = 8.00 \]

So, a 36-minute call would cost $8.00.

First, we need to find out what twice the amount of rain on Monday is:
2 inches (Monday's rain) × 2 = 4 inches

Next, we add 1 more inch to that:
4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches

So, on Tuesday, it will rain 5 inches.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Next, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly makes is \( c \). Then the number of brownies she makes is:
\[ 3c - 2 \]

Now, we know the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 10. So, we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Combine like terms:
\[ c + 3c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

2. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 4c = 12 \]

3. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the manicure and pedicure cost together before the discount. The manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. So, we add these together:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, the salon gives a 20% discount if you get both. To find out how much the discount is, we need to calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants nail art on each of her fingers. She has 10 fingers, and the nail art costs $3 per nail. So, we multiply the number of nails by the cost per nail:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay:
\[ 90 \]

2. She also has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, for this magazine:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. Her last magazine sends 4 times as many issues as the 6-issue magazine. So, for this magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[
36 + 6 + 24 = 66

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Samantha has 27 paintings. The problem says Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has:
\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]
So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

Next, the problem tells us that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we take 8 away from Shelley's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Kim has:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **First, we start with the price of the toy in November.** The toy costs $40.

2. **In December, the price goes up by 80%.** To find out how much it goes up, we need to calculate 80% of $40.
   - 80% of $40 is \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - So, the price in December is \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

3. **In January, the price goes down by 50%.** To find out how much it goes down, we need to calculate 50% of $72.
   - 50% of $72 is \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - So, the price in January is \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to know how much Charlie makes from the regular lessons:
- He teaches 4 lessons at $80 each.
- So, \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much he makes from the lessons with veterans:
- He gives a 25% discount to veterans, so the price is 75% of $80.
- To find 75% of $80, we do \( 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \) dollars per lesson.
- He teaches 2 lessons to veterans, so \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the money from both types of lessons:
- Total money = Money from regular lessons + Money from veteran lessons
- Total money = \( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars.

So, Charlie will make 440 dollars for the day.

50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

So, the total of all her scores is 630.

Next, we need to count how many quizzes she took. She took 9 quizzes.

To find the mean score, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes:

630 ÷ 9 = 70

1. **Find out how many hours Michael travels in 3 days:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, in 3 days, Michael travels for \(24 \times 3 = 72\) hours.

2. **Calculate the total distance Michael travels:**
   - Michael travels at 50 km per hour.
   - In 72 hours, he travels \(50 \times 72 = 3600\) km.

3. **Find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) he has covered:**
   - To find the percentage, we use the formula: \(\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100\).
   - So, \(\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100\).

4. **Do the math:**

1. First, we need to know how much Bud spends each week on making macaroni and cheese.
   - The pasta costs $1.00.
   - The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
   - The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

2. Now, let's add up the costs for one week:
   - Pasta: $1.00
   - Cheddar cheese: $3.00
   - Gruyere cheese: $6.00
   - Total for one week: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

- The middle shelves: Each of the 2 middle shelves can hold 10 books. So, 2 shelves times 10 books each equals 20 books.
- The bottom shelf: This shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. So, 2 times 10 books equals 20 books.
- The top shelf: This shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. So, 20 books minus 5 books equals 15 books.

Now, let's add up all the books each bookcase can hold:
- Middle shelves: 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, each bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit in them. She makes some strawberry cubes and some blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, but 4 less than that. And she makes 116 ice cubes in total.

Let's call the number of strawberry cubes ""S"" and the number of blueberry cubes ""B.""

1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
   \[ B = 5S - 4 \]

2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   \[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, we can use the first equation to replace ""B"" in the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Let's add the S's together:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Now, we need to get rid of the -4. We do this by adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 6 to find S:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary made 20 strawberry cubes. Now, let's find out how many blueberry cubes she made. We use the first equation again:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]

Next, we need to find out how many phone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 people to come to the car shop. We know that for every 25 phone calls, 1 person comes to the shop. So, to get 30 people to come, Jason needs to make:

30 people × 25 phone calls per person = 750 phone calls

So, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls to sell 15 cars and get his bonus!

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, let's count the flashlights:
- Each person has 1 flashlight, and there are 4 people. So, 4 flashlights.
- Each room has 2 flashlights, and there are 8 rooms. So, 2 flashlights per room times 8 rooms equals 16 flashlights.
- Total flashlights: 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's count the candles:
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 small candles per room times 4 rooms equals 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. Again, half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 5 medium candles per room times 4 rooms equals 20 medium candles.
- Total candles: 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the flashlights and candles together:
- Total items: 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 items.

So, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Mitchell has two bags of chips. Each bag has 55 chips. So, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. We do this by adding the chips from both bags:

\[ 55 + 55 = 110 \]

Now, Mitchell's family has five people. We need to divide the total number of chips by the number of people to find out how many chips each person gets:

\[ 110 \div 5 = 22 \]

So, each person gets 22 chips.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class!

1. John takes 5 minutes to solve the first side of the Rubik's cube.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes 5 minutes × 2 = 10 minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes 5 minutes ÷ 2 = 2.5 minutes.
4. Once John solves the fifth side, the sixth side is automatically solved, so it doesn't add any extra time.

Now, let's add up all the time:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, it takes John 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know there are 20 helmets. That's a lot of helmets!

Now, the problem says there are half as many robots as helmets. So, if we have 20 helmets, we divide that by 2 to find the number of robots:
\[ 20 \div 2 = 10 \]
So, there are 10 robots.

Next, it says there are twice as many footballs as helmets. So, if we have 20 helmets, we multiply that by 2 to find the number of footballs:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
So, there are 40 footballs.

Now, we need to add up all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ robots} + 20 \text{ helmets} + 40 \text{ footballs} = 70 \text{ items} \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is:
70"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how many hours Tim works in a week. He works 6 hours each day, and he works 5 days a week. So, we multiply 6 hours by 5 days:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many minutes are in 30 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, we multiply 30 hours by 60 minutes:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that each call takes 15 minutes. To find out how many calls Tim can handle in 1800 minutes, we divide 1800 minutes by 15 minutes per call:
\[ 1800 \div 15 = 120 \text{ calls} \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

120"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how long it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting. It takes 7 minutes.

Now, if Louise has 6 paintings, we need to find out how long it will take for all 6 paintings to dry with the old varnish. We do this by multiplying the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings:
\[ 7 \text{ minutes} \times 6 = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting. It takes 12 minutes.

Again, if Louise has 6 paintings, we need to find out how long it will take for all 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish. We do this by multiplying the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes} \times 6 = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish compared to the old varnish. We do this by subtracting the time it takes with the old varnish from the time it takes with the new varnish:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Crista has 20 plants. Some of them need different amounts of water. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Plants that need half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - So, for 4 plants: \( 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \) cups of water.

2. **Plants that need 1 cup of water:**
   - There are 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 1 cup of water.
   - So, for 8 plants: \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) cups of water.

3. **Plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 20 plants in total.
   - We already counted 4 plants that need half a cup and 8 plants that need 1 cup.
   - So, the rest of the plants are: \( 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \) plants.
   - Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - So, for 8 plants: \( 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \) cups of water.

Now, let's add up all the water needed:
- Water for the half-cup plants: 2 cups
- Water for the 1-cup plants: 8 cups
- Water for the quarter-cup plants: 2 cups

Total water needed: \( 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \) cups

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Phineas Frog needs to get back home after being washed away by a rainstorm. He has to travel 200 yards in total. Half of this distance is on land, and the other half is in water.

1. **Distance on Land**: 
   - Half of 200 yards is 100 yards.
   - Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to hop 100 yards, we divide the distance by the speed:
     \[
     \text{Time on Land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Distance in Water**:
   - The other half of 200 yards is also 100 yards.
   - Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to swim 100 yards, we divide the distance by the speed:
     \[
     \text{Time in Water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time**:
   - To find the total time, we add the time on land and the time in water:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to get back home.

   56 \div 8 = 7
   \]
   Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

2. Each box costs $2.00. To find out how much 7 boxes will cost, we multiply 7 by 2:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the four other phones:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

So, the whole phone plan costs $60.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're doing a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning each week. 

- She has 5 blouses, and each blouse costs $5.00 to clean. So, 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00.
- She has 2 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $8.00 to clean. So, 2 pants * $8.00 = $16.00.
- She has 1 skirt, and it costs $6.00 to clean. So, 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00.

Now, we add all these costs together to find out how much she spends in one week:
- $25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirt) = $47.00.

So, Alicia spends $47.00 each week on dry-cleaning.

Next, we need to find out how much she spends in 5 weeks. We do this by multiplying the weekly cost by 5:
- $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

First, we need to find out how fast John can talk after he trains. He starts at 150 words per minute (WPM), and he gets 2.5 times faster. So, we multiply 150 by 2.5:

150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to figure out how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply 450 by 10:

450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words

Next, we need to find out how long it takes John to say 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his speed:

4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in school!

1. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.
2. On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day. So, 50 + 20 = 70 people.
3. On the third day, there were twice as many people as on the second day. So, 70 x 2 = 140 people.
4. For the rest of the week (4 more days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, 60 x 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up all the people Conor saw over the week:

"Okay, let's count the popcorns step by step!

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times as many pop, so that's \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times as many pop, so that's \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the last 30 seconds, half as many as the previous 30 seconds pop, so that's \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels.
5. After the pan is off the heat, a quarter of the last 30 seconds' popping happens, so that's \(40 \div 4 = 10\) kernels.

First, we need to figure out how many lemons Tim needs for the lemonade for the pool party. The recipe says 1 cup of lemon juice makes 1 gallon of lemonade. Tim wants to make 4 gallons, so he needs 4 cups of lemon juice. 

Now, 6 lemons give us 1 cup of lemon juice. So, for 4 cups, we need:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 24 \text{ lemons} \]

Next, Tim's friend Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade, but it needs to be twice as tart. This means Allen's gallon needs 2 cups of lemon juice. 

For 2 cups of lemon juice, we need:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 12 \text{ lemons} \]

Now, we add the lemons needed for the pool party and the lemons needed for Allen:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to know how much food the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of food a day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- So, 5 kilograms times 3 German Shepherds equals 15 kilograms of food a day for the German Shepherds.

Next, we need to know how much food the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of food a day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, 3 kilograms times 2 Bulldogs equals 6 kilograms of food a day for the Bulldogs.

Now, we add the food for both types of dogs to find out how much food they eat together in a day:
- 15 kilograms (for the German Shepherds) plus 6 kilograms (for the Bulldogs) equals 21 kilograms of food a day for all the dogs.

Finally, we need to find out how much food they eat in a week:
- There are 7 days in a week.

Next, we need to figure out how many legs all the 4-legged animals have. If there are 15 animals and each has 4 legs, we can count them like this:
15 animals × 4 legs each = 60 legs

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we want to know how many pairs of legs there are, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs ÷ 2 = 40 pairs of legs

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40.

"Okay, let's figure out how much the boat is worth after three years. 

1. **First Year:**
   - The boat costs $9000.
   - It loses 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $9000 is \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \).
   - So, after the first year, the boat is worth \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year:**
   - Now the boat is worth $6300.
   - It loses another 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $6300 is \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \).
   - So, after the second year, the boat is worth \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - Now the boat is worth $4410.
   - It loses 20% of its value.
   - 20% of $4410 is \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \).

2. **Bus Cost:**
   - Helen took the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus ride costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - 10% of $80 is $8 (because 10% means 10 out of 100, so 10/100 * 80 = 8).
   - So, the total cost for the bus rides is 7 rides * $8/ride = $56.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus rides together.
   - Total cost = $240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296.

   - Each bowl costs $5.00.
   - For 12 people, she needs 12 bowls.
   - So, the cost for bowls is \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Salad Plates:**
   - Each salad plate costs $4.00.
   - For 12 people, she needs 12 salad plates.
   - So, the cost for salad plates is \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost for dinner plates: $72
- Cost for bowls: $60
- Cost for salad plates: $48

Total cost:
\[ 72 + 60 + 48 = 180 \]

So, Avery will spend $180 on place settings.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Steve took 10 hours to finish the puzzle. Now, we need to find out how long it took Anna.

First, we need to find half of Steve's time. Half of 10 hours is:
\[ 10 \div 2 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Anna took 2 hours more than this half time. So, we add 2 hours to 5 hours:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we need to figure out how much feed one pig eats in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, and they eat twice a day. So, one pig eats:
   - 4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day.

2. Now, we have five pigs. So, all five pigs together eat:
   - 8 pounds/day/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day.

3. Next, we need to find out how much feed all the pigs eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
   - 40 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week.

4. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:
   - 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

So, after a week, Dexter has 20 pounds of feed left.

1. First, we need to know how many hot dogs all the guests will eat. John invited 20 people, and each person will eat 2 hot dogs. So, we do:
   20 people * 2 hot dogs/person = 40 hot dogs.

2. John already has 4 hot dogs from before. So, we need to find out how many more hot dogs he needs to buy:
   40 hot dogs needed - 4 hot dogs he already has = 36 hot dogs.

3. Now, hot dogs come in packs of 6. We need to find out how many packs John needs to buy:
   36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs.

4. Each pack costs $2. So, we need to find out how much 6 packs will cost:
   6 packs * $2 per pack = $12.

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

- She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each. So, 20 cupcakes × $2 = $40.
- She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each. So, 40 cookies × $1 = $40.

Now, let's add the money from the cupcakes and cookies together:
$40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we need to find out how much money Frances spends on the trays.

- She buys 5 trays at $4 each. So, 5 trays × $4 = $20.

Finally, we subtract the cost of the trays from the total money she made:
$80 - $20 = $60.

So, Frances has $60 left.

1. **First Street:**
   - The ice cream truck starts with 5 children following it.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of those 5 children brings another child.
   - So, 5 children each bring 1 more child: \(5 + 5 = 10\).
   - Now there are 10 children following the truck.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children brings 2 more children.
   - So, 10 children each bring 2 more children: \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
   - Adding these 20 new children to the 10 already following: \(10 + 20 = 30\).
   - Now there are 30 children following the truck.

4. **Children Leaving:**
   - The original 5 children who started following the truck on the first street decide to leave.
   - So, 30 children minus the 5 who leave: \(30 - 5 = 25\).

So, the final number of children following the truck is:

"Okay, let's figure out how big the quilt will be!

First, we need to know how much space each size of t-shirt takes up:
- Small t-shirts are 3 square feet each.
- Medium t-shirts are 4 square feet each.
- Large t-shirts are 6 square feet each.

Now, let's count how many of each size Octavia is using:
- She uses 11 small t-shirts.
- She uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- She uses 6 large t-shirts.

Next, we calculate the total area for each size:
- For the small t-shirts: 11 t-shirts * 3 square feet each = 33 square feet.
- For the medium t-shirts: 8 t-shirts * 4 square feet each = 32 square feet.
- For the large t-shirts: 6 t-shirts * 6 square feet each = 36 square feet.

Finally, we add up all the areas to get the total size of the quilt:
- Total area = 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet.

So, the quilt will be 101 square feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many seeds are in a small sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, we can find the total number of seeds in a small sunflower by multiplying 3 by 12:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seeds are in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we can divide 36 by 2:
\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, we add these 18 seeds to the 36 seeds in the small sunflower to get the total number of seeds in the large sunflower:
\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:

- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 × 10 = $20

So, the total cost to make one jar is:
$12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's find out how much it costs to make 10 jars:
$44 × 10 = $440

Next, we need to know how much money Tim makes from selling 10 jars:

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Justin has 750 pennies.
   - 750 pennies × 1 cent = 750 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents:
- 800 cents (from quarters) + 950 cents (from dimes) + 600 cents (from nickels) + 750 cents (from pennies) = 3100 cents

Since 100 cents make 1 dollar, we divide 3100 cents by 100 to get the total in dollars:

Now, when Nate gets back, he starts filling in the holes. He can fill 9 holes each day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, each day, Nate actually fills:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill all 84 holes if he fills 3 holes each day. We do:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to figure out how many weeks 28 days is. We do:

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

But Igor made some mistakes:
- He only got half as many test tubes as asked, so he got \(16 \div 2 = 8\) test tubes.
- He got 2 more Petri dishes than asked, so he got \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
- He got the right number of beakers, which is 7, but he lost some on the way.

In total, Igor put 29 items on the lab bench. We need to find out how many beakers he lost.

Let's add up the items Igor actually put on the bench:
- 8 test tubes
- 16 Petri dishes
- \(7 - x\) beakers (where \(x\) is the number of beakers he lost)

So, the equation is:
\[ 8 + 16 + (7 - x) = 29 \]

Now, let's solve it:

Now, James is putting together 4 tables. So, for 4 tables:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws he uses from the total number of screws he has:

Now, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Aaron runs a mile in 8 minutes (since he ran 2 miles in 16 minutes), Vanessa would take 16 minutes to run one mile because she's half as fast.

So, if Vanessa runs 4 miles and it takes her 16 minutes for each mile, we can calculate the total time she took:

4 miles × 16 minutes per mile = 64 minutes

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

- 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's 2 times $5, which is $10.
- 1 bottle of wine that costs $5.

So, one reservation makes:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money the restaurant makes in one night. The restaurant gets 6 reservations each night, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so we need to find out how much money it makes in a week:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the restaurant makes:
180 dollars in a week."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, we need to find out how much the fruit vendor made in total after selling all the watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on top of the $80 he spent to buy the watermelons.

2. To find the profit, we calculate 25% of $80:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 20
   \]
   So, the profit is $20.

3. Now, we add the profit to the original cost to find the total amount the vendor made:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100
   \]
   So, the vendor made $100 in total from selling all the watermelons.

4. To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total amount by the number of watermelons:
   \[
   \frac{100}{50} = 2
   \]
   So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Dora's Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - So, Dora is 12 - 3 = 9 years old now.

2. **James's Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - So, James is 2 × 9 = 18 years old now.

3. **John's Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is 18 years old now.
   - So, John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.

4. **Youngest Son's Age:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is 37 years old now.
   - So, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

5. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years:**
   - The youngest son is 5 years old now.
   - In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, in 3 years, John's youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

1. **Ana's Peeling Time:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour, there are 60 minutes.
   - So, Ana can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges in one hour.

2. **Jane's Peeling Time:**
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour, there are 60 minutes.
   - So, Jane can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges in one hour.

3. **Difference in Oranges Peeled:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges.
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after one hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the radiator costs $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. That means he only pays 20% of the price. 

To find 20% of $400:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs $80.

Next, the mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. 

To find the total cost for the mechanic:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, Mark paid a total of:

230"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have 70 legs in total. We need to figure out how many of these animals are chickens.

1. **First, let's remember what we know:**
   - Chickens have 2 legs.
   - Cows have 4 legs.
   - There are 20 animals in total.
   - There are 70 legs in total.

2. **Let's use some simple math:**
   - If all 20 animals were chickens, they would have \(20 \times 2 = 40\) legs.
   - But we know there are 70 legs, so there must be some cows too.

3. **Now, let's find out how many extra legs there are:**
   - The extra legs are \(70 - 40 = 30\) legs.
   - Each cow has 2 extra legs compared to a chicken (4 legs - 2 legs = 2 extra legs).

4. **So, how many cows are there?**
   - If each cow has 2 extra legs, and there are 30 extra legs, then the number of cows is \(30 \div 2 = 15\).

5. **Now, let's find out how many chickens there are:**
   - If there are 15 cows, then the number of chickens is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza there are in total. We know that each pizza is cut into 8 slices, and there are 7 pizzas. So, we multiply:

7 pizzas × 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. That means 4 people in total. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

56 slices ÷ 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
