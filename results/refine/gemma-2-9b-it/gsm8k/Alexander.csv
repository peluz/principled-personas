"Let's break down this real estate investment scenario.  

First, we need to calculate the total value of the house after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the house gained $120,000 in value ($80,000 x 1.50 = $120,000).

Adding that increase to the original price, the house is now worth $200,000 ($80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000).

Next, we add the cost of the renovations to find Josh's total investment: $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (renovations) = $130,000.

Finally, subtract the total investment from the final value to determine the profit: $200,000 (final value) - $130,000 (investment) = $70,000.

* With 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed total.
* She's already given out 40 cups (15 + 25).
*  Therefore, she needs 60 - 40 = 20 cups for the last meal.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let 'x' represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This leaves her with x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 left, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18

"Let's break this down:

*  First, we find out how many students chose contemporary dance: 20 students * 20% = 4 students.

*  That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.

*  Next, we see how many of those 16 students chose jazz: 16 students * 25% = 4 students.

*  Finally, the remaining students must have chosen hip-hop: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students.

*  To find the percentage of the whole class who chose hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of students: 12 students / 20 students = 0.6

*  Converting that decimal to a percentage, we get 0.6 * 100% = 60%

Now, solve for 'a':

a = 162 / 18 
a = 9

Now that we know 'a', we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's age = 11a = 11 * 9 = 99

"To figure out the best deal for Vincent, let's compare the cost per flower:

* **Package of 3:** $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.83 per flower
* **Package of 2:** $1.00 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Clearly, buying in packages of 2 is cheaper.  

Now, let's see how many packages of 2 Vincent needs for 18 flowers:

18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages

The total cost would be:

9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

If he bought the packages of 3, it would cost him $15.00.  

Vincent saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by buying the flowers in packages of 2.

"Ah, a classic beehive problem!  To figure out the number of worker bees, we need to understand the relationships within the hive.  

Let's break it down:

* We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
* And there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees.

This means the worker bees make up the largest portion of the hive.  With 700 bees total, we can use a bit of logic to find the number of worker bees. 

Let me think...  If we assume a smaller number of queens, the number of baby bees and worker bees would increase proportionally.  Given the ""twice as many"" relationship, the worker bees must be a significant portion of the total.  

Given the information, the most logical answer is **400**.

"Let's break down this classic poultry problem.  We know the red chickens lay 3 eggs each and the white chickens lay 5.  

Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens and 'w' represent the number of white chickens. We can set up a system of equations:

*  Equation 1 (eggs): 3r + 5w = 42
*  Equation 2 (chickens): w = r + 2

To solve for 'r', we can use substitution.  Substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

"Let's break this problem down.  We know there are 200 students total and they're split into three groups.  If two of the groups have the same number of students, let's call that number 'x'. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than the others, so it has 'x - 10' students.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now we know each of the larger groups has 70 students.  To find the size of the smallest group, we subtract 10:

70 - 10 = 60

"Let's break this down.  We know Farmer Brown has 60 animals total, and twice as many chickens as cows.  

*  If we let 'c' represent the number of cows, we have '2c' chickens.

*  Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60
*  Dividing both sides by 3, we find c = 20 cows.
*  That means there are 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's count the legs:

* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

Finally, the total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Ah, a classic problem of animal husbandry!  To determine the number of dromedaries, we must consider the unique characteristic of each beast. Camels, with their two humps, present a straightforward calculation.  

Let's denote the number of dromedaries as 'd' and the number of camels as 'c'. We know:

* **Total heads:** c + d = 180
* **Total humps:** 2c + d = 304

Solving for 'd', we can rearrange the first equation to get c = 180 - d.  Substituting this into the second equation:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplifying:

360 - 2d + d = 304

-d = -56

Therefore, d = 56.

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down step by step.

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.

*  Lily found 7 more than David.

*  David found half the number of insects Bodhi found.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little algebra.  Let's represent the number of insects each person found with variables:

*  Let 'B' be the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  Let 'D' be the number of insects David found.
*  Let 'L' be the number of insects Lily found.

Now we can set up equations based on the information given:

*  L + D + B = 43  
*  L = D + 7
*  D = B / 2

We can use substitution to solve for L.  Since we know L = D + 7, we can substitute that into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + B = 43

Now, substitute D = B/2 into the equation:

(B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

Simplify and solve for B:

B + 7 + B = 43
2B + 7 = 43
2B = 36
B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find David's total:

D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Finally, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  To figure out his daily savings in the second half, we need to consider the following:

* **Total Days:** April has 30 days.
* **Splitting the Month:**  He's saving twice as much in the second half, so we'll split the month into two 15-day periods.

* **Let's use 'x' to represent the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.**

* **Savings in the First Half:** 15 days * x dollars/day = 15x dollars
* **Savings in the Second Half:** 15 days * (2x dollars/day) = 30x dollars
* **Total Savings:** 15x + 30x = $1125

Now, we can solve for 'x':

* 45x = $1125
* x = $1125 / 45
* x = $25

This means Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half.  

Finally, to find his daily savings in the second half:

* Daily savings in the second half: 30x = 30 * $25 = $750
* **Daily savings in the second half:** $750 / 15 days = $50

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

It seems like we're dealing with a series of operations applied to a number.  To find the final value, we need to work through each step:

1. **Starting Value:** The number train begins with a value of 20.

2. **Half the Number:** We don't know the final number, so let's call it ""x"". Half of ""x"" is x/2.

3. **Sum and Division:** We add the starting value (20) to half the number (x/2) and then divide the result by 5: (20 + x/2) / 5

4. **Multiplication:** Finally, we multiply the result from step 3 by the starting value minus 12 (20 - 12 = 8): [(20 + x/2) / 5] * 8

5. **Simplified Expression:** This simplifies to (160 + 4x) / 5

**Without knowing the value of 'x', we can't get a specific numerical answer. The final value of the number train is represented by the expression (160 + 4x) / 5.**

"Let's figure this out!  Colby has a bunch of coins, and we need to see how many gumballs he can buy.  

* **Quarters:** 8 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $2.00
* **Dimes:** 6 dimes * $0.10/dime = $0.60
* **Nickels:** 14 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $0.70
* **Pennies:** 15 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.15

Adding it all up: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Now, each gumball costs a nickel, which is $0.05.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know there's a twin and a triplet involved, and the twin is 7 years older than one of the triplets.  

Let's say 't' represents the age of one triplet.  The twin would then be 't + 7'.  

The total age of all five children is 44, so we can write the equation:

t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

Simplifying this equation:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know one triplet is 6, we can find the twin's age:

twin's age = t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

"Let's break this down.  We know there are 10 quarts left after the party.  We also know that 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, and 16 students drank 2 quarts each.

First, find the total quarts consumed by the first group: 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, find the total quarts consumed by the second group: 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, add those amounts together to find the total quarts consumed: 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Finally, add the quarts consumed to the quarts remaining to find the original amount: 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, divide the total quarts by 4 to find the original number of gallons: 48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Combining like terms: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying the equation:

4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Finally, substitute the value of J back into the equation P = 2J + 10:

P = (2 * 20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50

"Let's break down Fern's widget-making dilemma.  

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 earns $60 per hour (60 widgets * $6/widget) and the WidgetMaster 9000 earns $270 per hour (45 widgets * $6/widget).

Over a 24-hour day, the Widgeteer 3000 brings in $1440 ($60/hour * 24 hours), and the WidgetMaster 9000 earns $6480 ($270/hour * 24 hours).

Now, let's calculate their monthly earnings, assuming a 30-day month:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** $1440/day * 30 days/month = $43,200/month
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** $6480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400/month

Finally, the difference in their monthly earnings is $194,400 - $43,200 = $151,200.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Comet Halley has an orbital period of 75 years.  This means it takes 75 years for it to complete one full orbit around the sun.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30, and Bill saw it again when he was three times his father's age.  That means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Since the time between sightings is a multiple of the comet's orbital period, we know the difference in Bill's age between the two sightings is also a multiple of 75.  

Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he first saw the comet.

If each adult gets a slice twice as big as a kid's slice, we can think of it this way:

*  Let 'k' represent the size of one kid's slice.
*  Each adult gets 2k.

The total watermelon is divided into 6 slices, so:

4k + 2 * 2k = 6

Simplifying the equation:

4k + 4k = 6
8k = 6
k = 6/8 = 0.75

This means each kid gets a slice of 0.75.  An adult gets 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

To find the percentage, we divide the adult's share by the total and multiply by 100%:

(1.5 / 6) * 100% = 25%

"Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic and needs to account for time spent on rounds and appointments.  

Rounds take 20 minutes per patient, and he has 9 patients, so that's 20 minutes/patient * 9 patients = 180 minutes.

Appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10 appointments, so that's 30 minutes/appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes.

In total, he spends 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes on rounds and appointments.

Converting that to hours, we get 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

Therefore, Doctor Jones has 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left to update his records.

"Let's break this down.  We know the starting population is 50 porcupines, and 3/5 of those are female. That means there are 30 female porcupines.  

Each female gives birth to 4 babies per month, so in a year (12 months) they'd have 4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies each.

With 30 females, that's a total of 30 females * 48 babies/female = 1440 babies born in a year.

Adding those babies to the original population, we have 50 + 1440 = 1490 porcupines.

"Let's break this tennis ball retrieval problem down:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory got in the second set.

*  The first set had 'x + 4' balls.

*  The third set had 'x / 2' balls.

We know the total is 19 balls:  x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combining like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtracting 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15

Dividing both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, the first set had x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

"Ah, a classic depreciation problem!  

Here's how we can figure out the car's value in 2010:

* **Year 2008:**  The car loses 21% of its value, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.
* **Year 2008 Value:**  So, the car is worth $20000 - $4200 = $15800.

* **Year 2009:**  Another 21% depreciation: $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.

* **Year 2009 Value:**  The car is now worth $15800 - $3318 = $12482.

* **Year 2010:**  One more year, another 21% depreciation: $12482 * 0.21 = $2622.62

* **Year 2010 Value:**  Finally, the car's value in 2010 is $12482 - $2622.62 = $9859.38

Think of it like this: 40% is equivalent to 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5.  So, 2/5 of the school is 240 boys.  

To find the whole (100%), we can set up a proportion:

2/5 = 240/x

Cross-multiply: 2 * x = 5 * 240

Simplify: 2x = 1200

Solve for x: x = 1200 / 2 = 600

Now that we know the total school population is 600, we can find the number of girls:

600 - 240 = 360

"Let's break this down.  We know the order is for 400 toys, and they need 20 more to complete it. That means they need to make a total of 420 toys.

Two workers make 6 toys each per hour for a total of 12 toys per hour. Over 10 hours, they produce 12 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.

Another two workers make 4 toys each per hour, for a total of 8 toys per hour. Over 10 hours, they produce 8 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.

So far, that's 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

To reach 420 toys, the fifth worker needs to make 420 toys - 200 toys = 220 toys.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 220 toys / 10 hours = 22 toys per hour.

*  Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted each.
*  Together they painted 2x eggs.
*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs in total, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let Sarah's eggs be represented by 'y'. This means Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.
*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30
*  Simplifying, we get 2y + 12 = 30
*  Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2y = 18
*  Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)
*  Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
*  We also know that 2x + 30 = 56 (total eggs painted)
*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 26
*  Dividing both sides by 2: x = 13 (Arnold painted 13 eggs)
*  Finally, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out how many boxes Nik will need.  He has 200 crayons and wants to put 8 crayons in each box, so he'll need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he's using 25 boxes, so the boxes themselves will weigh 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces (200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon).

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes, we get a total weight of 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.

Finally, we convert ounces to pounds: 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

First, we know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.  We also know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  

Let's use variables to represent the lengths:

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation to represent the total length of all three ropes:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

"Let's break down this soccer match!

In the first half, Team A scored 4 goals, and Team B scored 2 fewer than that, so they scored 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B really stepped up their game, scoring 4 times their first-half total, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.  Team A scored 1/4 the number of goals Team B scored in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up the goals from both halves, Team A scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

We're given two pieces of information:

* **Statement 1:** Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.  This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)
* **Statement 2:** In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   3c + 75 = 5c + 35
   40 = 2c
   c = 20



Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break this down.  Tim's making a classic estimation error here.  He's focusing on the volume of the jar and the jelly bean size, which is a good start, but he's forgetting about packing efficiency.  

Here's how to think about it:

* **Jar Volume:** 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches
* **Jelly Bean Volume:** 0.15 cubic inches each
* **Theoretical Capacity:** 540 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 3600 jelly beans

"Let's break this down.  If Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that represents 3/4 of her total output this year, we can set up a simple equation.

Let 'x' be the total number of novels she wrote this year. We know:

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out the total number of holes dug by the dog: 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Then, we calculate how many net holes Nate fills each day: 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.

Finally, we determine the number of days it takes Nate to fill all the holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill all the holes.

"Let's break this down.  We know Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his pace was 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so she covered 4 miles.  Since Aaron's pace is our baseline, Vanessa's pace is half that, or 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.  

To find Vanessa's total time, we divide her distance by her pace: 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

"This is a classic example of a system of equations problem.  We can solve for the number of chickens using a bit of algebra.

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

Solving for 'c', we can rearrange the first equation to get:

* w = 20 - c

Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
* -2c = -10
* c = 5
