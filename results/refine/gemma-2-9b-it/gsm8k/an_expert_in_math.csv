"Let's break down this real estate investment problem:

* **Initial Investment:** Josh's initial outlay was $80,000 for the house plus $50,000 for repairs, totaling $130,000.

* **Value Appreciation:** The house's value increased by 150%, which is equivalent to a 1.5 multiplier.  Therefore, the increase in value is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.

* **Final Value:**  Adding the appreciation to the original house price, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

* **Profit:**  Subtracting the total investment from the final value gives us the profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

First, we need to determine Julia's rowing rate.  She covers 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Next, we calculate the total distance she rows to reach the shore.  Since the shore is 64 seconds away, she rows a total of 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Finally, we determine the amount of water taken on. The boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed.  Over 80 feet, the boat takes on (2 liters / 10 feet) * 80 feet = 16 liters.

1. **Seth's age is twice Brooke's age:**  This can be represented as  *s = 2b*, where 's' is Seth's age and 'b' is Brooke's age.

2. **In two years, their combined age will be 28:** This translates to the equation *(s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28*.

Now, we can solve for 's' (Seth's age).  

First, simplify the second equation:
*s + b + 4 = 28*
*s + b = 24*

Substitute the first equation (*s = 2b*) into the simplified second equation:
*2b + b = 24*

Combine like terms:
*3b = 24*

Divide both sides by 3 to isolate 'b':
*b = 8*

Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age using the equation *s = 2b*:
*s = 2 * 8*
*s = 16*



**Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the profit per gallon of lemonade.  They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so their revenue per gallon is $0.50 * 20 = $10.  Since each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, their profit per gallon is $10 - $5 = $5.

To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to know how many gallons they made.  They made a total profit of $25, and since each gallon yields a $5 profit, they made 25 / 5 = 5 gallons of lemonade.

Finally, the cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so their total lemon expense is 5 * $3 = $15.

* Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 'm + 2'.

We are given the information that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.  Since Jan is 30, we can set up the following equation:

m - 2 = 5 + (30 / 2)

Simplifying the equation:

m - 2 = 5 + 15
m - 2 = 20
m = 22

Now that we know Mark's current age (m = 22), we can find Jean's age:

Jean's age = m + 2 = 22 + 2 = 24

There are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of a total of six possible outcomes.  Therefore, the probability of this event is 3/6 = 1/2.

* **Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row**

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.  Given that an even number was rolled on the first attempt, the probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Collar Stitches:** The collar requires 1/10 the stitches of the body, so it takes 900 stitches * (1/10) = 90 stitches.

* **Rosette Stitches:** The rosette requires twice the stitches of the collar, meaning it takes 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

* **Total Stitches for Body, Collar, and Rosette:**  The total stitches for these parts is 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

* **Total Stitches for Sleeves:**  Since the entire sweater has 1800 stitches, the sleeves must account for 1800 stitches - 1170 stitches = 630 stitches.

* **Stitches per Sleeve:**  Finally, each sleeve requires 630 stitches / 2 sleeves = 315 stitches.

"To determine the time required to fully charge the phone, we need to consider the charging rate and the current charge level. 

The phone gains 1 percentage point of charge every 3 minutes.  Since it needs to gain 40% more charge (100% - 60% = 40%), it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

Converting minutes to hours, we get 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours.

"Certainly, let's break down this problem.

We know the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width:  Area = length * width.  

We're given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards, which converts to 9 feet).  Let's denote the width as 'w'.  We can set up the equation:

360 = 9 * w

Solving for 'w', we find the width to be 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Substituting our values: Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

First, we need to determine the distance the horse travels.  We know the speed is 32 miles per hour and the time is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.  Using the formula distance = speed * time, we get:

Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we calculate the amount of hay consumed.  The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, so for 16 miles:

Hay consumed = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile = 8 bales

Now, we can determine the total cost of the hay. Each bail costs $3, so:

Total cost = 8 bales * $3/bale = $24

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We're given three variables:

*  *B* = Insects found by Bodhi
*  *D* = Insects found by David
*  *L* = Insects found by Lily

We know:

* *L* + *D* + *B* = 43  (Total insects)
* *L* = *D* + 7       (Lily found 7 more than David)
* *D* = *B* / 2        (David found half of what Bodhi found)

To solve for *L*, we can use substitution.  

First, substitute the second equation into the first:

(*D* + 7) + *D* + *B* = 43

Then, substitute the third equation into the above:

(*B*/2 + 7) + (*B*/2) + *B* = 43

Simplify and solve for *B*:

(3/2)*B* + 7 = 43
(3/2)*B* = 36
*B* = 24

Now that we know *B*, we can find *D*:

*D* = *B*/2 = 24/2 = 12

Finally, substitute *D* back into the equation *L* = *D* + 7:

*L* = 12 + 7 = 19

"To determine the cost per pump in cents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per washing:** Divide the total cost of the shampoo ($24.00) by the number of washings it provides (120): $24.00 / 120 washings = $0.20 per washing.

2. **Calculate the cost per pump:** Since one pump provides 60 washings (half the total), the cost per pump is $0.20 per washing * 60 washings = $12.00.

3. **Convert to cents:** Multiply the cost per pump in dollars by 100: $12.00 * 100 cents/$1 = 1200 cents.

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to analyze the funding pattern.  

The research extends for 50 months, with the first 5 months funded at a constant $100,000.  Subsequently, the funding increases by 50% each month. This represents a geometric progression.

Let's denote:

*  a = the initial funding amount ($100,000)
*  r = the growth factor (1 + 50% = 1.5)
*  n = the number of months after the initial 5 (45 months)

The total cost can be calculated as:

Cost = (a * (1 - r^n)) / (1 - r)  + (a * n)

Plugging in the values:

Cost = (100000 * (1 - 1.5^45)) / (1 - 1.5) + (100000 * 5)

This calculation will give you the total cost of John's research.

"This is a classic example of a system of equations problem.  We can represent the situation with two equations:

*  Let 's' represent the number of sheep.
*  Let 'g' represent the number of geese.

* Equation 1: s + g = 20  (Each animal has one head)
* Equation 2: 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)

To solve for 's', we can use the substitution method:

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'g':  g = 20 - s

2. Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 2: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

3. Simplify and solve for 's': 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

* Smendrick has three times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3P cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3P + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7P + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7P = 329

Dividing both sides by 7: P = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's total:

Becca has 3P + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.



**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We're given a system of equations representing the relationships between the ages of the family members.  

* Let  'b' represent the brother's age.
* Let 's' represent the sister's age.
* Let 'y' represent your age.

We can express the given information as follows:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87

Our goal is to solve for 'y', your age.  We can use substitution to simplify the system of equations.

Substituting the first two equations into the fourth equation, we get:

(b - 3) + b + (b - 3) + (3b - 1) = 87

Combining like terms:

6b - 7 = 87

Adding 7 to both sides:

6b = 94

Dividing both sides by 6:

b = 15.67 (approximately)

Now, substitute the value of 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3:

y = 15.67 - 3

y = 12.67 (approximately)

"Let's analyze Kelly's grocery expenses:

* **Chicken Cost:** Each pack of chicken costs twice the price of a pack of bacon, which is $2. Therefore, each pack of chicken costs 2 * $2 = $4.  The total cost of the chicken is 6 packs * $4/pack = $24.

* **Apple Cost:** Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4.  So, each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. The total cost of the apples is 7 packs * $2/pack = $14.

* **Total Spending:**  Kelly's total spending is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Substituting the second and third equations into the first, we get:

P + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying:

P + 2J + 10 = 100

P = 90 - 2J

Now, substitute the third equation (P = Pa + J) into the simplified equation:

* **Step 1: Calculate the distance covered in the first swim.**

   James swims 60% of 20 miles, which is 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

* **Step 2: Calculate the time spent swimming the first leg.**

   Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

* **Step 3: Calculate the resting time.**

   Resting time is half the swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* **Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance.**

   The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

* **Step 5: Calculate the time spent swimming the remaining distance.**

   James swims at half his usual speed, so his speed is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.  
   Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

* **Step 6: Calculate the total time.**

   Total time = Swimming time (first leg) + Resting time + Swimming time (remaining leg) = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

We're given that the total points scored is 45, and we can represent Azibo's score as 'x'.  Since Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, Bahati's score is 'x + 20'.  Similarly, Dinar scored 10 less than Azibo, so Dinar's score is 'x - 10'.

We can now set up an equation to represent the total points:

x + (x + 20) + (x - 10) = 45

Combining like terms:

3x + 10 = 45

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

3x = 35

x = 35/3 

Therefore, Azibo scored 35/3 points, which is approximately 11.67 points.

"Let's solve this problem using a system of equations.  

Let:

*  A = the number of Pokemon Alex caught
*  S = the number of Pokemon Stan caught
*  W = the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

We are given the following information:

* A + S + W = 339 
* A = S + 5
* S = 4W - 13

Substituting the second and third equations into the first, we get:

(S + 5) + S + (4W - 13) = 339

Simplifying the equation:

2S + 4W - 8 = 339

2S + 4W = 347

Now, solve for W in terms of S using the third equation:

W = (S + 13) / 4

Substitute this value of W into the simplified equation:

2S + 4 * ((S + 13) / 4) = 347

Simplifying further:

2S + S + 13 = 347

3S + 13 = 347

3S = 334

S = 111.33

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We know Comet Halley has an orbital period of 75 years.  This means it reappears every 75 years.

Let 'x' represent Bill's age when he first observed the comet.  His father was 30 years old during his sighting, and Bill saw the comet again when he was three times his father's age at that time.  This translates to 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the time between Bill's two sightings is a multiple of the comet's orbital period, we can express this as:

90 - x = 75

Solving for x, we get:

x = 90 - 75 = 15

"Buford's check-writing frequency can be broken down as follows:

* **Monthly Expenses:** Electric and gas bills amount to 1 + 1 = 2 checks per month.
* **Church Donations:** He contributes 2 checks per month to the church.
* **Quarterly Expense:** The pest and lawn service receives 1 check every three months.

To calculate the annual total, we perform the following:

* **Annual Monthly Checks:** 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks
* **Annual Church Checks:** 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks
* **Annual Quarterly Checks:** 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks

Finally, summing these contributions: 24 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks

**Therefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote's howl duration is twice Tobias's, so it's 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

* **Combined howl of Tobias and Chikote:**  Their combined howl time is 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for the same duration as Tobias and Chikote combined, meaning his howl is also 60 seconds long.

* **Total howl time:**  The total howl time is the sum of their individual howl times: 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

* **Total howl time in minutes:** To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"To determine the percentage of watermelon each adult receives, we can set up a simple proportion. 

Let 'x' represent the size of one child's slice.  Since each adult receives a slice twice the size of a child's slice, an adult's slice is 2x.

The total watermelon is divided into 6 slices: 4 slices for the children (4x) and 2 slices for the adults (2 * 2x).  

This can be represented as: 4x + 4x = 6

Simplifying the equation: 8x = 6

Solving for x: x = 6/8 = 0.75

Therefore, each adult receives 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

To express this as a percentage of the total watermelon, we calculate: (1.5 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 25%

"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we first need to calculate the pool's volume.  The volume of a rectangular prism, like a swimming pool, is found by multiplying its length, width, and depth:

Volume = length × width × depth

Volume = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet 
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Next, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons.  A common conversion factor is 7.48 gallons per cubic foot.

Gallons = Volume (cubic feet) × 7.48 gallons/cubic foot

Gallons = 1400 cubic feet × 7.48 gallons/cubic foot
Gallons = 10472 gallons

Finally, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost:

Total Cost = Gallons × Cost per gallon

Let 'x' represent the initial charge of the power bank.

*  After the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, resulting in a loss of 0.09 * 5 = 0.45x.  The remaining charge is then x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

*  Over the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour, leading to a loss of 0.07 * 3 = 0.21x.

*  The final charge is 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x. We know this final charge is 28% of the original capacity, so 0.34x = 0.28.

"To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his expenses, we need to consider two factors: the total loan amount and the lost income from forgoing his job during his studies.

First, calculate the total loan amount: $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

Next, calculate the lost income: $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

The total amount Jim needs to earn back is the sum of these two figures: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

Finally, divide the total amount by his new income to find the number of years required: $300,000 / ($25,000/year * 3) = 4 years.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We're given that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls across three sets.  

Let's represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'.  We can then express the number of balls retrieved in each set as follows:

* First set: x + 4
* Second set: x
* Third set: x / 2

The sum of balls retrieved in all three sets equals 19, so we can set up the equation:

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

We know the Allosaurus consumed the final 270 kilograms of meat, which represents half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged.  

Let 'x' be the original weight of the triceratops.  

* The T-Rex consumed half, leaving x/2.
* The velociraptors then consumed half of that remaining amount, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4.
* This means the 270 kg consumed by the Allosaurus is equal to x/2 - x/4.

We can now set up an equation:

x/2 - x/4 = 270

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator:

(2x/4) - (x/4) = 270

Combining like terms:

x/4 = 270

Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:

x = 1080



Therefore, the original triceratops weighed **1080 kilograms**.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area to be painted.  

The area of each of the north and south walls is 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.

The area of each of the east and west walls is 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is (80 square feet * 2) + (40 square feet * 2) = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, Tony will need 240 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

At a cost of $12 per gallon, the total cost to paint the room will be 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.

*  Let Mike's age be represented by 'm', Martha's age by 'm', and Jeff's age by 'j'.

* We know m = 24 (Mike's age).
* We also know that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so  m - 4 = j.
*  Finally, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so j + 10 = m.

Now we can substitute the known values to solve for Jeff's age (j):

*  24 - 4 = j 
*  20 = j
*  j + 10 = 24  

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"Let  'm' represent the number of men and 'w' represent the number of women on the bus. We know:

*  m/w = 5/9 
* m + w = 84

We can solve for 'w' (the number of women) using these equations.  

First, solve for 'm' in terms of 'w' from the first equation:
m = (5/9)w

Substitute this value of 'm' into the second equation:
(5/9)w + w = 84

Combine the 'w' terms:
(14/9)w = 84

Multiply both sides by (9/14) to isolate 'w':
w = 54

After 20 women alight, the number of women remaining is:
54 - 20 = 34

   * Let 'x' be the number of seashells Carrey collected.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**

   * Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey: Carlos = 2x
   * Jim collected 5 more than Carlos: Jim = 2x + 5

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells:**

   * Total seashells = Carrey + Carlos + Jim 
   * Total seashells = x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5

4. **Divide the total seashells equally:**

   * Seashells per person = (5x + 5) / 3

5. **We know Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can substitute:**

   * 2x + 5 = 27

6. **Solve for x:**

   * 2x = 22
   * x = 11  (This is the number of seashells Carrey collected)

7. **Substitute the value of x back into the equation for seashells per person:**

   * Seashells per person = (5 * 11 + 5) / 3 
   * Seashells per person = (55 + 5) / 3
   * Seashells per person = 60 / 3
   * Seashells per person = 20

    *  P(B|P) = 1/3 (probability of wearing a bow given they are wearing purple)
    *  P(B|¬P) = 1 (probability of wearing a bow given they are not wearing purple)

* **Calculate the Conditional Probability:**

We want to find P(P|B), the probability a baby is wearing purple given they are wearing a bow.  We can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(P|B) = [P(B|P) * P(P)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of wearing a bow, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|P) * P(P)  +  P(B|¬P) * P(¬P)
P(B) = (1/3) * (3/4) + 1 * (1/4) 
P(B) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2

Now, plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(P|B) = [(1/3) * (3/4)] / (1/2)
P(P|B) = 1/2 * 2
P(P|B) = 1

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We're given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  We can represent this information with variables:

* Let  'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (y = 12), we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry ice cubes as 's'.  The problem states that Mary makes 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4 for blueberry cubes.  We can express this mathematically as 5s - 4.

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116.  Adding 4 to both sides, we have 6s = 120.  

Finally, dividing both sides by 6, we find s = 20.

Now, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes: 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To determine the time it takes Nate to fill all the holes, we need to consider the net progress made each day.  

The dog digs 6 holes per day, and Nate fills 9 holes per day, resulting in a net gain of 3 holes filled daily (9 - 6 = 3).

Therefore, it will take Nate 28 days to fill all 84 holes (84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days).

Finally, converting days to weeks, we find it takes Nate 4 weeks (28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks).

"To determine the difference in enrollment, we simply subtract Butler High School's enrollment from Norman High School's enrollment. 

Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, and Butler High School enrolls (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students.

Therefore, the difference in enrollment is 4000 - 3000 = 1000 students.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
    * Let 'b' represent the number of beakers Igor initially had.
    * Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * t = 16 / 2  (Igor gathered half the requested test tubes)
    * p = 14 + 2 (Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested)
    * t + b + p = 29 (The total number of items on the bench)

* **Substitute the values of 't' and 'p' into the third equation:**
    * (16 / 2) + b + (14 + 2) = 29

* **Simplify and solve for 'b':**
    * 8 + b + 16 = 29
    * b + 24 = 29
    * b = 29 - 24
    * b = 5

* **Therefore, Igor initially had 5 beakers.**  Since he lost some on the way to the lab bench, we can determine the number lost by subtracting the number on the bench from the initial number: 5 - 2 = 3.



**Answer:** Igor lost 3 beakers.

"Certainly, let's break down this problem:

James requires 16 screws for the legs of his tables (4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs).  Since each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws needed is 32 (16 legs * 2 screws/leg).

Therefore, he will have 8 screws left over (40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws).

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let  *v* represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute and *a* represent Aaron's speed in miles per minute.

We know:

* Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron:  Vanessa's distance = 4 miles, Aaron's distance = 2 miles
* Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa: *a* = 2*v*
* Aaron's time is 16 minutes:  Time = Distance / Speed, so 16 = 2 / *a*

Now we can solve for *a*:

16 = 2 / *a*
*a* = 2 / 16
*a* = 0.125 miles per minute

Since *a* = 2*v*, we can find Vanessa's speed:

0.125 = 2*v*
*v* = 0.125 / 2
*v* = 0.0625 miles per minute

Finally, calculate Vanessa's time:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute
Time = 64 minutes



**Answer:** 64 minutes

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we first need to calculate the total revenue.  

The vendor made a 25% profit on the $80 investment, which translates to a profit of $20 (0.25 * $80 = $20).  

Therefore, the total revenue from selling the watermelons is $100 ($80 + $20).

Finally, dividing the total revenue by the number of watermelons gives us the selling price per watermelon: $100 / 50 = $2.

"This is a classic example of a system of equations problem.  We can represent the situation with the following:

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

To solve for 'c', we can use elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution:

1. Solve the first equation for 'w': 
   w = 20 - c

2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. Simplify and solve for 'c':
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5



Therefore, there are **5** chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
