"Okay, let's break down this house flipping scenario. 

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value went up by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal.  

Here's how I figured that out:

* Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
* With 20 chickens, that's 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups of feed total.
* She's already given out 40 cups (15 cups + 25 cups).
* So, she needs 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups for the last meal.

"Let's break this down!  Kylar's buying glasses in a pattern:

*  The first glass is $5.
*  Every other glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.

Since he wants 16 glasses, he'll have 8 pairs of these alternating prices.  Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

"Let's break this down:

*  Carla downloads 2 GB per minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

*  The restart happens at 40% of the download, which is 100 minutes * 0.40 = 40 minutes.

*  At that point, she's downloaded 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

*  She has to redownload the remaining 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.

*  This takes another 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

*  Adding the initial download time, the restart time, and the redownload time, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **First leg:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    * He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    * He then drives 30 miles per hour for half an hour (0.5 hours), covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    * He has 4 hours for the return trip, but has already used 2.5 hours, leaving 1.5 hours.
    * In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.
    * The total distance covered on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

* **Final distance:**  John is 180 miles away from home after the first leg and travels 135 miles back.  Therefore, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18



**Answer:** Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

If the book is selling for $19.50 after a 25% discount, that means the $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).

To find the original price, we can set up a proportion:

75/100 = $19.50 / x

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

If their total age is 162, we can think of it like this:

* Darrell's age is represented by 7 parts.
* Allen's age is represented by 11 parts.

Together, these parts make up 18 total parts (7 + 11 = 18).

To find the value of one part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts: 162 / 18 = 9.

"Let's break this down!  

Since each level is half the size of the one below it, we're dealing with a geometric sequence.  We know the top level is 16 square feet.  To find the total square footage, we need to add up the area of all four levels:

* Level 1: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 3: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet
* Level 4: 128 * 2 = 256 square feet

"To figure out the best deal for Vincent, let's compare the cost per flower:

* **Package of 3:** $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.83 per flower
* **Package of 2:** $1.00 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since the packages of 2 are cheaper per flower, that's the way to go!

Vincent needs 18 flowers, so he'd buy 18 / 2 = 9 packages of 2.

That means he'd spend 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

If he bought the packages of 3, he'd spend $15.00.

So, Vincent saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00  by buying the packages of 2.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It sounds like we have a classic beehive population problem.  Here's how to break it down:

* **Queens:**  We know there are twice as many babies as queens, and twice as many workers as babies.  
* **Babies:**  Let's say there are 'q' queens. That means there are 2q baby bees.
* **Workers:**  With twice as many workers as babies, we have 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

* **Total:**  All together, we have q + 2q + 4q = 700 bees.

* **Simplify:**  That means 7q = 700

* **Solve for q:**  Divide both sides by 7, and we find q = 100 queens.

* **Find the workers:** Since we have 4q workers, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

"Let's break this down.  We're dealing with exponential growth here since the price increases by a percentage of the *current* price each time.

The price starts at $20 and increases by 20% every two months.  This means the price is multiplied by 1.20 every two months.

To find the price after 36 months, we can use the following formula:

*Final Price = Initial Price * (Growth Factor)^(Number of Periods)*

In this case:

* Initial Price = $20
* Growth Factor = 1.20
* Number of Periods = 36 months / 2 months/period = 18 periods

Plugging these values into the formula:

"Let's break this down!

There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a standard six-sided die (4, 5, and 6).  That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number greater than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider each roll separately. There are 3 even numbers on the die (2, 4, and 6), so the chance of rolling one even number is 3 out of 6, or 1/2.  Since each roll is independent, we multiply those probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Converting that to a percentage, we get (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

"Let's figure this out!  We know Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, and red chickens lay 3 eggs each while white chickens lay 5.  

Let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens. We can set up two equations:

*  3r + 5w = 42  (Equation 1: Total eggs)
*  w = r + 2   (Equation 2: White chickens are 2 more than red)

Now, we can substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then another 40% longer to reach 400 degrees.  That extra time is 20 minutes * 0.40 = 8 minutes.  So, heating the oil takes a total of 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

Since cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, the chicken cooks in 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

*  With a 10% tax rate on his net income after property taxes, his income tax is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.
*  His net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

"Let's figure this out!  

* If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this: for every 1 cow, there are 2 chickens. 
*  Since there are 60 animals total, we need to find a way to split that 60 evenly between cows and chickens that follows that 1:2 ratio.

*  Let's say there are 'x' cows. That means there would be '2x' chickens.
*  Together, they make up 60 animals: x + 2x = 60
*  Combining like terms, we get 3x = 60
*  Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 20 cows.
*  So, there are 20 cows and 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

*  Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs.
*  That means the cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs, and the chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
*  Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

* He spends half his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each and he buys 40 of them.

First, figure out how much he spent on gumballs: 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since he spent half his change on gumballs, he had $2.00 * 2 = $4.00 in change before buying gumballs.

This means he spent $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00 on candy.

Finally, divide the amount spent on candy by the price per pound to find out how many pounds he bought: $6.00 / $1.50/pound = 4 pounds.

*  Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour he needs than bottles of milk, we subtract: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 more bags.

"Mel's air conditioner uses 900 watts of power for 8 hours a day, which means it consumes 900 * 8 = 7200 watt-hours per day.  

If he reduces the usage to 3 hours, it will use 900 * 3 = 2700 watt-hours per day.  

This saves him 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watt-hours each day.

Over 30 days, the total energy saved is 4500 * 30 = 135,000 watt-hours.

Converting to kilowatt-hours, we get 135,000 / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

"Let's break down Carolyn's company's payroll.

First, we need to figure out how much each employee earned in a month.  They work 40 hours a week at $15 an hour, so that's $15 * 40 = $600 per week.

Over a month with four weeks, that's $600 * 4 = $2400 per employee.

In May, they had 40 employees, so the total payroll was $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees left, which is 40 / 4 = 10 employees.

That means they had 40 - 10 = 30 employees left.

So, June's payroll was $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

The total payroll for both months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Let's break this down.  We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations:

*  Equation 1: c + d = 180  (Total heads)
*  Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (Total bumps)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'c':  c = 180 - d

2. Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Becky:** 20 apples * $0.45/apple = $9.00  
   Then, she gets a $1.00 discount, so she pays $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00

* **Kelly:** 20 apples * $0.50/apple = $10.00
   She gets a 10% discount, which is $10.00 * 0.10 = $1.00 off.  So she pays $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00

Finally, Kelly paid $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00 more than Becky.

"That's a great question!  As a marine biologist, I can tell you that remoras are fascinating creatures.  

To figure out the percentage, we need to do a little calculation. First, let's convert everything to inches:

* The shark is 10 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so it's 10 * 12 = 120 inches long.
* Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are two of them, so their total length is 6 * 2 = 12 inches.

Now we can find the percentage:

(Remora length / Shark length) * 100% = (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100% = 10%

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down!

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily was a bit of a bug enthusiast and found 7 more than David.
*  David, on the other hand, found half the number of insects Bodhi did.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's say:

*  B = the number of insects Bodhi found
*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We can write these equations based on the information given:

* L + D + B = 43 
* L = D + 7
* D = B / 2

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplifying:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Dividing both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16



**Answer:** Lily found 16 insects.

"Let's break this down!  

If the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can represent this with an equation:

Combining like terms:

* 4 * Lot cost = $120,000

To find the cost of the lot, divide both sides by 4:

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since he wants to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month compared to the first half, we can set up an equation to represent this.

Let 'x' be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.  

* Savings in the first half: 15x 
* Savings in the second half: 30 * (2x) = 60x
* Total savings: 15x + 60x = $1125

Combining like terms:

75x = $1125

Now, solve for x:

x = $1125 / 75 
x = $15

So, Elvis saves $15 each day in the first half of April.  

To find his daily savings in the second half, we multiply that by 2:

$15 * 2 = $30

"Let's break this problem down.  

If Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can represent this mathematically. Let 'b' be the amount Brad receives.  Jeff would then get 4b.

Since their total amount is $100, we have the equation:

b + 4b = 100

Combining like terms:

5b = 100

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides by 5:

b = 20

Now, to find Jeff's share, we multiply Brad's amount by 4:

Jeff's share = 4 * 20 = 80

*  He increases it by 50%, which is the same as multiplying by 1.50 (100% + 50% = 150%,  150/100 = 1.50).
*  So, the new weight is 8 * 1.50 = 12 pounds.
*  He then decides to use a weight that's 2 pounds lighter.
*  Therefore, his final weight is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

"That's a straightforward calculation!  Here's how to figure that out:

First, we need to find out how many rotations the tires make in a year.  Since the car makes 725 rotations every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that means the tires rotate 400 miles * (725 rotations / 2 miles) = 145,000 rotations per month.

Over a year, that's 145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations per year.

Finally, we can divide the tire's total lifespan by the yearly rotations to find out how many years the tire will last: 10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.

"Bubbles needs to figure out how many goats will make up 30% of her total stuffed animals.  

First, let's find the total number of stuffed animals she has: 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 stuffed animals.

To find out how many goats she needs, we can multiply the total number of animals by 30%: 14 * 0.30 = 4.2

"Let's calculate the total number of petals in the vase.

*  Rose starts with 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
*  Then she adds 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals

First, figure out how long each friend plays:

* Jack: 20 minutes per quarter
* Weaker friends: 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter
* Better friend: 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's see how many quarters each friend uses:

* Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* Weaker friends: 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters
* Better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters

Finally, add up the quarters used by everyone: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

"Let's break down this recipe!  

*  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, so let's call that amount 'z'.
*  She uses the same amount of salt and sugar, so let's call that amount 's'.
*  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so oil is 2s ounces.

We know the total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces: z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Simplifying the equation: 2z + 4s = 10

Since we know z = s (same amount of zest and salt), we can substitute: 2s + 4s = 10

Combining like terms: 6s = 10

Solving for s: s = 10/6 = 5/3 ounces

Now, we can find the amount of oil: 2s = 2 * (5/3) = 10/3 ounces.

While it seems like we need to calculate the turtles' speed, the key is realizing that the highway's length is constant.  Since the kangaroos and turtles are traveling at different speeds, they'll take different amounts of time to cover the same distance. 

Let's think about it this way:

* If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, that means the highway is long enough for them to travel for 18 hours at their combined speed.
*  Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, they'll take twice as long to cover the same distance.

Therefore, four turtles would take 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours.

*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Simplifying: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

"Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left. 

First, the chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.

Then, the total cost of the chicken is 6 packs * $4/pack = $24.

The strawberries cost $4 each, so 3 packs cost 3 * $4 = $12.

And the apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.  

That means 7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.

Adding up all the costs, we get $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, subtracting her spending from her budget, Kelly has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

*  Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
*  Let Paul's age be represented by 'Pa'
*  Let John's age be represented by 'J'

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  (The total age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100)
* Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages)

Now, we can use substitution to find Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the third equation:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. Substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50

"Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay to figure out his savings.

He's staying for 17 hours total (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day).  The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each additional hour.

*  Extra hours: 17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours
*  Cost of extra hours: 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos
*  Total cost with extra hours: 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If he'd paid for the full 24 hours, it would have cost him 1600 pesos.

*  Savings: 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

"Let's figure out how much hay Nate needs. 

Each goat eats 5 pounds of hay, and each sheep eats 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat eats.  Twice the amount a goat eats is 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds.  So, each sheep eats 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay.

Nate has 15 goats who each eat 5 pounds, so that's 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

He also has 12 sheep who each eat 7 pounds, so that's 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.

In total, Nate needs 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds of hay.

"Let's break this swimming problem down step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Distance Swum** 
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, so he covers 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

* **Step 2: Time for First Swim**
   At 2 miles per hour, it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

* **Step 3: Rest Time**
   He rests for half the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* **Step 4: Remaining Distance**
   He has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to swim.

* **Step 5: Time for Second Swim**
   He swims the remaining distance at half his usual speed (1 mile per hour) so it takes 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

* **Step 6: Total Time**

*  Let 'k' represent the size of one kid's slice.
*  Each adult gets 2k.

Since the watermelon is divided into 6 equal slices, we have:

4k + 2 * 2k = 6

Simplifying the equation:

4k + 4k = 6
8k = 6
k = 6/8 = 0.75

So, each adult gets 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

To find the percentage, we divide the adult's share by the total slices and multiply by 100%:

(1.5 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 25%




**Answer:** 25%

"Let's break this down:

* Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic.
* Rounds take 20 minutes per patient, and he has 9 patients, so that's 20 minutes/patient * 9 patients = 180 minutes for rounds.
* Appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10 appointments, so that's 30 minutes/appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes for appointments.
*  In total, he spends 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes on rounds and appointments.
*  Converting 480 minutes to hours, we get 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.
*  Finally, subtracting the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total workday, he has 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left for updating his records.

"Let's break this down!  

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. Since 3/5 of the population are female, there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 female porcupines.

"Let's figure out how much it will cost to fill the Smith's pool!

First, we need to find the pool's volume.  We can do that by multiplying the width, length, and depth:

Volume = 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company says they need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

Gallons = 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 8260 gallons

* **Day 2:** Wanda pumped 2/3 of her Day 1 amount, meaning she pumped (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her Day 1 amount, so she pumped (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.

* **Total Pumped:**  Over the two days, they pumped a total of 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let 'x' represent the initial charge of the power bank.

*  The power bank lost 45% of its charge in the first 5 hours (9% per hour * 5 hours).

*  This leaves 0.55x of the charge remaining (100% - 45% = 55%).

*  Over the next 3 hours, it lost another 21% (7% per hour * 3 hours).

*  The final charge is 28%, so we can set up the equation: 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.28

*  Combining like terms: 0.34x = 0.28

*  Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.34

"Here's how to solve this problem:

First, find the sale price: 75% of $2000 is (0.75) * $2000 = $1500.

Let 'x' be the amount of fence Sam gets.  Harry would then get 'x + 60'.  

Since the total fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation:

Combining like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted each.  
*  Together they painted 2x eggs.
*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs in total, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let Sarah's eggs be represented by 'y'. This means Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.
*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30
*  Combining like terms: 2y + 12 = 30
*  Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2y = 18
*  Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)
*  Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
*  Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and together they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs, each of them painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.
*  Finally, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

* **Statement 1:**  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""  This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

* **Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""  This gives us: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

"Let's break this down.  John's scotch purchase is straightforward: 10 bottles at $60 each totals $600.  

The cognac is a bit trickier. Since each bottle costs 50% more than the scotch, we need to calculate that first: $60 * 0.50 = $30 more per bottle.  That means each cognac bottle costs $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, he buys twice as many cognac bottles as scotch, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  

Finally, the total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.

"Let's break down this popcorn problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1:**  The first 30 seconds yield 20 popped kernels.
* **Step 2:**  The next 30 seconds see three times that amount, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.
* **Step 3:**  The popping rate quadruples in the following 30 seconds, resulting in 20 * 4 = 80 kernels.
* **Step 4:**  The final 30 seconds see a halving of the popping rate from the previous 30 seconds, meaning 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.
* **Step 5:**  Finally, a quarter of the kernels from the last 30 seconds pop from residual heat: 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Adding up all the popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.
