"Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal.  

Here's how I figured that out:

* Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
* With 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed total.
* She's already given out 40 cups (15 + 25).
*  So, she needs 60 - 40 = 20 cups more.

"Well, that depends on a few factors.  A lemon tree typically takes about 3 years to start producing fruit.  So,  it'll take a while for Carlos to see a return on his investment.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what remained, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 left over, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.  This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

Let's represent their ages with variables:

* Darrell's age = 7a
* Allen's age = 11a

We also know their total age is 162:

7a + 11a = 162

Combining like terms:

18a = 162

Now, solve for 'a':

a = 162 / 18 
a = 9

Now that we know 'a', we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's age = 11a = 11 * 9 = 99

Finally, to find Allen's age in 10 years, simply add 10:

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109

If Gretchen has 110 coins total and 30 more gold coins than silver, we can think of it this way:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Running Speed:** Since skipping is half her running speed, and she skips at 3 mph, her running speed is 3 mph * 2 = 6 mph.
* **Walking Speed:**  She runs four times faster than she walks, so her walking speed is 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.
* **Distance Covered Running:** She runs for one-third of the time, which is 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours.  Over those 2 hours, she covers 2 hours * 6 mph = 12 miles.
* **Distance Covered Walking:** She walks for two-thirds of the time, which is 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.  Over those 4 hours, she covers 4 hours * 1.5 mph = 6 miles.

"Alright, let's break this down.  If a team won 8 more games than they lost, and they played a total of 22 games, we can set up an equation.

Let 'L' represent the number of losses.  Wins would then be 'L + 8'.  

The total games played is the sum of wins and losses: L + (L + 8) = 22

Simplifying the equation: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Dividing both sides by 2: L = 7

So they lost 7 games.  To find the wins, we add 8: 7 + 8 = 15

Multiplying that by 100% gives us 20%.

"Alright, let's break down this beehive problem.  

We know there are 700 bees total, and the ratio of worker bees to baby bees to queen bees is 2:2:1.  

To find the number of worker bees, we can use a little bit of proportion.  Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens, we can think of it this way:

* **Queens:** 1 part
* **Baby Bees:** 2 parts
* **Worker Bees:** 4 parts

This means each ""part"" represents 700 bees / 7 parts = 100 bees.

Therefore, there are 4 parts * 100 bees/part = 400 worker bees.

"This is a classic example of a system of equations problem.  We can solve for the number of red chickens (r) using the following steps:

* **Define variables:**
    *  r = number of red chickens
    *  w = number of white chickens

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  Equation 1 (eggs): 3r + 5w = 42 
    *  Equation 2 (chickens): w = r + 2

* **Substitute** the value of 'w' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
    * 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

* **Simplify and solve for 'r':**
    * 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
    * 8r + 10 = 42
    * 8r = 32
    * r = 4

"To figure this out, we need to find the total distance Gary walks, which is the perimeter of the park.  

Perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

So, the perimeter is 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles.

Finally, we can calculate the time it takes Gary to walk the perimeter:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let 's' represent the current amount of water in the small pool.

* Since the big pool has four times the water of the small pool now, the big pool has 4s gallons.

*  Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool.  Let's say the small pool had 's + 16' gallons four minutes ago (because it lost 16 gallons). This means the big pool had 2(s + 16) gallons four minutes ago.

*  Both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, so the change in water level is the same for both.

*  We can set up an equation: 4s = 2(s + 16) - 16

*  Simplifying the equation: 4s = 2s + 32 - 16
*  Combining like terms: 4s = 2s + 16
*  Subtracting 2s from both sides: 2s = 16
*  Dividing both sides by 2: s = 8



**Answer:** The small pool has 8 gallons now.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let Ruby's current age be represented by 'R'
*  Let Sam's current age be represented by 'S'

We're given two key pieces of information:

1. **Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:** This translates to the equation R = 6S
2. **In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:** This translates to the equation R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now we can use these equations to solve for Sam's current age (S).

Substitute the first equation (R = 6S) into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Simplify and solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6



**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Let's break this problem down.  We know there are 200 students total and they're split into three groups.  Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the smallest group has 10 fewer students than those.

Let's use algebra to represent this:

* Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the larger groups.
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

Now we can set up an equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

So, each of the larger groups has 70 students.  

The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Well, this is a classic problem!  Let's break it down.  

* **Step 1: Figure out the number of each animal.**

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can set up a simple equation:

* Let 'c' represent the number of cows.
* Chickens: 2c

* Total animals: c + 2c = 60
* Combine like terms: 3c = 60
* Solve for 'c': c = 20 cows

* Chickens: 2 * 20 = 40 chickens

* **Step 2: Calculate the total number of legs.**

* Cows have 4 legs each: 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* Chickens have 2 legs each: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs
* Total legs: 80 legs + 80 legs = 160 legs

In May, they had 40 employees, so the total payroll was $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees left, which is 40 / 4 = 10 employees.  That leaves them with 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

So, June's payroll was $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

The total payroll for both months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Joanne's Shortest Trees:** Joanne picked half as many apples from the shortest trees as the tallest, so she got 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

* **Sister's Tallest Trees:**  The sister picked twice as many from the tallest trees as Joanne, meaning she got 30 * 2 = 60 apples.

* **Sister's Shortest Trees:** The sister picked three times as many from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she got 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

* **Sister's Total:**  The sister picked a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Joanne's Total (Excluding Average):** Joanne picked 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

* **Joanne's Average Apples:** Since the sisters gathered 500 apples total, Joanne must have picked 500 - 105 = 395 apples.  Subtracting her apples from the tallest and shortest trees, she picked 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Well, this is a classic problem!  You've got your heads and your humps, which means we're dealing with a bit of a system of equations.  

Let's say 'c' is the number of camels and 'd' is the number of dromedaries.  We know:

*  c + d = 180  (total heads)
*  2c + d = 304 (total humps)

To solve for 'd', we can use a little algebraic trickery.  Subtract the first equation from the second:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180

This simplifies to:

c = 124

Now, plug that value of 'c' back into either of the original equations to find 'd'.  Let's use the first one:

124 + d = 180

Subtract 124 from both sides:

d = 56



**Answer:** 56 dromedaries

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and we know he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, that means he saved $2 on the jogger jeans.

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we add that $2 back in: $22 + $2 = $24.

Finally, to see how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, we subtract the price of the tattered jeans: $24 - $28 = -$4.

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**

   *  B = insects Bodhi found
   *  D = insects David found
   *  L = insects Lily found

* **Set up equations based on the information given:**

   *  L + D + B = 43  (Total insects)
   *  L = D + 7       (Lily found 7 more than David)
   *  D = B / 2        (David found half of what Bodhi found)

* **Solve for the variables:**

   1.  Substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:
       (D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

   2. Simplify the equation:
       4D + 7 = 43

   3. Subtract 7 from both sides:
       4D = 36

   4. Divide both sides by 4:
       D = 9

   5. Substitute the value of D back into the equation L = D + 7:

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  To figure out his daily savings in the second half, we need to consider the following:

* **Total Days:** April has 30 days.
* **Double Savings:** He aims to save twice as much each day in the second half compared to the first.

Let 'x' represent the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.  

* **First Half Savings:** 15x

Solving for x:

x = $1125 / 45
x = $25

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

It seems like we're dealing with a series of operations applied to a number.  To find the final value, we need to work through each step:

1. **Starting Value:** The number train begins with a value of 20.

2. **Half the Number:** We don't know the final number, so let's call it ""x"". Half of ""x"" is x/2.

3. **Sum and Division:**  We add the starting value (20) to half the number (x/2) and then divide the result by 5: (20 + x/2) / 5

4. **Multiplication:** Finally, we multiply the result from step 3 by the starting value minus 12 (20 - 12 = 8): [(20 + x/2) / 5] * 8

5. **Simplified Expression:** This simplifies to (160 + 4x) / 5

**Without knowing the value of 'x', we can't get a specific numerical answer. The final value of the number train is represented by the expression (160 + 4x) / 5.**

"Let's break this jelly bean problem down.  We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500 and we have these relationships:

* Red jelly beans are 1% less than blue jelly beans.
* Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue jelly beans.

Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.  We can set up the following equations:

* Red: 0.99b
* Green: 1.01b

Now, we can express the total number of jelly beans as:

0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b':

b = 4500 / 2.99 
b ≈ 1505

Now we can find the number of green jelly beans:

Green: 1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

And the number of red jelly beans:

Red: 0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490

Finally, the difference between green and red jelly beans is:

"Let's break this problem down.  We know there's a twin and a triplet involved, and the twin is 7 years older than one of the triplets.  

Let's say 't' is the age of one triplet.  That means the twin is 't + 7' years old.

Their combined ages are 44, so we can write the equation:

t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

Simplifying:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know one triplet is 6, we can find the twin's age:

twin age = t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

* **Total Bill:** $40 (vaccines) + 0.60x (heartworm check) = x (total bill)

* **Solving for x:**
    * Subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40
    * Subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40
    * Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x

"Let's break down this recipe problem.  

*  We know Tanya uses equal amounts of citrus zest and fragrance, and equal amounts of salt and sugar.  
*  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's represent the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as 'x'.  Since salt and sugar are equal, they are also 'x'.  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so oil is 2x.

The total amount in the jar is 10 ounces: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms: 5x = 10

Dividing both sides by 5: x = 2

Oil is 2x, so oil is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

"Let's break down this card-counting problem:

*  Let 'P' represent the number of cards PJ has.
*  Smendrick has three times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3P cards.
*  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3P + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7P + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7P = 329

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let your brother's age be 'b'

*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Combining like terms: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

To find out when she'll be three times her current age, we need to figure out when she'll be 24 (8 * 3 = 24).

Since she's currently 8, it will take her 16 more years to reach 24 (24 - 8 = 16).

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Let Peter's age be represented by 'P', Paul's age by 'Pa', and John's age by 'J'.

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100 
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute both the second and modified third equations into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying the equation:

4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Finally, substitute the value of J back into the equation P = 2J + 10:

P = (2 * 20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50

"Alright, let's crack this Pokemon case!  

We've got Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe with a combined total of 339 Pokemon.  Alex is 5 ahead of Stan, and Stan is 13 less than four times what Adelwolfe caught.  

To find Stan's catch, let's use some algebra:

* Let 'S' represent Stan's Pokemon.
*  Adelwolfe's catch is (S + 13) / 4 
* Alex caught S + 5

Now, plug those into the total catch equation:

S + S + (S + 13) / 4  = 339

Simplify and solve for S:

* 2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 339
* 8S + S + 13 = 1356
* 9S = 1343
* S = 149.22

Since we can't have fractions of Pokemon, we'll round down.  

**Stan caught 149 Pokemon.**

"Let's figure this out!  To make sure Pat has enough room for all her flowers, we need to figure out how many plants she can fit in her flower bed.  

First, we need to know how many inches long her flower bed is.  111 feet times 12 inches per foot equals 1332 inches.  

Now, we need to account for the space between each plant.  Pat needs 1.5 feet between each plant, which is 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.

So, the total space for the plants is 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, Pat can fit 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants.  Since Pat can't have half a plant, she'll need to buy 110 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**

* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**

* **Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the earnings from small stuffed animals are 2x * $4 = $8x.**

* **Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, or $4 * 3 = $12.**

* **The earnings from large stuffed animals are x * $12 = $12x.**

* **Teresa's total earnings are $8x + $12x = $120.**

* **Combining like terms, we get $20x = $120.**

* **To find the number of large stuffed animals sold (x), divide both sides by $20: x = $120 / $20 = 6.**

* **Finally, Teresa sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.**

"Let's break this down step-by-step.  

* **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher** 
   There's a 50% chance Marcus has a substitute, meaning homework isn't collected.

* **Scenario 2: Regular Teacher, No Extension**
   If the regular teacher is there, there's a 60% chance Marcus *doesn't* get an extension (100% - 40%).

* **Scenario 3: Regular Teacher, Extension, Dog Ate It**
   Even if the class doesn't get an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of getting a personal one.

To find the probability Marcus *has* to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he *doesn't* get out of it:

*  Substitute teacher is *not* there (50% chance) AND the regular teacher is there AND no extension is given (60% chance) AND he doesn't convince the teacher about the dog (80% chance).

Multiplying those probabilities together: 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.24

* The third person received twice the amount of the second, so they received 2(x + $80).

*  The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

* Simplifying the equation: x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920

* Combining like terms: 4x + $240 = $1920

"Depreciation is a tricky thing, but we can figure this out.  

Here's how we calculate the car's value in 2010:

* **Year 2008:**  The car loses 21% of its value, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.
   So, the price in 2008 is $20000 - $4200 = $15800.

* **Year 2009:**  Another 21% depreciation hits: $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.
   The price in 2009 is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.

* **Year 2010:**  One more year, another 21% depreciation: $12482 * 0.21 = $2622.62.

"Let's break this fencing problem down.  

If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can represent this mathematically. Let 'x' be the amount of fence Sam gets.  Harry would then get 'x + 60'.

Their total fence adds up to 100 feet, so:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Alright, let's break this down.  To figure out the paint cost, we need to know the total area of the walls.

*  The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so they total 160 square feet (10 * 8 * 2 = 160).
*  The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so they total 80 square feet (5 * 8 * 2 = 80).

*  The total area of all the walls is 240 square feet (160 + 80 = 240).

Now, we know one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.  So, we'll need 12 gallons to cover the whole room (240 / 20 = 12).

"Let's break this down.  We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  

*  First, we need to figure out how many ""groups"" of 5 men and 9 women are in the total of 84 passengers.  Divide the total passengers by the sum of the ratio parts: 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers per part.

*  Now, multiply that number by the women's ratio part: 6 passengers/part * 9 parts = 54 women.

*  Finally, subtract the 20 women who got off: 54 women - 20 women = 34 women.

"To figure this out, we need to consider the energy coverage per bottle and the total energy needs of the people.  

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, they'd need 5 bottles (100% / 20% = 5) to meet their full energy needs.

With 2300 people, that means they'd need a total of 11500 bottles (2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles).

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles, so they'd need to produce an additional 7300 bottles (11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles) to meet the demand.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. 
*  Let's represent the length of the yellow rope with the variable 'y'.

This means:

*  Blue rope length = y - 7
*  Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7)

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Now, let's solve for 'y':

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
* 6y - 35 = 37
* 6y = 72
* y = 12

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

* **Statement 1:** ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""  This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

* **Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""  This gives us: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   3c + 75 = 5c + 35
   40 = 2c
   c = 20

"Let's break this down.  Tim's off by a bit, but we can figure out exactly how far.

First, we need to figure out the total volume of the jar: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Knowing that jelly beans are packed at about 80% efficiency, the usable volume is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

With each jelly bean taking up 0.15 cubic inches, we can calculate the maximum number of jelly beans the jar could hold: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim estimated 30% of those to be red, so he thought there were 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The actual number is 900, so Tim was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans.

"This is a classic example of a system of equations problem.  Here's how to solve it:

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can use substitution to solve for 'c'.  Solving the first equation for 'w', we get:

w = 20 - c

Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5
