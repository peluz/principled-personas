"Here's how to figure out Josh's profit:

First, we need to find the house's value after the repairs increased it by 150%.  That means the value went up by 1.5 times its original price:

*  $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

Now add that increase to the original price:

* $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Next, add the cost of the repairs to find the total investment:

* $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Finally, subtract the total investment from the house's final value to get the profit:

* $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

"Let's break this download problem down:

* **Step 1: Initial Download Time** 
   If Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, a 200 GB file would take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

* **Step 2: Download Progress at Restart**
   The restart happens 40% of the way through, so that's 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes.

* **Step 3: Data Downloaded Before Restart**
   In those 40 minutes, she downloads 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

* **Step 4: Remaining Download Time**
   She has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

* **Step 5: Total Download Time**
   The remaining download takes 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

* **Step 6: Final Calculation**
   Adding the initial download time, restart time, and remaining download time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what remained, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 left in the end, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18

"Let's break this coin problem down.  

*  We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
*  We also know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's use a little algebra to find the number of gold coins:

* Let 's' represent the number of silver coins.
* Let 'g' represent the number of gold coins.

We can set up two equations:

*  s + g = 110  
*  g = s + 30

Since we know 'g' is equal to 's + 30', we can substitute that into the first equation:

* s + (s + 30) = 110

Now, simplify and solve for 's':

* 2s + 30 = 110
* 2s = 80
* s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

* g = s + 30
* g = 40 + 30
* g = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Let's break this down.  Each level is half the size of the one below it.  That means we're dealing with a geometric sequence.

* The top level is 16 square feet.
* The next level down is 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
* The level below that is 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
* And the bottom level is 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

Adding all the levels together, we get 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

"To figure out the number of worker bees, let's break it down:

*  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees. 

*  Let's say there are 'q' queen bees. That means there are '2q' baby bees, and '2 * 2q' or '4q' worker bees.

*  The total number of bees is 700, so  q + 2q + 4q = 700

*  Combining like terms, we get 7q = 700

*  Dividing both sides by 7, we find q = 100 queen bees.

*  With 100 queen bees, there are 2 * 100 = 200 baby bees.

*  Finally, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

"Let's break this down.  

There are 3 numbers on a standard six-sided die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number bigger than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, think of it this way:

* The first roll has to be even (2, 4, or 6), which is a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance.
*  If you get an even number, the second roll also has to be even.  Again, that's a 1/2 chance.

To get the probability of both things happening, we multiply those chances together: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

* He gets 5 pails of water in the morning, and each pail holds 5 liters, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 liters.
* In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.
* Adding the morning and afternoon amounts, he gets 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water each day.

"Well, this is a classic chicken-counting problem!  To figure out how many red chickens Jerry has, we need to think about how many eggs each type of chicken lays.  

Let's say 'r' is the number of red chickens and 'w' is the number of white chickens. We know:

* Each red chicken lays 3 eggs a day.
* Each white chicken lays 5 eggs a day.
* Jerry collects 42 eggs in total each day.

We also know Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens:

* w = r + 2

Now we can set up an equation to represent the total eggs:

* 3r + 5w = 42

We can substitute 'r + 2' for 'w' in the equation:

* 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation:

* 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
* 8r + 10 = 42
* 8r = 32
* r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to figure out the total distance and then divide that by his walking speed.  

The park is a rectangle, so we can find the perimeter (the total distance around the outside) by using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Plugging in the dimensions, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now we know the distance is 15 miles, and Gary walks at 3 miles per hour.  We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

* Junior programmers: 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000
* Senior programmers: 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000

Finally, the total payroll for all programmers is: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

If we represent the size of the two equal groups with the variable 'x', the smallest group would have 'x - 10' students.  

We know the total number of students is 200, so we can set up an equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

"To find the total number of legs, we need to figure out how many legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of animals of that type. 

* Cows have 4 legs each.
* Chickens have 2 legs each.

Let's say there are 'c' cows. That means there are '2c' chickens since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.

The total number of animals is 60: c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60.  

Dividing both sides by 3, we find c = 20 cows.

So, there are 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 cow legs.

And there are 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 chicken legs.

Adding those together, the total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  

1. Solve the first equation for 'c':  c = 180 - d
2. Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

"Let's break down this card trick!  

*  There are 15 red cards, and that's our starting point.
*  Green cards are 60% more than red, so we need to calculate 60% of 15, which is (60/100) * 15 = 9 green cards.
*  Adding the green cards to the red cards, we have 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.
*  Yellow cards are the same number as the total of red and green cards, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down:

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily found 7 more than David.
*  David found half the number of insects Bodhi found.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's say:

*  B = the number of insects Bodhi found
*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We can write these equations based on the information given:

*  L + D + B = 43 
*  L = D + 7
*  D = B / 2

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplifying:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Dividing both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16



Lily found 16 insects.

With the new device, her daily consumption increases to 14 kilowatt-hours, costing 14 times $1.50, or $21.00.

The difference in daily cost is $21.00 - $18.00 = $3.00.

Over a week, this difference amounts to $3.00 per day times 7 days a week, or $21.00.

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since April has 30 days, he needs to figure out how much to save each day to reach his goal.

He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as the first half.  Let's say he saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half. That means he'd save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

Here's the equation to represent his savings:

15x + 30(2x) = $1125

Simplifying:

15x + 60x = $1125
75x = $1125
x = $15

So, Elvis needs to save $15 each day in the first half.  In the second half, he'll save twice that amount, or $30 per day.

"Let's break this jelly bean problem down.  

First, we know there are 4500 jelly beans total.  We can represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 0.99b red jelly beans.  And, there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, meaning there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

Now we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b':

b = 4500 / 2.99

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  If we call the smallest angle 'x', we can represent the other angles as:

*  Second angle: 2x

"Here's how to figure that out:

First, we need to find out how many rotations the tires make in a year.  Since the car makes 725 rotations every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's 400 miles * (725 rotations / 2 miles) = 145,000 rotations per month.

Over a year, that's 145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations per year.

Now, we can divide the tire's total rotations (10,440,000) by the yearly rotations (1,740,000) to find out how many years the tire will last: 10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.

"This is a classic animal puzzle!  To figure out how many sheep Lee has, we can use a little bit of algebra. 

Let's say 's' represents the number of sheep and 'g' represents the number of geese. We know:

*  Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
*  There are a total of 70 legs.
*  There are a total of 20 heads.

We can set up two equations:

*  s + g = 20  (Equation 1: Total heads)
*  4s + 2g = 70 (Equation 2: Total legs)

Now we can solve for 's'.  One way to do this is to solve Equation 1 for 'g' (g = 20 - s) and substitute that value into Equation 2.  Then, we can simplify and solve for 's'.

Following those steps, we find that Lee has **15** sheep.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes.  That means the dog's eating time is (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

The total time it takes for both animals to eat the sausages is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

The average time is the total time divided by the number of animals: 50 minutes / 2 animals = 25 minutes per animal.

*  Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
*  Let Paul's age be represented by 'Pa'
*  Let John's age be represented by 'J'

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  (The total age is 100)
* Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages)

Using substitution, we can solve for Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. Substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50



**Peter's age is 50.**

"Let's break down Fern's widget-making dilemma.  

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  Since each widget sells for $6, we can calculate the daily earnings for each machine:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * $6/widget = $8640/day
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * $6/widget = $6480/day

Over a 30-day month, the earnings would be:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** $8640/day * 30 days/month = $259,200/month
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** $6480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400/month

The difference in monthly earnings is:

* $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"Let's solve this Pokemon problem!

*  Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
*  Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find Stan's Pokemon, we'll use substitution:

1.  Substitute (S + 5) for A and (4W - 13) for S in the first equation:
    (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3. Substitute (4W - 13) for S in the simplified equation:
    2(4W - 13) + W = 334

4. Simplify and solve for W:
    8W - 26 + W = 334
    9W = 360
    W = 40

5. Now that we know W, substitute it back into the equation S = 4W - 13:

    S = 160 - 13
    S = 147

* **High setting:**  It then cools an additional 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours, for a total of 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
* **Total cooling:**  The room is cooled 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
* **Warming:**  With the air conditioner off for 2 hours, the room warms up 2 degrees per hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.
* **Net cooling:**  The final temperature is 18 degrees cooler - 4 degrees warmer = 14 degrees cooler.

"Let's break down this airport scheduling problem.  

The first plane makes 88 flights a day (since the second plane's 44 flights represent half of the first plane's).  

Of those 88 flights, 66 are to Greece (3/4 of the total).  

That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights split between France and Germany.

Since the flights are split equally, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

"Let's break down the howling times:

* Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
* Chikote howls twice as long as Tobias, so he howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* Igneous howls for the same amount of time as Tobias and Chikote combined, which is 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

In total, all three wolves howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

*  Over the next 3 hours, it lost another 21% (7% per hour * 3 hours).

*  The final charge is 28%, so 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.28

"To figure this out, we need to understand the lighthouse's blinking pattern.  If it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, that means it blinks at a consistent rate.  

We can calculate the time it takes for one blink by dividing the total time by the number of blinks: 5 minutes / 255 blinks = 0.0196 minutes per blink (approximately).

Now, to find out how long it takes for 459 blinks, we multiply the time per blink by the desired number of blinks: 0.0196 minutes/blink * 459 blinks = 9 minutes.

*  Let's say 'x' represents the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted each.

*  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so if Sarah painted 'y' eggs, Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.

*  We can set up an equation: x + x + y + (y + 12) = 56

*  Simplifying the equation: 2x + 2y + 12 = 56

*  Further simplification: 2x + 2y = 44

*  We also know y + (y + 12) = 30

*  Combining like terms: 2y + 12 = 30

*  Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2y = 18

*  Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)

*  Now we know Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

*  Finally, to find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we need to find 'x'.  We can use the equation 2x + 2y = 44 and substitute y = 9:

*  2x + 2(9) = 44

*  2x + 18 = 44

*  Subtracting 18 from both sides: 2x = 26

*  Dividing both sides by 2: x = 13 (Arnold painted 13 eggs)

*  Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.  Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

On the sidewalk, her speed is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, to find the time spent on the sidewalk, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.  

She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at 0.1 miles per minute, so it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, to get the total time, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break down this soccer match:

* **First Half:** Team A scores 4 goals, and Team B scores 2 fewer, so they score 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

* **Second Half:** Team B really steps it up, scoring 4 times their first-half total, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of Team B's second-half goals, meaning they score 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

"Let's break this down step-by-step:

*  The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it, leaving him with 55%  (100% - 45% = 55%).

*  That means he has 2.75 inches of chalk left (55% of 5 inches is (55/100) * 5 = 2.75).

*  If he uses 20% of the chalk each day, he'll use 1 inch per day (20% of 5 inches is (20/100) * 5 = 1).

*  Therefore, the chalk will last him 2.75 days (2.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 2.75 days).

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

* Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable 'w'.
* Let Colin's current age be represented by the variable 'c'.

We can formulate two equations based on the information given:

*  Equation 1: w = 5(c + 7)  
*  Equation 2: c + 25 = (1/3)w

To solve for 'c', we can use a substitution method:

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'w':
   w = 5c + 35

2. Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2:
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. Simplify and solve for 'c':

*  Adding the ice cream ($3.50) and the bracelet ($8.50) to the movie tickets, her total spending is $15.00 + $3.50 + $8.50 = $27.00
*  Since her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.

"Let's break this down:

*  Josh services 3 cars each day he's open.
*  He's open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday).
*  That means he services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars per week.
*  He makes $4 per car, so he earns $4/car * 15 cars/week = $60 per week.
*  Over two weeks, he'd make $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

"Let's break down the cookie situation:

* **Start:** Randy has 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.
* **Snack Time:** He eats 3 cookies, leaving him with 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.
* **Lunch:** He eats 2 more oatmeal cookies, so he has 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.
* **Sharing:** Randy gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 13 - 2 = 11 cookies.
* **Baking Bonanza:** He bakes 4 of each kind, so he ends up with 11 + 9 + 4 + 5 = 29 cookies.

"Matthew would earn $72. 

Here's how to figure that out:

* He sells 6 soldiers for $5 each, which is 6 * $5 = $30.
* He sells another 6 soldiers for $7 each, which is 6 * $7 = $42.
*  In total, he makes $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

First, we need to figure out the total number of holes dug: 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Then, we calculate how many holes Nate fills in each day compared to how many the dog digs: 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.

Finally, we determine the number of days it takes to fill all the holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

To find out how many weeks that is, we divide the number of days by the number of days in a week: 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Test tubes:** Igor gathered half the requested amount, so he had 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** He collected two more than requested, meaning he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total before losses:**  Before losing any beakers, Igor had 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 items.
* **Beakers lost:**  Since he ended up with 29 items, he must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Alexandra raised $430.
* Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
* Sarah raised $300.
* Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Finally, to find the total amount raised, we add up everyone's contributions: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Let's break this relay race problem down:

* **Aaron's Speed:** Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Speed:** Vanessa runs at half Aaron's speed, making her speed 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Time:** To find Vanessa's time, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.  Vanessa ran 4 miles at 0.0625 miles per minute, so her time is 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

"To figure out how much line the caretaker needs, we need to determine the total length required and then subtract the line he already has.  

He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock. So, he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line in total.

Since he already has 6 feet, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet more.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

*  Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
*  James is twice Dora's age, making him 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
*  John had James when he was 19, so he is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.
*  John's youngest son was born when he was 32, meaning the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
*  In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Here's how to figure out how many chickens Farmer Brown has:

* **Let's say 'c' is the number of chickens.**
* **And 'w' is the number of cows.**

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (All the animals together make 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4, and all together they have 70 legs)

To find out how many chickens there are, we can use a little algebra.  Let's solve for 'c':

1. **Solve the first equation for 'w':**
   *w = 20 - c*

2. **Substitute that value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   *2c + 4(20 - c) = 70*

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   *2c + 80 - 4c = 70*
   *-2c = -10*
   *c = 5*
