"Okay, let's break down this house flipping scenario. 

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value went up by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what remained:  ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 left over, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18

The sale price is 75% of the original price because a 25% discount means the book is selling for 100% - 25% = 75% of its original cost.

To find the original price, we can set up a simple equation:

0.75 * Original Price = $19.50

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

Let 'x' represent the common factor in this ratio. So, Darrell is 7x years old and Allen is 11x years old.

We're told their total age is 162.  We can set up an equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms:

18x = 162

Now, solve for x:

x = 162 / 18 
x = 9

Allen's current age is 11x, so:

Allen's current age = 11 * 9 = 99

Finally, to find Allen's age in 10 years, simply add 10:

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* 2x + 30 = 110
* 2x = 80
* x = 40  (This means she has 40 silver coins)

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Running Speed:** Since skipping is half her running speed, and she skips at 3 mph, her running speed is 3 mph * 2 = 6 mph.
* **Walking Speed:**  She runs four times faster than she walks, so her walking speed is 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.
* **Distance Covered Running:** She runs for one-third of the time, which is 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours.  Over those 2 hours, she covers 2 hours * 6 mph = 12 miles.
* **Distance Covered Walking:** She walks for two-thirds of the time, which is 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.  In those 4 hours, she covers 4 hours * 1.5 mph = 6 miles.

"To figure out the best deal for Vincent, let's compare the cost per flower:

* **Package of 3:** $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.83 per flower

Since the packages of 2 are cheaper per flower, that's the way to go.  

Vincent needs 18 flowers, so he'll buy 18 / 2 = 9 packages of 2.

That means he'll spend 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

"Okay, let's break down this beehive problem!

We know there are 700 bees total, and the number of worker bees is double the number of baby bees, which is double the number of queens.  

Let's use a little algebra:

* Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

We can set up equations based on the information given:

* b = 2q 
* w = 2b
* q + b + w = 700

Now, we can substitute to solve for 'w':

*  q + 2q + 2(2q) = 700
*  q + 2q + 4q = 700
*  7q = 700
*  q = 100

Since we know q = 100, we can find 'b':

* b = 2q = 2 * 100 = 200

And finally, we can find 'w':

* w = 2b = 2 * 200 = 400

"Hey there!  

This is a classic example of exponential growth.  Since the price increases by 20% every two months, we can think of it as a multiplier.  

The price after two months is $20 * 1.20. After four months, it's $20 * 1.20 * 1.20, and so on.

To find the price after 36 months, we'd calculate:

$20 * (1.20)^(36/2) = $20 * (1.20)^18

*  There are 3 numbers on a standard six-sided die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling one of those.

*  For rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to think about the chances of each roll. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 total. So, the chance of rolling one even number is 1/2.  Since the rolls are independent, we multiply those probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

*  Finally, to find the difference, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

"Let's figure this out!  We can set up a system of equations to represent the situation.

Let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens.

*  Equation 1 (eggs): 3r + 5w = 42 
*  Equation 2 (chickens): w = r + 2

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for 'r':

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

"To figure this out, we need to find the total distance Gary walks, which is the perimeter of the park.  

Perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

So, the perimeter is 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles.

Finally, we can calculate the time it takes Gary to walk the perimeter:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool has now.

* Since the pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, both pools lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes.

* Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool.  Let's say the small pool had 's + 16' gallons then. This means the big pool had 2 * (s + 16) gallons.

* Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.  So, 2 * (s + 16) - 16 = 4 * (s - 16)

* Simplifying the equation: 2s + 32 - 16 = 4s - 64
* Combining like terms: 16 = 2s - 64
* Adding 64 to both sides: 80 = 2s
* Dividing both sides by 2: s = 40


**Answer:** The small pool has 40 gallons now.

"Alright, let's break this down!  

First, we need to figure out how many water-type cards James has left after losing some. He started with 40 and lost 8, so he has 32 water-type cards.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Ruby is currently six times older than Sam.  That means if Sam is 'S' years old, Ruby is '6S' years old.

In nine years, Ruby will be '6S + 9' years old, and Sam will be 'S + 9' years old.  We're told that in nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam.  So we can set up an equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now we can solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6


Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Jogger Jeans Price:** The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which were $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

* **Total Savings:** Cole saved a total of $6.

* **Savings Breakdown:** He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.  Let's say 'x' is the amount saved on the tattered jeans. This means he saved (1/3)*$6 = $2 on the jogger jeans.

* **Finding 'x':**  We know the total savings are $6, so $2 + x = $6.  Therefore, x = $4.

* **Original Jogger Price:** Since he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, their original price was $22 + $2 = $24.

* **Price Difference:** The jogger jeans originally cost $24 - $28 = -$4 more than the tattered jeans.

"To figure this out, we need to find the point where the cost of Venue 1 (flat fee plus food) equals the cost of Venue 2 (per-person fee).

Let's represent the number of guests as 'x'.

* **Venue 1 Cost:** $200 + $5x 
* **Venue 2 Cost:** $25x

Set the costs equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Solve for x:

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down!

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily found 7 more than David.
*  David found half the number of insects Bodhi found.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's say:

*  B = the number of insects Bodhi found
*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We can write these equations based on the information given:

*  L + D + B = 43 
*  L = D + 7
*  D = B / 2

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplifying:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Dividing both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16



**Answer:** Lily found 16 insects.

"Let's break this down.  If the house costs three times the lot, we can represent this with an equation:

*  House cost = 3 * Lot cost

We know the total cost is $120,000, so:

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month, we can set up an equation to represent this.

Let 'x' be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.  

* Savings in the first half: 15x 
* Savings in the second half: 30 * (2x) = 60x

Combining like terms:

75x = $1125

Now, solve for x:

x = $1125 / 75 
x = $15

"Hey there!  Kai here, your friendly neighborhood math whiz.  

To figure this out, we need to break it down step-by-step. Let's say the number Diane started with is ""n"".

1. **Half the number:** n/2

2. **Starting value plus half the number:** n + n/2 = (3/2)n

3. **Divide by 5:** (3/2)n / 5 = (3/10)n

4. **Multiply by starting value minus 12:** (3/10)n * (n - 12)

5. **Simplify:** (3/10)n² - (18/5)n


So the final value of the number train is **(3/10)n² - (18/5)n**.  We need to know the original number (n) to get a specific numerical answer.

"Let's break this jelly bean problem down!

First, we know there are 4500 jelly beans total.  Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 0.99b red jelly beans.  And, there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, meaning there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

We can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b':

b = 4500 / 2.99 
b ≈ 1505

Now we can find the number of green jelly beans:

1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

And the number of red jelly beans:

0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490

Finally, the difference between green and red jelly beans is:

"Let's break this fish problem down!  

* Bob started with 4 white fish and 3 orange fish.
* He wants twice as many orange fish as white fish after buying more.  
*  Let's say he bought 'w' white fish and 'o' orange fish.

We know:

*  w + o = 17 (total fish bought)
*  o = 2w (twice as many orange as white)

We can use substitution to solve for 'w':

1. Since o = 2w, substitute '2w' for 'o' in the first equation: w + 2w = 17
2. Combine like terms: 3w = 17
3. Divide both sides by 3: w = 5.67

Since Bob can't buy parts of fish, he must have bought **5** white fish.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let your brother's age be 'b'
*  Let your sister's age be 's'
*  Let your age be 'y'

We know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87

Simplifying the last equation: 4b + y + s = 88

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Combining like terms: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

Now, substitute 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

*  Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
*  Let Paul's age be represented by 'Pa'
*  Let John's age be represented by 'J'

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  (The total age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100)
* Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages)

Now, we can use substitution to find Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the third equation:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. Substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50



**Peter's age is 50.**

"Let's figure this out!  

First, we need to figure out how many plants Pat needs.  She has 111 feet of flower bed and each plant needs 12 inches of space, plus 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant.  

So, the total space needed for plants is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot - 18 inches = 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

That means Pat needs 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since she can't have half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558 at the store.

* Bill's dad saw it when he was 30.
* Bill saw it again when he was three times his father's age, meaning he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet returns every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.  Therefore, Bill's age when he saw it the first time (let's call it 'x') can be found by subtracting the time difference from his second sighting age:

90 - 75 = x

So, x = 15.

"Let's break this watermelon problem down!

Each adult gets twice the slice of a kid, so we can think of it like this:

*  Kids' slices = 4x
*  Adults' slices = 2 * 4x = 8x

Since the whole watermelon is divided into 6 slices, we have:

4x + 8x = 6

Combining like terms:

12x = 6

Solving for x:

x = 6 / 12 = 0.5

Now, each adult gets 8x = 8 * 0.5 = 4 slices.

To find the percentage, we divide the adult's share by the total slices and multiply by 100%:

(4 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 66.67%

"Let's break this down.  We know there are 50 porcupines total, and 3/5 of them are female. That means there are 30 female porcupines.

Since each female has 4 babies a month, in a year (12 months) they'll have 4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies each.

So, 30 females * 48 babies/female = 1440 babies born in a year.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the amount the first person received.

* The second person received x + $80.

* The third person received 2 * (x + $80).

Since the total amount is $1920, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Simplifying the equation:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920
4x + $240 = $1920
4x = $1680
x = $420



The first person received **$420**.

"Let's break this tennis ball problem down:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory got in the second set.

*  The first set had 'x + 4' balls.

*  The third set had 'x / 2' balls.

We know the total is 19 balls:  x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
3. Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

Finally, find the number of balls in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"Depreciation is a tricky thing, but we can figure this out.  

Here's how we calculate the car's value in 2010:

* **Year 2008:**  The car loses 21% of its value, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.
   So, the price in 2008 is $20000 - $4200 = $15800.

* **Year 2009:**  Another 21% depreciation hits: $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.
   The price in 2009 is $15800 - $3318 = $12482.

* **Year 2010:**  One more year, another 21% depreciation: $12482 * 0.21 = $2622.62.
   Finally, the price in 2010 is $12482 - $2622.62 = $9859.38.

*  Together they painted 2x eggs.
*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs in total, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let Sarah's eggs be represented by 'y'. This means Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.
*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30
*  Combining like terms: 2y + 12 = 30
*  Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2y = 18
*  Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)
*  Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
*  We also know that 2x + 30 = 56 (total eggs painted)

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Starting Point:** Thomas begins with $1000, which is equal to 1000 / 20 = 50 twenty-dollar bills.

* **Loss:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

* **Payment:** He uses half his remaining bills, paying with 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

* **Tripling:**  He triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

* **Conversion:**  Since each bill is worth $20, he has a total of 60 * $20 = $1200. Converting this to five-dollar bills, he has $1200 / $5 = 240 five-dollar bills.

"Alright, let's break down this soccer match!

Team A scored 4 goals in the first half, and Team B scored 2 fewer than that, so they scored 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B really stepped it up, scoring 4 times their first-half total, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.  Team A scored 1/4 of Team B's second-half goals, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up all the goals:

* Team A: 4 + 2 = 6 goals
* Team B: 2 + 8 = 10 goals
* Total: 6 + 10 = 16 goals

"Let's break this down:

* The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday, leaving him with 55%  (100% - 45% = 55%).

*  55% of 5 inches is (55/100) * 5 = 2.75 inches of chalk remaining.

*  He uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is (20/100) * 5 = 1 inch per day.

*  Therefore, the chalk will last 2.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 2.75 days.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

* **Statement 1:** ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""  This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

* **Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""  This gives us: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   3c + 75 = 5c + 35
   40 = 2c
   c = 20

"Let's break this down.  John's spending on scotch is straightforward: 10 bottles at $60 each equals $600.

The cognac is a bit trickier.  Since each bottle costs 50% more than the scotch, we need to calculate that markup.  50% of $60 is $30, so each cognac bottle costs $60 + $30 = $90.

With twice as many cognac bottles as scotch, he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  That brings his total cognac spending to 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

* Let 's' represent the number of strawberry ice cubes.
*  The number of blueberry ice cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write that as 5s - 4.
*  The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Now we can solve for 's':

* Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116
* Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120
* Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

Finally, substitute the value of 's' back into the expression for blueberry cubes:

* Blueberry cubes = 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

*  *2c + 4w = 70* (Total legs)

We can solve for *c* using substitution.  From the first equation, we know *w = 20 - c*.  Let's plug that into the second equation:

*2c + 4(20 - c) = 70*

Simplify and solve for *c*:

*2c + 80 - 4c = 70*
*-2c = -10*
*c = 5*
