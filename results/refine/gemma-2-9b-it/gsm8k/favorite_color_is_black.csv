* **Return trip:**
    *  He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    *  He then drives 30 miles per hour for half an hour (0.5 hours), covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

"Let's break this problem down.  

*  Melanie started with some number of vacuum cleaners, which we can call 'x'.

*  She sold a third of them at the green house, leaving her with (2/3)x.

*  Then she sold 2 more at the red house, so she had (2/3)x - 2 left.

*  Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is  ((2/3)x - 2) / 2.

*  We know she has 5 left over, so: ((2/3)x - 2) / 2 = 5

Now we can solve for x:

1. Multiply both sides by 2: (2/3)x - 2 = 10
2. Add 2 to both sides: (2/3)x = 12
3. Multiply both sides by (3/2): x = 18

"Let's break this down:

*  First, we find out how many students chose contemporary dance: 20 students * 20% = 4 students.

*  That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.

*  Next, we see how many of those 16 students chose jazz: 16 students * 25% = 4 students.

*  Finally, the rest must have chosen hip-hop: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students.

*  To find the percentage of the whole class who chose hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of students: 12 students / 20 students = 0.6

*  Converting that decimal to a percentage, we get 0.6 * 100% = 60%

"Let's break this down.  We have 10 liters of orange drink that's 2/3 water, so there are (2/3) * 10 = 6.67 liters of water in it.  The pineapple drink has 15 liters and is 3/5 water, meaning there are (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters of water in that.

Now, we lose 1 liter of the orange drink, which means we lose 1/3 of a liter of water from the orange drink (since it's 2/3 water).  

So, we have 6.67 - (1/3) = 6.33 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters from the pineapple drink, for a total of 6.33 + 9 = 15.33 liters of water.

Think of it like this: if $19.50 represents 75 out of every 100 dollars, we can set up a proportion to find the whole:

75/100 = $19.50 / x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

75x = $1950

Now, divide both sides by 75 to isolate x:

x = $1950 / 75

*  We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
*  We also know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Think of it like this: if we let 'x' represent the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins would be 'x + 30'.

Cecilia's pup needs 1 cup a day for the first 180 days, which is 180 cups total.  After that, it's 2 cups a day for the rest of its life.  

In the first year, that's 180 cups + (365 days - 180 days) * 2 cups/day = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

"To figure out Vincent's savings, we need to see which way gets him the best price per flower.

*  Packages of 3: $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.83 per flower
*  Packages of 2: $1.00 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Buying in packages of 2 is cheaper.  Let's see how much 18 flowers cost that way:

* 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
* 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

Now, let's see how much it would cost buying in packages of 3:

* 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
* 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

Vincent saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by buying in packages of 2.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know both pools are losing water at a constant rate.  

* Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool has now.

* Since the big pool has four times the water of the small pool now, it has 4s gallons.

* Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool.  Let's say the small pool had 's + 16' gallons four minutes ago (because it lost 16 gallons). This means the big pool had 2(s + 16) gallons four minutes ago.

*  We can set up an equation: 2(s + 16) - 16 = 4s - 16

* Simplifying the equation: 2s + 32 - 16 = 4s - 16
*  Combining like terms: 2s + 16 = 4s - 16
*  Solving for 's': 32 = 2s
*  Therefore, s = 16

"Let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out how many water-type cards James has left after losing some.  He started with 40 and lost 8, so he has 32 water-type cards.

Next, we need to know the total number of cards he has now.  He had 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water, for a total of 90 cards.  Then he bought 14 more grass cards, bringing his total to 96 cards.

Now we can calculate the percentage of water-type cards: (32 water cards / 96 total cards) * 100% = 33.33%.

Rounding that to the nearest integer, the chance of picking a water-type card is 33%.

* He spends half his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.  He buys 40 gumballs.

First, figure out how much he spent on gumballs: 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since he spent half his change on gumballs, he had $2.00 * 2 = $4.00 in change before buying gumballs.

This means he spent $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00 on candy.

* **Joanne's Average Apples:**  Since the sisters collected 500 apples total, Joanne must have picked 500 - 105 = 395 apples.  Subtracting her apples from the tallest and shortest trees, she got 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Let's break this down.  We know there are 180 heads total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of camels
*  Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries

* Equation 1: c + d = 180  (Total heads)
* Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (Total bumps)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  Solve Equation 1 for 'c':

c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

360 - 2d + d = 304
-d = -56
d = 56

Here's the breakdown:

* Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per horse per day.
* With four horses, that's 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.
* Over five days, he'll need 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.
* Since each bag has 50 pounds, he'll need 200 / 50 = 4 bags.

"Let's break this insect-counting puzzle down:

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily was a bit of a bug enthusiast and found 7 more than David.
*  David, well, he's more of a casual collector, finding only half the amount Bodhi did.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's represent:

* Bodhi's insects as 'B'
* David's insects as 'D'
* Lily's insects as 'L'

We can set up equations based on the information given:

* L + D + B = 43 
* L = D + 7
* D = B / 2

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplifying:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Dividing both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16



Lily found 16 insects.

"The sun's apparent movement is relative to the observer's position.  Since the sun is moving 5 degrees upward each hour, and it starts at the tip of the pyramid, after 10 hours it will have moved 50 degrees from its initial position.  

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 degrees (the pyramid's angle) + 50 degrees (the sun's movement) = 82 degrees.

"Here's how to figure out the correct oven temperature:

The oven is running 18 degrees hotter than it should be at 450 degrees.  That means it's off by a percentage. To find that percentage, we can do a little calculation:

(18 degrees / 450 degrees) * 100% = 4%

So, the oven is consistently 4% hotter than the set temperature.  

To get 520 degrees in the oven, Maggie needs to set it to a lower temperature.  Let's call that temperature 'x'.

The actual temperature will be x + (0.04x) = 520

Combining like terms: 1.04x = 520

To isolate x, divide both sides by 1.04:

x = 520 / 1.04

"This is a classic ratio problem.  Let's break it down:

* **Blue jelly beans:**  We'll call this 'b' 
* **Red jelly beans:** 1% fewer than blue, so 0.99b
* **Green jelly beans:** 1% more than blue, so 1.01b

*  Now, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 0.02 Mb/s by 60 seconds/minute and then by 60 minutes/hour.

That gives us 7.2 Mb/hour.

*  Then it pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the rest of the week, meaning 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.
*  There are 7 days in a week, so there were 7 - 3 = 4 days left.
*  Over those 4 days, the truck towed 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

*  Adding those together, the total is 30 + 24 = 54 cars.

"Let's break down this car sales commission problem:

* **Revenue:** James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, so his total revenue was 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

* **Cost:** The company paid 30% of the car price to acquire them, meaning the cost was $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

* **Profit:**  Profit is revenue minus cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

* **Commission:** James earns a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.



**Answer:** James made $17,500.

* **Betty:** 30% more than Adam, so 50 * 0.30 = 15 extra points. Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.
* **Tom:** 30 points less than Betty, meaning Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let your brother's age be ""b""
*  Let your sister's age be ""s""
*  Let your age be ""y""

We know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87

Simplifying the last equation: 4b + y + s = 88

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Combining like terms: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

Now, substitute 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

"Let's break down the calorie count of Andrew's pastries:

* **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:** A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini one is 1/3rd that size, so each mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.  With 200 mini rolls, the total calorie count for cinnamon rolls is 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

* **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**  Similarly, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories.  With 300 mini muffins, the total calorie count for blueberry muffins is 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

*  Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
*  Let Paul's age be represented by 'Pa'
*  Let John's age be represented by 'J'

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  (The total age is 100)
* Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages)

Using substitution:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the third equation:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now, substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. Substitute J = 20 back into P = 2J + 10 to find Peter's age:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50



**Peter's age is 50.**

"Let's break down this widget production problem.  

The Widgeteer 3000 churns out 60 widgets per hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000 manages 45.  Since each widget sells for $6, we need to calculate the earnings for each machine over a month.

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * $6/widget = $8640 per day.
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * $6/widget = $6480 per day.

Now, multiply those daily earnings by 30 days to get the monthly totals:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** $8640/day * 30 days/month = $259,200/month
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** $6480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400/month

Finally, subtract the WidgetMaster 9000's earnings from the Widgeteer 3000's to find the difference:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"Let's crack this Pokemon case.  We know the total number of Pokemon caught is 339.  

* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex caught 'S + 5' Pokemon.
* Stan caught 13 less than four times the number Adelwolfe caught, which can be written as '4W - 13', where 'W' is the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

Now we can set up an equation:

S + (S + 5) + (4W - 13) = 339

Simplifying the equation:

2S + 4W - 8 = 339

2S + 4W = 347

We need to find 'S', so let's try to express 'W' in terms of 'S'.  We know Stan caught 13 less than four times Adelwolfe's catch, so:

S = 4W - 13

Solving for 'W':

W = (S + 13) / 4

Substitute this value of 'W' back into the equation 2S + 4W = 347:

2S + 4 * ((S + 13) / 4) = 347

Simplifying:

2S + S + 13 = 347

3S + 13 = 347

3S = 334

S = 111.33


Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, there must be an error in the problem statement.  It's impossible for Stan to have caught this number of Pokemon given the other information.

"Let's figure this out.  To determine how many plants Pat needs, we first need to know how much space each plant takes up.  She needs 1.5 feet between each plant, so that's 18 inches.  

With a flower bed 111 feet long, that's 1332 inches total.  

Subtracting the space between plants, we get 1314 inches of space for the plants themselves.  

Dividing the total space by the space per plant (12 inches), we find Pat needs 109.5 plants. Since you can't have half a plant, she'll need to buy 110.

Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 93 more.

At $6 per plant, that's 93 * $6 = $558.

"Let's break this down.  

Each adult gets a slice twice the size of a kid's slice.  We can think of this as a ratio.  If a kid's slice is represented by 'x', an adult's slice is '2x'.

The total watermelon is divided into 6 slices, so:

4x (kids' slices) + 2 * 2x (adults' slices) = 6

Simplifying the equation:

4x + 4x = 6
8x = 6
x = 0.75

This means each kid's slice is 0.75 of the whole watermelon.

An adult's slice is 2x, so they get 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

To find the percentage, we divide the adult's share by the total and multiply by 100%:

(1.5 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 25%

Now, we know the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to figure out the gallons needed.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much water Wanda pumped on the first day: (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.

Then, we can calculate how much Ms. B pumped on the first day: (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons on the second day.

Adding those amounts, the total pumped on the second day is 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

Finally, to find the total water pumped over the two days, we add the amounts from each day: 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

Subtracting the total pumped from the tank's capacity, we find the remaining amount: 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break this down.  If each small stuffed animal costs $4, and Teresa sold twice as many small ones as large ones, we can set up an equation. 

Let 's' represent the number of small stuffed animals.

* Earnings from small stuffed animals: 4s
*  Let 'l' represent the number of large stuffed animals.
* Earnings from large stuffed animals: 3 * 4 * l = 12l
* Total earnings: 4s + 12l = 120

We also know that s = 2l (twice as many small as large).  

Substitute '2l' for 's' in the total earnings equation:

4(2l) + 12l = 120

Simplify and solve for 'l':

8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120
l = 6

Now that we know Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small ones:

s = 2l = 2 * 6 = 12

"Let's break down this horse racing problem:

* **Race 1:**  He lost $5.  
* **Race 2:** He won $1 more than twice his loss in Race 1, so he won (2 * $5) + $1 = $11.
* **Race 3:** He lost 1.5 times his winnings from Race 2, meaning he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

To find his total loss, we add up his losses: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50

Finally, his average loss per race is $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

* The second person got x + $80.

* The third person received twice the amount of the second, so they got 2(x + $80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Simplifying the equation:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920

* **Year 2008:**  The car loses 21% of its value, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  So, it's worth $20000 - $4200 = $15800.

* **Year 2009:**  Another 21% depreciation hits, meaning it loses $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  That leaves us with $15800 - $3318 = $12482.

* **Year 2010:**  One more year, another 21% hit: $12482 * 0.21 = $2622.62.  The final value is $12482 - $2622.62 = $9859.38.

* **Her desired retirement income:**  How much money does she need each year to live comfortably?
* **Her expected investment returns:**  Will her savings grow over time?

With that information, we could calculate how much she needs to save each year to reach her goal and then determine the number of years needed based on her current savings rate.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total ribbon length by the total number of smaller cuts.

*  There are 4 initial cuts, and each of those is divided into 5 smaller parts, so there are 4 * 5 = 20 final cuts.

*  The total ribbon length is 100 centimeters, so each final cut will be 100 centimeters / 20 cuts = 5 centimeters long.

* Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.
* Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs, and Sarah painted 'y' eggs.

We can set up these equations:

* 2x + y + (y + 12) = 56  (Total eggs)
* y + (y + 12) = 30 (Camden and Sarah's eggs)

Solving the second equation:

* 2y + 12 = 30

* **Rissa's remaining funds:** Rissa had $15 and gave away 'x', leaving her with $15 - x. We know this is equal to 4/5 of her original amount: $15 - x = (4/5) * $15

* **Solving for x:**
    * $15 - x = $12
    * -x = -3
    * x = $3

* **Ronnie's remaining money:** Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.  

* Let 's' represent the number of strawberry ice cubes.
* The number of blueberry ice cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write that as 5s - 4.
* The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Now we can solve for 's':

* Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116
* Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120
* Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

Finally, substitute the value of 's' back into the expression for blueberry cubes:

* Blueberry cubes = 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"Let's break this relay race problem down:

* **Aaron's Pace:** Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Pace:** Vanessa runs at half Aaron's speed, meaning she covers 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Time:** To run her 4 miles, Vanessa takes 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

"Let's break this down.  The vendor made a 25% profit on his investment of $80.  That means his profit was $20 (25% of $80).  

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we add the profit to the original cost: $80 + $20 = $100.

Finally, divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2 per watermelon.

"This is a classic problem about animal husbandry.  

Let's break it down:

* We know there are 20 animals total.
* Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
* Together, they have 70 legs.

We can set up a system of equations to solve for the number of chickens:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of chickens
*  Let 'w' represent the number of cows

* Equation 1: c + w = 20 
* Equation 2: 2c + 4w = 70

Solving for 'c', we get:

*  c = 5
