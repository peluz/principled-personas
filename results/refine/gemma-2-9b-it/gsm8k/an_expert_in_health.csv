*  She had (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left after the green and red houses.
*  She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house, which is ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.
*  This leaves her with 5 vacuum cleaners: (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5
*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to first figure out his current age.  We know the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.  This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

Let's represent their combined age as a whole number,  'y'.  We can set up the following equation:

7x + 11x = y

Since their total age is 162, we can substitute:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms:

18x = 162

Solving for x:

x = 9

Now we know that 'x' represents a portion of their ages. To find Allen's current age, we multiply his ratio (11x) by x:

Allen's current age = 11 * 9 = 99

Finally, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10:

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109

"To solve this problem, we can think of it like balancing a scale.  

* Let 's' represent the number of silver coins.
* Let 'g' represent the number of gold coins.

We know:

*  s + g = 110 (The total weight on both sides of the scale is 110 coins)
*  g = s + 30 (The gold side is 30 coins heavier than the silver side)

We can substitute the second equation into the first:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

g = s + 30

g = 40 + 30

g = 70



Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To figure out the number of worker bees, we need to understand the relationships within the hive.  

Let's break it down:

* **Queens:** These are the reproductive females.
* **Babies:** These are the developing bees, likely larvae.
* **Workers:** These are the busy bees responsible for tasks like collecting nectar, building the hive, and caring for the young.

The problem states there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.  We can use this information to set up a simple equation:

* If there are 'q' queens, there are '2q' babies.
* And since there are twice as many workers as babies, there are '2 * 2q' or '4q' worker bees.

Finally, the total number of bees is 700:

* q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combining like terms:

* 7q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7:

* q = 100

Now we know there are 100 queens.  

To find the number of worker bees:

* w = 4q = 4 * 100 = 400

"While I'm an expert in health, this problem involves a simple calculation of tree growth and mortality.  

Here's how to solve it:

* **Annual tree change:** Tom plants 10 trees and removes 2, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees per year.
* **Total increase over 10 years:** Over 10 years, this adds up to 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
* **Total trees before mortality:**  Starting with 50 trees, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.
* **Trees lost to mortality:** 30% of 130 trees is (30/100) * 130 = 39 trees.
* **Final number of trees:**  Subtracting the losses, he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

"To figure out the score Brinley needs, we need to think about averages.  An average is found by adding up all the numbers in a set and then dividing by the total number of numbers. 

Let's say Brinley's sixth test score is represented by the variable 'x'.  We know she wants an average of 93 across six tests.  This can be set up as an equation:

(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) / 6 = 93

To solve for 'x', we can follow these steps:

1. **Add up the known scores:** 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
2. **Multiply both sides of the equation by 6:**  (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) = 558
3. **Substitute the sum of the known scores:** 438 + x = 558

"This is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using a system of equations.  Let's break it down:

* Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

We know:

*  Each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, and each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day.
*  Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs each day.
*  Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can express this information mathematically:

*  Equation 1: 3r + 5w = 42 (Total eggs)
*  Equation 2: w = r + 2 (Number of chickens)

To solve for 'r', we can use substitution.  Substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

* 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

* 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
* 8r + 10 = 42
* 8r = 32
* r = 4



**Answer:** Jerry has 4 red chickens.

*  Both pools lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons each.
* Now the small pool has x - 16 gallons.
* The big pool has 2x - 16 gallons.
* We know the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool: 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Solving for x:

* 2x - 16 = 4x - 64
* 48 = 2x
* x = 24

Therefore, the small pool now has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

"To figure this out, we can think of it like a balanced equation.  Let 'd' represent the number of players on defense.  

* Offense: Since there are twice as many offensive players as defensive players, there are 2*d* on offense.
* Special Teams:  Half the number of players are on special teams compared to defense, so there are *d*/2 on special teams.

* Total Players:  The total number of players is the sum of all three groups: d + 2d + d/2 = 105

Now we can solve for 'd':

1. Combine like terms: (5/2)d = 105
2. Multiply both sides by 2/5: d = 42

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  We know there are 200 students total and they are divided into three groups.
*  Two of the groups have an equal number of students.
*  The smallest group has 10 fewer students than the larger groups.

Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the larger groups.  The equation to represent this is:

Simplifying the equation:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

"To determine the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of each animal and their respective leg count.  

* Cows have 4 legs each.
* Chickens have 2 legs each.

Let's assume 'c' represents the number of cows and 'ch' represents the number of chickens. We know:

* c + ch = 60  (total animals)
* ch = 2c (twice as many chickens as cows)

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

* c + 2c = 60
* 3c = 60
* c = 20 cows

Therefore, there are 40 chickens (2 * 20).

Finally, calculate the total legs:

* Cows: 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* Chickens: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs
* Total legs: 80 legs + 80 legs = 160 legs

"To solve this problem, we can use a bit of simple math. 

*  Half the class likes blue, so that's 40 pupils / 2 = 20 pupils.
*  That leaves 40 pupils - 20 pupils = 20 pupils who don't like blue.
*  One-fourth of those like green, so 20 pupils / 4 = 5 pupils like green.
*  Therefore, 20 pupils - 5 pupils = 15 pupils like yellow.

"While I'm an expert in health, I can help with this calculation! 

To figure out Karan's monthly payment, we need to consider the principal amount, the interest rate, and the loan term.  

Here's how to break it down:

* **Principal:** $3650
* **Interest Rate:** 10% per year
* **Loan Term:** 5 months

First, we need to calculate the total interest Karan will pay:

* Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
* Interest = ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 
* Interest = $1825

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount she needs to repay:

* Total Amount = Principal + Interest
* Total Amount = $3650 + $1825
* Total Amount = $5475

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find her monthly payment:

* Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
* Monthly Payment = $5475 / 5
* Monthly Payment = $1095

"To determine the difference in popsicle consumption between Betty and Sam, we need to understand the concept of proportional representation.  

The ratio 5:6 indicates that for every 5 popsicles Betty consumes, Sam consumes 6.  Since their total popsicle consumption is 165, we can think of this as 11 parts (5 + 6) representing the total.  

Therefore, each ""part"" represents 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles.

This means Sam consumes 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles, while Betty consumes 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles.

The difference in popsicle consumption is 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 popsicles.

* **Sister's tallest trees:** Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 30 * 2 = 60 apples.

* **Sister's shortest trees:**  She gathered three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

* **Total sister's apples:**  The sister gathered a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Joanne's total (excluding average):** Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

We can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries) using substitution or elimination.  Let's use substitution:

1. Solve the first equation for 'c': c = 180 - d
2. Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304
3. Simplify and solve for 'd': 360 - 2d + d = 304  =>  -d = -56  =>  d = 56

"Let's break this down.  

To find the perimeter, we need the length and width of the room. We know the length is 3 yards, which is equal to 9 feet (since there are 3 feet in a yard).  We can find the width using the area:

* Area = length * width
* 360 square feet = 9 feet * width
* width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Now we can calculate the perimeter:

"To solve this problem, we can use a bit of logic and some simple algebra.  

Let's break it down:

* **Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.**
* **Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.**
* **Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.**

We know:

*  L + D + B = 43  (Total insects)
*  L = D + 7       (Lily found 7 more than David)
*  D = B / 2        (David found half of what Bodhi found)

We can use substitution to solve for L:

1. Since L = D + 7, we can substitute (D + 7) for L in the first equation:
   (D + 7) + D + B = 43

2.  Simplify:
   2D + B + 7 = 43

3.  Since D = B/2, substitute (B/2) for D:
   2(B/2) + B + 7 = 43

4. Simplify further:
   B + B + 7 = 43

5. Combine like terms:
   2B + 7 = 43

6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   2B = 36

7. Divide both sides by 2:
   B = 18  (Bodhi found 18 insects)

8. Now that we know B, we can find D:
   D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 (David found 9 insects)

9. Finally, find L:
   L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 (Lily found 16 insects)



**Answer:** Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the age of one of the twins, we need to set up a system of equations.  

Let 't' represent the age of one triplet.

Let 'tw' represent the age of one twin.

We know:

*  tw = t + 7  (The twin is 7 years older than the triplet)
*  tw + tw + t + t + t = 44 (The combined ages of all five children)

Simplifying the second equation:

* 2tw + 3t = 44

Substituting 't + 7' for 'tw' in the simplified equation:

* 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Solving for 't':

* 2t + 14 + 3t = 44
* 5t + 14 = 44
* 5t = 30
* t = 6

Finding the age of one twin:

* tw = t + 7
* tw = 6 + 7
* tw = 13

$40 + 0.60x = x

0.40x = $40

x = $100

Therefore, the total bill is $100.  Since John brought $125, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

To find out how many students like video games, we need to consider the total number of students and subtract those who enjoy baking or basketball.  

*  We know 10 students like to bake and 5 like basketball. That's a total of 10 + 5 = 15 students.
*  With 50 students in the class,  50 - 15 = 35 students are left who like either video games or music.

The problem tells us that twice as many students like music as basketball.  So, if 5 like basketball, then 5 * 2 = 10 like music.

Finally, we can determine the number of students who like video games: 35 - 10 = 25 students.

"To determine the amount of oil used in this salt scrub, we need to consider the ratios of ingredients.  

Let's break it down:

* **Citrus Zest and Fragrance:** These are used in equal amounts.
* **Salt and Sugar:** These are also used in equal amounts.
* **Oil:** The recipe calls for twice the amount of oil compared to salt.

Since the total scrub fills a 10-ounce jar, and the ingredients are used in specific ratios, we can solve for the amount of each ingredient.  

Let 'x' represent the amount of citrus zest and fragrance.  

* **Salt and Sugar:**  Also 'x' ounces each.
* **Oil:** Twice the amount of salt, so 2x ounces.

The total ounces used is: x + x + x + 2x = 10

"To solve this problem, we can use a bit of algebraic thinking.  Let's represent the number of books each person has with variables:

*  Let 'F' represent the number of books Fawn has.
*  Let 'A' represent the number of books Anne has.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of books Sofie has.

We know the following:

*  S + A + F = 85  (The total number of books)
*  S = A + 25   (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
*  A = F - 12    (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can use substitution to solve for F.  Let's substitute the values of A and S from the second and third equations into the first equation:

(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

Now, simplify and solve for F:

3F + 1 = 85
3F = 84
F = 28



**Answer:** Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine Peter's age, we need to consider the relationships between their ages.  

Let's break down the information:

* **Combined Age:** Peter, Paul, and Jean's combined age is 100 years.
* **Paul's Age:** Paul is 10 years older than John.
* **Peter's Age:** Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Using these clues, we can set up an equation to solve for Peter's age (P):

1.  Let John's age be represented by ""J"".
2.  Paul's age is ""J + 10"".
3.  Peter's age is ""J + (J + 10)"" which simplifies to ""2J + 10"".

Now we know:

P + (J + 10) + J = 100

Substitute ""2J + 10"" for P:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 20

Now that we know John's age (J = 20), we can find Peter's age:

P = 2J + 10
P = (2 * 20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50



**Peter's age is 50.**

* **Goats:** Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and there are 15 goats. So, they'll need 5 * 15 = 75 pounds of hay.

* **Sheep:** Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs.  Twice the amount a goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.  Subtracting 3 pounds, we get 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep. With 12 sheep, they'll need 7 * 12 = 84 pounds of hay.

"To determine the total time it takes James to cross the lake, we need to consider the different phases of his journey:

* **Phase 1: Initial Swim:**  He swims 60% of the lake's distance, which is 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles. At a speed of 2 miles per hour, this takes 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

* **Phase 2: Rest:** He rests for half the time he spent swimming, so he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* **Phase 3: Final Swim:** He swims the remaining 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.  However, he swims at half his usual speed, meaning he swims at 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. This takes 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

"It's important to note that sleepwalking, or somnambulism, can be a complex issue.  While we can calculate the time Kim spent in bed, it's crucial to remember that sleep quality and the impact of sleepwalking on her overall health are more important than just the duration. 

To answer your question directly, here's how we can calculate Kim's time asleep in bed:

*  She typically sleeps from 10:00 pm to 6:00 am, which is 8 hours.
*  Converting that to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
*  She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, at 5:55 am.
*  She sleepwalked for 23 minutes (from 2:15 am to 2:38 am).

"While I'm an expert in health, this problem involves a bit of math! Let's solve it:

Let's use variables to represent the number of Pokemon each person caught:

*  A = Alex's Pokemon
*  S = Stan's Pokemon
*  W = Adelwolfe's Pokemon

We know:

* A + S + W = 339  (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5         (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13       (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find Stan's Pokemon (S), we can use substitution:

1. Substitute (S + 5) for A and (4W - 13) for S in the first equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
   2S + W = 334

3. Substitute (S + 13) / 4 for W:
   2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

4. Multiply both sides by 4:
   8S + S + 13 = 1336

5. Combine like terms:
   9S + 13 = 1336

6. Subtract 13 from both sides:
   9S = 1323

7. Divide both sides by 9:
   S = 147

"To determine the time it takes to prepare 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and cooking times. 

Let's break it down:

* **Peeling:** Assuming Emily peels at a consistent rate, it would take her 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes to peel all the shrimp.

* **Cooking:**  Since she cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, it would take her 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/10 minutes * 10 minutes = 30 minutes to cook all the shrimp.

* **Total Time:**  The total time required is the sum of peeling and cooking times: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

"This is a classic age word problem!  Let's break it down:

*  Let Bill's age at his first sighting of the comet be represented by the variable 'x'.

*  We know Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet. Bill saw it again when he was three times his father's age, meaning he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

*  Since the comet returns every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.

*  This means Bill's age at his second sighting (90) minus his age at his first sighting (x) equals 75: 90 - x = 75

*  Solving for x: x = 90 - 75 = 15

"Let's think of this problem like a recipe.  

*  Donovan's cooking time is one ingredient, and Betsy's is another. 
*  Together, they make up the total cooking time of 98 minutes.

If we let 'x' represent Donovan's time, Betsy's time is 'x + 18' minutes longer.  We can set up an equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Now, we can solve for x:

2x + 18 = 98
2x = 80
x = 40

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

*  We know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30.  
*  Let's represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted as 'x'.
*  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's represent Sarah's eggs as 'y'. Camden would have painted 'y + 12' eggs.
*  We can set up the following equations:
    *  x + x = 56 - (y + y + 12)  (Total eggs = Arnold & Madeline's eggs + Camden & Sarah's eggs)
    *  y + (y + 12) = 30 

*  Simplifying the equations:
    *  2x = 44 - 2y
    *  2y + 12 = 30

*  Solving for 'y' in the second equation:
    *  2y = 18
    *  y = 9

*  Substituting the value of 'y' back into the first equation:
    *  2x = 44 - 2(9)
    *  2x = 44 - 18
    *  2x = 26
    *  x = 13

"It's great that Grandma is staying active with her daily walks!  To figure out how long her entire walk takes, we need to consider both the beach and sidewalk portions. 

We know she walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain pace and 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice that pace.  Since we're given the time spent on the beach (40 minutes), we can use that to determine her speed on the beach and then calculate the time spent on the sidewalk.  

Let's break it down:

* **Beach Speed:**  She covers 2 miles in 40 minutes, so her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.
* **Sidewalk Speed:**  She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, so her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.
* **Sidewalk Time:**  She walks 1 mile at 0.1 miles per minute, so it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to use a bit of logic and algebra.  

Let's break it down:

* **Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

* **The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:**  This means the blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.

* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:** So, the red rope is 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

* **The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters:**  We can write this as an equation: y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Now, let's solve for 'y':

1.  y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
2.  6y - 35 = 37
3.  6y = 72
4.  y = 12

Finally,  find the length of the red rope:

* Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters



**Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.**

"This is a fun word problem!  While I'm a health expert, I'm also good with numbers. Let's break it down:

* Rissa got three times as much as Ronnie, so she started with 3 * $5 = $15.
*  Let's say they each gave 'x' dollars to their sister.
* Rissa had $15 - x left, and that's 4/5 of her original amount.  We can write that as an equation: $15 - x = (4/5) * $15
* Simplifying the equation: $15 - x = $12
*  Subtracting $15 from both sides: -x = -3
*  Multiplying both sides by -1: x = $3

So, each of them gave $3 to their sister.  Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"To figure this out, we need to think about how many groups of students can fit into the escape room and how long each group will take.  

* There are 30 students total.
* Each group can have 8 students.
* That means we'll need 30 / 8 = 3.75 groups. 
* Since we can't have parts of groups, we'll need to round up to 4 groups.
* Each group has 45 minutes to escape.
* So, the total time will be 4 groups * 45 minutes/group = 180 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can use a bit of algebra.  

Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece of wood.  The longer piece is four times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4x.  

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 8

The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it is 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.

"This is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using a system of equations.  Let's break it down:

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens) using substitution or elimination.  

Let me demonstrate the substitution method:

1. Solve the first equation for 'w':
   w = 20 - c

2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. Simplify and solve for 'c':
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5
