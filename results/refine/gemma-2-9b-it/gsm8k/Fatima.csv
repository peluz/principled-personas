"Okay, let's break down this house flipping scenario. 

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value went up by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

* **Return trip:**
    * He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    * He drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    * He has 4 hours for the return trip - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (slow driving) = 1.5 hours left.
    * In the remaining time, he drives at 80 mph, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

* **Total return distance:** 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

* **Final distance from home:** John traveled 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, so he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, so that's x/3 + 2.

*  After the green and red houses, she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  Finally, she has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining: (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18



**Answer:** Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

*  That leaves 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.

*  Of those 16, 25% chose jazz, which is 4 students.

*  So, 12 students must have chosen hip-hop!

*  Finally, to find the percentage of the whole class who chose hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100%: (12/20) * 100% = 60%

If the book is selling for $19.50 after a 25% discount, that means $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).

To find the original price, we can set up a proportion:

75/100 = $19.50 / x

* Darrell's age is 7 parts
* Allen's age is 11 parts

Together, they make up 7 + 11 = 18 parts.

Each part represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.

"Let's figure this out!  

If Gretchen has 110 coins total and 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can use a little algebra.  

Let 's' represent the number of silver coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins, there are 's + 30' gold coins.  

We know the total number of coins is 110, so:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

g = s + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Let's break this down!  

Since each level is half the size of the one below it, we're dealing with a geometric sequence.  We know the top level is 16 square feet.  To find the total square footage, we need to add up the area of all four levels:

* Level 1: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 3: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet
* Level 4: 128 * 2 = 256 square feet

Total square footage: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 500 square feet

Average square footage: 500 / 4 = 125 square feet

*  And since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, there are '2 * 2q' or '4q' worker bees.

We know the total number of bees is 700, so:

q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combining like terms:

7q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7:

q = 100

Now we know there are 100 queen bees.  

To find the number of worker bees:

4q = 4 * 100 = 400

"Let's break this down.  We're dealing with exponential growth here since the price increases by a percentage of the *current* price each time.

The price starts at $20 and increases by 20% every two months.  This means the price is multiplied by 1.20 every two months.

To find the price after 36 months, we can use the formula:

*Final Price = Initial Price * (Growth Factor) ^ (Number of Periods)*

In this case:

* Initial Price = $20
* Growth Factor = 1.20
* Number of Periods = 36 months / 2 months/period = 18 periods

So, the final price is:

"Okay, let's break this down!

There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a standard six-sided die (4, 5, and 6).  That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number greater than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, think about it this way:

* The first roll has to be even, which has a 1/2 chance.
*  If the first roll is even, the second roll also has a 1/2 chance of being even.

So, to get two even numbers in a row, we multiply those probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Converting that to a percentage, we get (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

"To figure this out, we need to think about how averages work.  Brinley wants an average of 93 across six tests.  That means her total score across all six tests needs to be 93 * 6 = 558.

She's already scored 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 on the first five tests.  

So, she needs to score 558 - 438 = 120 on the sixth test.

"Let's break down Micheal's biking journey:

* **Phase 1:** He rode 25 kilometers per ride, 5 times a week for 4 weeks.  That's 25 km/ride * 5 rides/week = 125 km per week.  Over four weeks, he covered 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

* **Phase 2:**  He then rode 60 kilometers per ride, 2 times a week for 3 weeks.  That's 60 km/ride * 2 rides/week = 120 km per week.  Over three weeks, he covered 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

"Let's figure this out!  

We know each red chicken lays 3 eggs and each white chicken lays 5.  If Jerry collects 42 eggs total, we can set up an equation to represent that. Let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens.

* 3r + 5w = 42 

We also know Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens:

* w = r + 2

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'r'.  Let's plug the second equation into the first:

* 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

* 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
* 8r + 10 = 42
* 8r = 32
* r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to figure out the total distance and then divide that by his walking speed.  

The park is a rectangle, so we can find the perimeter (the total distance around the outside) by using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now we know the distance is 15 miles, and Gary walks at 3 miles per hour.  

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour

*  Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool has now.

* Since the pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, both pools lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes.

* Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool.  Let's say the small pool had 's + 16' gallons then. This means the big pool had 2 * (s + 16) gallons.

* Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.  So, 2 * (s + 16) - 16 = 4 * (s - 16)

* Simplifying the equation: 2s + 32 - 16 = 4s - 64
* Combining like terms: 16 = 2s - 64
* Adding 64 to both sides: 80 = 2s
* Dividing both sides by 2: s = 40

"Let's break this down:

* **Initial Investment:** Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so her initial investment is 8 * $8 = $64.

* **Year 1 Increase:** The stock price goes up 50%, meaning each share increases by $8 * 0.50 = $4.

* **Year 1 Value:** After the increase, each share is worth $8 + $4 = $12, and her total holding is worth 8 * $12 = $96.

* **Year 2 Decrease:** The price drops 25%, so each share decreases by $12 * 0.25 = $3.

* **Final Value:**  After the decrease, each share is worth $12 - $3 = $9, and her total holding is worth 8 * $9 = $72.

"Let's break this problem down.  

If we let 'x' represent the size of the two equal groups, we know:

* x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

* 3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

* 3x = 210

"Let's figure this out!  

* If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this: for every 1 cow, there are 2 chickens. 
*  Since there are 60 animals total, we need to find a way to split that 60 evenly between cows and chickens that follows that 1:2 ratio.

*  Let's say there are 'x' cows. That means there would be '2x' chickens.
*  Together, they make up 60 animals: x + 2x = 60
*  Combining like terms, we get 3x = 60
*  Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 20 cows.
*  So, there are 20 cows and 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

*  Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs.
*  That means the cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs, and the chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

*  Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Joanne's total (excluding average):**  Joanne picked 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

* **Sister's apples:** The sister picked 60 apples from the tallest trees and 45 apples from the shortest trees, for a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Joanne's average apples:** Since the sisters picked a total of 500 apples, Joanne must have picked 500 - 105 = 395 apples.  Subtracting her apples from the tallest and shortest trees, she picked 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Let's figure this out!  

If we have 180 heads in total and camels have two humps, we can think of it this way:

*  Let 'c' be the number of camels.
*  Let 'd' be the number of dromedaries.

We know:

*  c + d = 180  (One head per animal)
*  2c + d = 304 (Two humps for each camel)

To find the number of dromedaries (d), we can use a little algebra.  Let's solve for 'c' in the first equation:

c = 180 - d

Now, substitute that value of 'c' into the second equation:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

360 - 2d + d = 304
-d = -56
d = 56



**Answer:** There are 56 dromedaries.

* He gets half the number of cookies as carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra for cleaning his room.

So, if 'c' is the number of carrot sticks, we can write the equation:

(c/2) + 2 = 5

Now, let's solve for 'c':

1. Subtract 2 from both sides: (c/2) = 3
2. Multiply both sides by 2: c = 6


**Answer:** Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"That's a great question!  As a marine biologist, I can tell you that remoras are fascinating creatures.  

To figure out the percentage, we need to do a little calculation. First, let's convert everything to inches:

* The shark is 10 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so it's 10 * 12 = 120 inches long.
* Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are two of them, so their total length is 6 * 2 = 12 inches.

Now we can find the percentage:

(Remora length / Shark length) * 100% = (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100% = 10%

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects.

"To figure this out, we need to consider that weight loss is a complex process and depends on many factors beyond just calorie deficit.  

However,  a general guideline is that a safe and sustainable rate of weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week.  

So, for Andy to lose 30 pounds in 190 days, he'd need to aim for a deficit of roughly 1.5-3 pounds per week. 

To lose 1.5 pounds a week, he'd need to burn an extra 5250-7000 calories per week (1.5 lbs * 3500 calories/lb).  

That translates to a daily deficit of about 750-1000 calories.

A car tire's lifespan is often measured in rotations, not miles.  We know each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.  

Jeremy's car rotates its tires 725 times for every 2 miles driven.  That means in a month, with 400 miles driven, the tires rotate 400 miles * (725 rotations / 2 miles) = 145,000 rotations.

"To figure out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to find the difference in cost between the two streets. 

First, let's calculate the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

* Cost per meter: $194
* Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters
* Total cost for Lewis' street: $194 * 490 = $95,060

Next, we know Monica's street costs $29,100 to repave.

Finally, subtract Monica's street cost from Lewis' street cost:

* $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

* **Heartworm Check:**  Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can represent the total bill as 'x'.  So, 0.60x = heartworm check cost.

* **Total Bill:** $40 (vaccines) + 0.60x (heartworm check) = x (total bill)

* **Solving for x:**
    * Subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40
    * Subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40

"Let's calculate the total number of petals in the vase.

*  Rose starts with 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
*  Then she adds 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
*  Next, she adds 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
*  Finally, she adds 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

That's a total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals before any are lost.

She drops 1 of each type of flower, so she loses 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 petals.

Therefore, there are 101 - 4 = 97 petals left in the vase.

"Let's break this arcade problem down!

* **Jack's playtime:** Jack plays for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. Since he plays for 20 minutes per quarter, he uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

* **Weaker friends' playtime:** Each weaker friend plays for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They each play for 240 minutes, using 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters each.

* **Better friend's playtime:** The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, meaning they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They use 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

* **Total quarters:**  Adding up everyone's quarters, we get 12 + (24 * 2) + 8 = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

"Let's break this down.  Elaina's final concert was twice as long as her usual shows, plus a 15-minute encore.  We know the final concert was 65 minutes.  

If we let 'x' represent the length of her regular concerts, we can set up an equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To find out the length of her usual concerts, we need to solve for 'x'.

1. Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 50
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 25


Her usual concerts are **25** minutes long.

   Rest time is half the swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

* **Step 4: Remaining Distance**
   Remaining distance: 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

* **Step 5: Time for Second Swim**
   Speed for the second swim is half the original speed: 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour
   Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

* **Step 6: Total Time**
   Total time = 6 hours (swim) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (swim) = 17 hours

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

*  Since Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, Bahati scored 'x + 20' points.

*  Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Bahati, so Dinar scored 'x + 20 - 10' or 'x + 10' points.

*  The total points for the team is 45, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

*  Simplifying the equation: 3x + 30 = 45

*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

"Let's figure this out!  

* Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find out how many Pokemon Stan caught (S), we can use substitution:

1.  Since A = S + 5, we can substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
    (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3.  We also know S = 4W - 13.  Let's substitute that into the simplified equation:
    2S + (4W - 13) = 334

4.  Now we have an equation with just S and W. Let's solve for W:
    2S + 4W = 347
    4W = 347 - 2S
    W = (347 - 2S) / 4

5. Substitute this value of W back into the equation S = 4W - 13:
    S = 4 * ((347 - 2S) / 4) - 13

6. Simplify and solve for S:
    S = 347 - 2S - 13
    3S = 334
    S = 111.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, let's double-check our work. It seems there might be a slight error in the problem setup.

"Let's figure this out!  To make sure Pat has enough room for all her flowers, we need to figure out how many plants she can fit in her flower bed.  

First, we need to know how many inches long her flower bed is: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Then, we need to figure out how much space each plant needs.  Since each plant is 12 inches wide and Pat wants 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant, that means each plant needs 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches of space.

Now we can see how many plants will fit: 1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't have part of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 more plants.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the power bank ended up with 28% charge after losing a certain amount.  

*  It lost 9% for 5 hours, which is a total of 45% lost (9 * 5 = 45).
*  Then it lost another 7% for 3 hours, which is another 21% lost (7 * 3 = 21).

So, in total, the power bank lost 66% of its charge (45% + 21% = 66%).

To find the original charge, we can set up an equation:

Original charge - 66% = 28%

Let 'x' represent the original charge.  Solving for x:

x - 0.66x = 0.28
0.34x = 0.28
x = 0.28 / 0.34
x ≈ 0.82 or 82%

"Let's break this down.  

The price of the carrots goes up by 5% each year.  That means we need to calculate the increase each year and add it to the original price.

* **Year 1:**  A 5% increase on $120 is (0.05) * $120 = $6.  So the price is now $120 + $6 = $126.

* **Year 2:**  The increase is now on $126: (0.05) * $126 = $6.30. The price is now $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

* **Year 3:**  The increase is on $132.30: (0.05) * $132.30 = $6.615. The price is now $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of the carrots after three years would be $139.

* **Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, or $4 * 3 = $12.**

* **The earnings from large stuffed animals are x * $12 = $12x.**

* **Teresa's total earnings are $8x + $12x = $120.**

* **Combining like terms, we get $20x = $120.**

* **To find the number of large stuffed animals sold (x), divide both sides by $20: x = $120 / $20 = 6.**

"Let's break this down step-by-step:

* **Steel Pickaxe Output:**  A steel pickaxe boosts output by 50% compared to iron, meaning an extra 24 pounds * 0.50 = 12 pounds per day.  So, with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf mines 24 pounds + 12 pounds = 36 pounds per day.

* **Total Daily Output:**  With 40 dwarves using steel pickaxes, they mine a combined 40 dwarves * 36 pounds/dwarf = 1440 pounds per day.

* **Monthly Output:** Over a 30-day month, they'd mine 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43,200 pounds.

* **Scenario 2: Normal Teacher**
   * If the regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension.
   * This means there's a 60% chance she *won't* give an extension.

* **Scenario 3: Dog Ate My Homework**
   * Even if no one gets an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher.

To find the probability Marcus *has* to turn in his homework, we need to consider the opposite: the chances he *doesn't* have to.

* **Probability of NOT having to turn in homework:**
    *  50% (substitute) + (60% * 80%) (normal teacher + no extension) + (60% * 20%) (normal teacher + no extension + dog ate it) = 50% + 48% + 12% = 110%

* **Wait, 110%?**  That's impossible! This means there's some overlap in our calculations.  Let's rephrase:

* **Probability of NOT having to turn in homework:**
    * 50% (substitute) + (60% * 80%) (normal teacher + no extension) + (60% * 20%) (normal teacher + no extension + dog ate it) = 50% + 48% + 12% = 110%

* **Probability of having to turn in homework:**
    * 100% - 110% = -10%

* **Hold on!**  A negative probability doesn't make sense. This means there's an error in our logic.  Let's go back and carefully examine our assumptions.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  We know there are 84 total passengers.  

To find out how many women there are, we need to figure out what portion of the total passengers represent women.  

* The ratio 5:9 means there are 5+9 = 14 total parts.
* Each part represents 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.
* Since women represent 9 parts, there are 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus initially.

*  We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. 

Let's use variables to make it easier:

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break this problem down step by step.  

Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

Let's solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:
w = 5c + 35

"Let's break this down:

* **Jar Volume:** The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches by 15 inches, so its volume is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

* **Usable Volume:**  Since jelly beans aren't perfectly packed, we need to account for empty space.  With 80% efficiency, the usable volume is 540 * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

* **Maximum Jelly Beans:**  If each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, the jar could hold 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

* **Estimated Red Jelly Beans:**  Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, so he'd estimate 2880 * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

Then there are 15 four-legged animals, which is 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Adding those together, we have 20 + 60 = 80 legs in total.

Since each pair of legs has two legs, there are 80 / 2 = 40 pairs of legs on the farm.

"Let's break down the boat's depreciation:

* **Year 1:**  A 30% depreciation means the boat loses $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 in value.  That leaves it worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

* **Year 2:**  Another 30% depreciation on the reduced value: $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  So, it's now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

* **Year 3:**  Finally, a 20% depreciation: $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  The boat's worth after three years is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out how many holes the dog digs in total.  It digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so that's 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Then, Nate fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new ones each night.  This means Nate makes a net progress of 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled each day.

Finally, to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by his daily progress: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill all the holes.
