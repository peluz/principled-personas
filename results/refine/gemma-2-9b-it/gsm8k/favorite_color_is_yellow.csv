"Okay, let's break down this house flipping problem!

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the repairs increased it by 150%.  That means the value went up by 1.5 times its original price:

*  $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Next, we add up the cost of the house and the repairs:

* $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Finally, subtract the total investment from the new value to find the profit:

* $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

"Let's break this download problem down:

* **Step 1: Initial Download Time** 
   If Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, a 200 GB file would take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

* **Step 2: Download Progress at Restart**
   The restart happens 40% of the way through, so that's 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes.

* **Step 3: Data Downloaded Before Restart**
   In those 40 minutes, she downloads 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

* **Step 4: Remaining Download Time**
   She has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

* **Step 5: Total Download Time**
   The remaining download takes 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

* **Step 6: Final Calculation**
   Adding the initial download time, restart time, and remaining download time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **First leg:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    *  He spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    *  He then drives 30 miles per hour for half an hour (0.5 hours), covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    *  He has 4 hours for the return trip, but has already used 2.5 hours, leaving 1.5 hours.
    *  In the remaining time, he drives 80 miles per hour, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.
    *  The total distance covered on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

* **Final distance:**  Since he traveled 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.  This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.

Let's say their combined age is represented by the number 'y'. We can set up an equation:

7x + 11x = y

Since we know their total age is 162, we can substitute:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms:

18x = 162

Now, solve for x:

x = 162 / 18 
x = 9

Allen's current age is 11x, so:

Allen's current age = 11 * 9 = 99

Finally, to find Allen's age in 10 years, simply add 10:

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109

*  We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
*  We also know she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Think of it like this: if we let 's' stand for the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins would be 's + 30'.  

Since all her coins add up to 110, we can write the equation: s + (s + 30) = 110

Now, let's solve for 's':

"Buzz buzz!  This is a classic beehive problem!  

To figure out how many worker bees there are, we need to think about the relationships between the different types of bees.  

* We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
* And there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees.

Let's use a little bee math:

* If we let 'q' represent the number of queen bees, then there are 2q baby bees.
* Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

We also know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700. So:

q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combining like terms:

7q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7:

q = 100

Now we can find the number of worker bees:

w = 4q = 4 * 100 = 400

There are 3 numbers on a standard six-sided die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number bigger than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, think of it this way:

* The first roll has to be even (2, 4, or 6), which is a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance.
*  If you get an even number, the second roll also has to be even.  That's another 1/2 chance.

To get the probability of both things happening, we multiply: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

"Let's break down this programmer payroll problem:

First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are.  Since they make up 2/5 of the total employees,  that's (2/5) * 100 employees = 40 junior programmers.

Now, we know there are 100 employees total and 40 are junior programmers, so there must be 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers earn $2000 per month, so the total salary for all junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, meaning they earn $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.  

The total salary for all senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, to find the total payroll for all programmers, we add the salaries of the junior and senior programmers: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations:

*  Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries

* Equation 1: c + d = 180  (Total heads)
* Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (Total bumps)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'c':  c = 180 - d

2. Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

James is 10% faster than Jon in the swim, so he finished in 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes.  He also took 5 minutes longer on the bike, meaning his bike time was 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time was 170 minutes (Jon's time) + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

Finally, we can subtract his swim and bike times from his total time to find his run time: 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes.

* **Movie B:** Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it's 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

* **Movie A:** Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning it's 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

* **Distance:**  The horse runs 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes (0.5 hours), so it covers 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

* **Hay:** The horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile, so it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales.

* **Cost:** Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales cost 8 * $3 = $24.

* **Change:** Michael has $30 (6 * $5) and spends $24 on hay, leaving him with $30 - $24 = $6 in change.

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily was a real bug enthusiast and found 7 more than David.
*  David, well, he found half the number of insects Bodhi did.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of logic and some simple math.  Let's think about it step-by-step:

1. **Let's represent the number of insects each person found:**

   *  B = Bodhi's insects
   *  D = David's insects
   *  L = Lily's insects

2. **We can write down what we know as equations:**

   *  L + D + B = 43  (Total insects)
   *  L = D + 7       (Lily found 7 more than David)
   *  D = B / 2        (David found half of what Bodhi found)

3. **Now, let's use substitution to solve for L (Lily's insects):**

   * Since we know L = D + 7, we can substitute (D + 7) for L in the first equation:
      (D + 7) + D + B = 43

   *  Simplify: 2D + B + 7 = 43
   *  Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36

   *  We also know D = B / 2. Let's substitute that into the equation:
      2(B / 2) + B = 36

   *  Simplify: B + B = 36
   *  Combine like terms: 2B = 36

   *  Divide both sides by 2: B = 18  (Bodhi found 18 insects)

   *  Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 (David found 9 insects)

   *  Finally, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 (Lily found 16 insects)



**Answer:** Lily found 16 insects.

Now, to figure out his daily deficit, we'll divide that total by the number of days he has until his birthday: 105,000 calories / 190 days = 552.63 calories/day.

"Let's break this down!  If the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can think of it like this:

*  The lot is one part.
*  The house is three parts.

Together, they make up five parts, and those five parts equal $120,000.

To find the cost of one part (the lot), we divide the total cost by five: $120,000 / 5 = $24,000

Since the house is three parts, it costs three times the price of the lot: $24,000 * 3 = $72,000

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since April has 30 days, he needs to figure out how much to save each day to reach his goal.

He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as the first half.  Let's say he saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half. That means he'd save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

Here's the equation to represent that:

15x + 30(2x) = 1125

Simplifying:

15x + 60x = 1125

75x = 1125

x = 15

So, Elvis needs to save $15 each day in the first half.  

In the second half, he'll save twice that amount, or $15 * 2 = $30 per day.

3. **Combine and divide:**  We add 20 to half of 'x' (20 + x/2) and then divide the whole thing by 5.

4. **Multiply by the difference:** Finally, we multiply the result from step 3 by (20 - 12), which is 8.

5. **The final expression:** Putting it all together, the final value of the number train is: [(20 + x/2) / 5] * 8 



Let me know if you want to plug in a specific value for 'x' to get a numerical answer!

"Here's how to figure out the right oven temperature:

The oven is running 18 degrees hotter than it should be at 450 degrees.  That means it's off by 4%.  

To find the correct temperature for a recipe calling for 520 degrees, we need to figure out what temperature to set it at to get 520 degrees *after* the oven's 4% overshoot.

Let's call the temperature Maggie should set 'x'.  We know:

x + 0.04x = 520

Combining like terms:

1.04x = 520

Dividing both sides by 1.04:

x = 500

"Let's break this jelly bean problem down!  

First, we know there are 4500 jelly beans total.  Let's say 'b' represents the number of blue jelly beans.  

* Red jelly beans are 1% fewer than blue, so there are 0.99b red jelly beans.
* Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue, so there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

Now we can set up an equation:

0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b':

b = 4500 / 2.99 
b ≈ 1505 blue jelly beans

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

* Red: 0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490
* Green: 1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

Finally, the difference between green and red jelly beans is:

1520 - 1490 = 30

We know:

*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1

Combining like terms in the last equation, we get: 4b + y + s = 88

Now, substitute the first two equations into this: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Simplifying: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substitute 'y' from the first equation again: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

This becomes: 6b - 8 = 88

Solving for 'b': 6b = 96  =>  b = 16

* She uses 2 yards of material for every 4 small masks, so that's 0.5 yards per small mask.

* She uses 2.25 yards for every 3 large masks, so that's 0.75 yards per large mask.

Now let's calculate the total material:

* Small masks: 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards
* Large masks: 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards

Finally, add the material for both types: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

First, find the cost of the balloons: 1 dozen is 12 balloons, and they cost $0.50 for every 2 balloons. So, they bought 12 / 2 = 6 sets of 2 balloons.  That means the balloons cost 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

Next, calculate the total cost of the ice cream: 2 tubs at $7.00 each cost 2 * $7.00 = $14.00.

Now, add up the cost of everything: $11.00 (cake) + $3.00 (balloons) + $14.00 (ice cream) = $28.00.

"Let's solve this problem!  

* Let Peter's age be ""P""
* Let Paul's age be ""Pa""
* Let John's age be ""J""

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100 
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Let's use substitution to find Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4.  Substitute J = 20 back into P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10

"Let's break down this widget-making problem!

First, we need to figure out how many widgets each machine produces in a month.  The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in a 24-hour day, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Over 30 days, that's 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in a day it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.  Over 30 days, that's 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 would earn 43,200 * $6 = $259,200.

The WidgetMaster 9000 would earn 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

"Let's solve this Pokemon problem!  

*  Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
*  Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find out how many Pokemon Stan caught (S), we can use substitution:

1.  Since A = S + 5, we can substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
    S + 5 + S + W = 339

2.  Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3.  We also know S = 4W - 13.  Let's substitute that into the simplified equation:
    2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

4.  Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
    8S + S + 13 = 1336

5.  Combine like terms:
    9S + 13 = 1336

6.  Subtract 13 from both sides:
    9S = 1323

7.  Divide both sides by 9:
    S = 147



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

She also needs 1.5 feet of space between each plant, which is 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.  So, the total space needed is 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

That means she needs 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't buy half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

3 pages * x minutes = 18 pages * 10 minutes

Simplifying:

3x = 180

"Let's break this problem down!

*  If a small stuffed animal costs $4, and Teresa sells twice as many small ones as large ones, we can figure out how much she made from the small animals. 
*  Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.
*  Earnings from small stuffed animals: 2x * $4 = $8x
*  Earnings from large stuffed animals: x * $12 = $12x
*  Her total earnings are $120, so: $8x + $12x = $120
*  Combining like terms: $20x = $120
*  Solving for x: x = $120 / $20 = 6
*  Since she sold twice as many small as large, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Let's break this down step-by-step.  

* **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher** 
   There's a 50% chance Marcus has a substitute, who might not collect homework. That means there's a 50% chance he *doesn't* have to turn it in.

* **Scenario 2: Regular Teacher**
   If the regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension. That means there's a 60% chance she *won't* give an extension.

* **Scenario 3: Dog Ate My Homework**
   Even if no one gets an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher his dog ate it.

To figure out the overall chance Marcus *has* to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the ways he *doesn't* get out of it:

1.  Regular teacher, no extension, and no dog excuse: 60% * 80% = 48%

2.  Regular teacher, no extension, and dog excuse: 60% * 20% = 12%

3.  Substitute teacher, homework collected: 50% * 100% = 50%

Now, add those probabilities together: 48% + 12% + 50% = 110%

Wait a minute! That's more than 100%!  That means we've double-counted some scenarios.  Let's adjust:

1.  Regular teacher, no extension, and no dog excuse: 48%

2.  Substitute teacher, homework collected: 50%

Add those together: 48% + 50% = 98%

Finally, subtract that from 100% to find the probability Marcus *doesn't* have to turn in his homework:

100% - 98% = 2%

"Here's how to figure out the discount:

* **Find the sale price:**  The watch was on sale for 75% of $2000, which is (0.75) * $2000 = $1500.

* **Calculate the profit:** Mr. Rogers made a profit of $1800 - $1500 = $300 when he sold the watch.

* **Find the discount percentage:** The discount is the difference between the original price and the selling price, divided by the original price: ($2000 - $1800) / $2000 = 0.10 or 10%.

"Let's break this fence problem down!

*  Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence total.
*  Harry wants 60 feet *more* than Sam.

Think of it like this: if Sam gets 'x' feet, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.  

Together, that's x + (x + 60) = 100 feet.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we have 2x = 40.

Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

* **Total daily class time:**  He spends 6 periods * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes in his regular classes, plus his 80 extra minutes, for a total of 320 minutes per day.
* **Total weekly class time:** Over 5 days, that's 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes.
* **Extra learning time:** He spends 1/16 of his total weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday, which is 1600 minutes * (1/16) = 100 minutes each day.

*  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so if Sarah painted 'y' eggs, Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.

*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30.  Simplifying that, we get 2y + 12 = 30.

*  Subtracting 12 from both sides, we have 2y = 18.

*  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that y = 9. So Sarah painted 9 eggs.

*  Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

*  We also know that 2x (Arnold and Madeline's eggs) + 30 (Camden and Sarah's eggs) = 56 total eggs.

*  Substituting what we know, we get 2x + 30 = 56.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.  

First, we know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and takes 40 minutes to do so.  To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula:

*Speed = Distance / Time*

So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at this faster speed.  To find the time it takes, we use the same formula:

*Time = Distance / Speed*

So, it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes to walk the sidewalk.

"Let's break this down step by step.  

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  We know there are 84 total passengers.  

To find out how many women there are, we need to figure out what portion of the total passengers represent women.  

* The ratio 5:9 means there are 5 + 9 = 14 total parts.
* Each part represents 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.
* Since women represent 9 parts, there are 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus initially.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left on the bus.

"As a big fan of yellow, I'm always happy to solve a problem involving rope lengths!  

Let's break this down:

*  We know the yellow rope is 'y' centimeters long.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making it 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Together, their lengths add up to 37 centimeters:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Now, let's solve for 'y':

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
* 6y - 35 = 37
* 6y = 72
* y = 12

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

* Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Rissa received three times the amount Ronnie did, so she started with 3 * $5 = $15.

Since they both gave the same amount to their sister, let's call that amount 'x'.  Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount, which means:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides:

-x = -3

Finally, multiplying both sides by -1:

x = $3

This means each of them gave $3 to their sister.  

Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.  

Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

* **Statement 1:** Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7)

* **Statement 2:** In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.  We can write this as: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1.  Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:
    w = 5c + 35

2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
    c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

"Let's break this down step-by-step:

* **Low setting:** The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
* **Medium setting:**  Twice the amount of the low setting means it removes 1 liter * 2 = 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:**  Twice the amount of the medium setting means it removes 2 liters * 2 = 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total water removed for each setting:

* **Low setting:** 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

To make a gallon of lemonade, you need 1 cup of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice, Tim will need 6 lemons per gallon.

For 4 gallons, that's 6 lemons/gallon * 4 gallons = 24 lemons.

Allen wants a super tart gallon, twice as tart as the others, so Tim needs to double the lemons for that one: 6 lemons/gallon * 2 = 12 lemons.

In total, Tim needs 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.

"Let's break down this boat depreciation problem:

* **Year 1:**  A 30% depreciation means the boat loses 0.30 * $9000 = $2700 in value.  That leaves it worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

* **Year 2:**  Another 30% depreciation on the new value: 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.  So, it's now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

* **Year 3:**  Finally, a 20% depreciation: 0.20 * $4410 = $882.  The boat's worth after three years is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to find the total length of the fence.  That's called the perimeter!

Think of it like this:  If you were to walk all the way around the fence, the total distance you'd cover is the perimeter.

For a rectangle, we can find the perimeter by adding up the lengths of all four sides:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.  So:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 35 feet = 70 feet

"Well, this is a classic farm animal puzzle!  To figure out how many chickens Farmer Brown has, we need to use a little bit of math. 

Let's say 'c' is the number of chickens and 'w' is the number of cows.  We know:

*  c + w = 20  (There are 20 animals total)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4, and there are 70 legs total)

We can solve for 'c' using a bit of algebra.  Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for 'w':

w = 20 - c

Now, substitute that value of 'w' into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5
