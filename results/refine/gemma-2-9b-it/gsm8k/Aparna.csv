"Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal. 

Here's how I figured that out:

* Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
* With 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed total.
* She's already given out 40 cups (15 cups + 25 cups).
*  So, she needs 60 - 40 = 20 cups for the last meal.

"Let's break this down:

Kylar is buying glasses in a pattern: $5, then $3, then $5, then $3, and so on.  

* He's essentially buying pairs of glasses, with one glass at full price and the next at a discount.

* Since he wants 16 glasses, that's 8 pairs.

* Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

* **Step 1: Initial Download Time** 
   Carla would normally download the entire 200 GB file at 2 GB/minute, taking 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

* **Step 2: Download Progress at Restart**
   The restart happens 40% of the way through, so she's downloaded 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes worth of data.

* **Step 3: Data Downloaded**
   At 40 minutes, she's downloaded 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

* **Step 4: Remaining Download**
   She has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

* **Step 5: Total Download Time**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **First leg:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    * He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    * He then drives 30 miles per hour for half an hour (0.5 hours), covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    * He has 4 hours for the return trip, but has already used 2.5 hours, leaving 1.5 hours.
    * In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.
    * The total distance covered on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

* **Final distance:**  Since he's traveling back towards home, we subtract the return trip distance from the initial trip distance: 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.



**Answer:** John is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18



**Answer:** Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

*  That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.

*  Next, we see how many of those students chose jazz: 16 students * 25% = 4 students.

*  Finally, the rest must have chosen hip-hop: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students.

*  To find the percentage of the whole class who chose hip-hop, we divide: (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%

The sale price is 75% of the original price because a 25% discount means the book is selling for 100% - 25% = 75% of its original cost.

To find the original price, we can set up a simple equation:

a = 9

Now that we know 'a', we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's age = 11a = 11 * 9 = 99

"Let's figure this out!  

If Gretchen has 110 coins total and 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation. Let 's' represent the number of silver coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins, we know there are 's + 30' gold coins.  

Together, they equal 110:  s + (s + 30) = 110

Here's how to find the average:

1. **Calculate the total square footage:**  We know the top level is 16 square feet.  Working our way down, each level doubles in size: 16 * 2 = 32, 32 * 2 = 64, and 64 * 2 = 128.  Adding these up, we get 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

2. **Divide by the number of levels:** To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 240 square feet / 4 levels = 60 square feet per level.

*  After that, she'll need 2 cups per day for the rest of the puppy's life.  

To figure out the total food needed in the first year, we need to calculate how many cups she'll use in the remaining days of the year: 365 days - 180 days = 185 days.

*  That means she'll use 185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups in the remaining days.

*  Adding those together, she'll need 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups in the first year.

"Let's break down this beehive problem!

* We know there are 700 bees in total.
*  There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.

To make things easier, let's use some variables:

*  Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
*  Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

Now we can set up some equations:

*  b = 2q  (Twice as many babies as queens)
*  w = 2b  (Twice as many worker bees as babies)
*  q + b + w = 700 (Total number of bees)

Let's solve for 'w' (the number of worker bees):

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation: q + 2q + 2(2q) = 700
2. **Simplify:** q + 2q + 4q = 700
3. **Combine** like terms: 7q = 700
4. **Divide** both sides by 7: q = 100
5. **Find the number of baby bees:** b = 2q = 2 * 100 = 200
6. **Find the number of worker bees:** w = 2b = 2 * 200 = 400



**Answer:** There are 400 worker bees.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Start with Dave:** Dave ate 14 fries.
* **Seagull's snack:** The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* **Fries remaining:**  After the seagull, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.
* **Pigeon party:**  Each pigeon ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* **Fries after pigeons:**  This is where things get tricky!  Since the pigeons ate 9 fries and there were only 7 left, this means there weren't enough fries for all the pigeons.  

Because the problem states that the pigeons bullied the seagull away, we can assume they ate all the remaining fries.

* **Raccoon's leftovers:** The raccoon didn't eat any fries because there weren't any left.
* **Ants' treat:** The ants took the last fry, leaving 5 behind.

**Working Backwards:**

* **Before the ants:** There were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
* **Before the pigeons:** There were 6 + 9 = 15 fries.
* **Before the seagull:** There were 15 + 7 = 22 fries.

"Let's break this down.  We're dealing with exponential growth here since the price increases by a percentage of the *current* price each time.

The price starts at $20 and increases by 20% every two months.  This means the price is multiplied by 1.20 every two months.

To find the price after 36 months, we can use the following formula:

*Final Price = Initial Price * (Growth Factor)^(Number of Periods)*

In this case:

* Initial Price = $20
* Growth Factor = 1.20
* Number of Periods = 36 months / 2 months/period = 18 periods

Plugging these values into the formula:

*Final Price = $20 * (1.20)^18 = $20 * 10.062656 = $201.25 (approximately)*

"Let's break this down.  

There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a standard six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number greater than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider each roll separately. There are 3 even numbers on the die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling one even number is 3/6, or 1/2.  Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Converting that to a percentage, we get (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

"Let's figure this out!  We can use a little algebra to solve this chicken conundrum.

Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens and 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

We know:

*  Each red chicken lays 3 eggs, and each white chicken lays 5 eggs.
*  Together, they lay 42 eggs each day.
*  There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can write this as a system of equations:

*  Equation 1: 3r + 5w = 42 
*  Equation 2: w = r + 2

To solve for 'r', we can substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

"To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to figure out the total distance and then divide that by his walking speed.  

The park is a rectangle, so we can find the perimeter (the total distance around the outside) by using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now we know the distance is 15 miles, and Gary walks at 3 miles per hour.  

Time = Distance / Speed

**Job A:**

* Gross pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
* Taxes: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000

* **Sister's Tallest Trees:**  Joanne's sister gathered twice the amount from the tallest trees, meaning she picked 30 * 2 = 60 apples.

* **Sister's Shortest Trees:** The sister picked three times the amount from the shortest trees compared to Joanne, so she picked 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

* **Sister's Total:**  In total, the sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Joanne's Total (Excluding Average):** Joanne picked 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of camels
*  Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries

* Equation 1: c + d = 180 (total heads)
* Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (total bumps)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'c':  c = 180 - d

2. Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

* Sugar cubes: 2 pounds
* Carrots: 48 pounds
* Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

Now, divide the total weight by the truck's carrying capacity:

4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

* **Equal Groups:** Since the kids were divided into equal groups of girls and boys, there were 10 girls and 10 boys.
* **Boys' Shells:** The boys collected 60 shells each, so they brought back a total of 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.
* **Girls' Shells:** The girls collected an amount equal to the boys' shells plus four times the boys' amount.  That means they collected 600 shells + (4 * 600 shells) = 3000 shells.
* **Shells per Girl:** To find out how many shells each girl brought back, we divide the total number of girls' shells by the number of girls: 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells/girl.



**Answer:** Each girl brought back 300 shells.

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since he wants to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month compared to the first half, we can set up an equation to represent this.

Let 'x' be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.  

* Savings in the first half: 15x 
* Savings in the second half: 30 * (2x) = 60x
* Total savings: 15x + 60x = $1125

Combining like terms:

75x = $1125

Now, solve for x:

x = $1125 / 75 
x = $15

So, Elvis saves $15 each day in the first half of April.  

To find his daily savings in the second half, we multiply that by 2:

$15 * 2 = $30

* The second angle is 2x
* The third angle is 3x

Now we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6: x = 30

The largest angle is 3 times the smallest, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

Now, substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 2:

4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Simplify and solve for 's':

4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Let 't' represent the age of one triplet.  Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the twin's age can be represented as 't + 7'.

The total age of all five children is 44, so we can write the equation: t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

Simplifying the equation: 5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5t = 30

Now that we know one triplet is 6 years old, we can find the age of one twin:

t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

* **Weaker friends' playtime:** Each weaker friend plays for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They each play for 240 minutes, using 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters each.

* **Better friend's playtime:** The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, meaning they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They use 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

We know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2

Now, substitute 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Let Peter's age be represented by 'P', Paul's age by 'Pa', and John's age by 'J'.

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute both the second and modified third equations into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying the equation:

4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Finally, substitute the value of J back into the equation P = 2J + 10:

P = (2 * 20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50


**Peter's age is 50.**

"Fern's looking at two great widget-making machines!  To figure out which one is more profitable, we need to compare their earnings.

* **Widgeteer 3000:** Makes 60 widgets per hour at $6 each, so that's 60 * $6 = $360 per hour.  Over 24 hours, it makes $360 * 24 = $8640 per day.

* **WidgetMaster 9000:** Makes 45 widgets per hour at $6 each, so that's 45 * $6 = $270 per hour. Over 24 hours, it makes $270 * 24 = $6480 per day.

Now, let's see how much they each make in a month with 30 days:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** $8640/day * 30 days = $259,200
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** $6480/day * 30 days = $194,400

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims.** 
   He swims 60% of 20 miles, which is 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

* **Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to swim the first leg.**
   Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

* **Step 3: Calculate the resting time.**
   He rests for half the swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* **Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance.**
   He has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to swim.

* **Step 5: Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance.**
   He swims at half his usual speed, so 1 mile per hour.  Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

* **Step 6: Calculate the total time.**
   Total time = 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Tobias's howl:** Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls twice as long as Tobias, so he howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* **Combined howl of Tobias and Chikote:** Together, they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for the same length of time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** All three wolves howl for a total of 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Total howl time in minutes:** There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is equal to 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's break this down!  

If each adult gets a slice twice as big as a kid's slice, we can think of it this way:

*  Let 'k' represent the size of one kid's slice.
*  Each adult gets 2k.

Since the watermelon is divided into 6 equal slices, we have:

4k + 2 * 2k = 6

Simplifying the equation:

4k + 4k = 6
8k = 6
k = 6/8 = 0.75

So, each adult gets 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

To find the percentage, we divide the adult's share by the total slices and multiply by 100%:

(1.5 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 25%

"Let's break this down.  We know the starting population is 50 porcupines, and 3/5 of them are female. That means there are 30 female porcupines.

Since each female gives birth to 4 babies per month, in a year (12 months) they'll have 4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies each.

With 30 females, that's a total of 30 females * 48 babies/female = 1440 babies born in a year.

Adding the babies to the original population, we have 50 + 1440 = 1490 porcupines.

"To figure out the cost, we need to know how many gallons of water the pool holds.  

First, let's calculate the pool's volume:

Volume = width x length x depth
Volume = 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Now, we know the pool company uses 5.9 gallons per cubic foot to fill pools. So:

Gallons = Volume x 5.9
Gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Finally, the cost is $0.10 per gallon:

Cost = Gallons x $0.10 per gallon
Cost = 8260 gallons x $0.10
Cost = $826.00

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

* **Statement 1:**  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""  This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

* **Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""  This gives us: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   3c + 75 = 5c + 35
   40 = 2c
   c = 20



Colin is currently 20 years old.

* **Day 3 bandages used:** They used half a pack of 50 bandages, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
* **Total bandages used in 3 days:**  Adding up the bandages used each day, we get 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.
* **Total bandages before day 3:**  Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of day 3, they must have had 91 + 78 = 169 bandages before day 3.
* **Bandages from bulk packs on day 3:** They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, for a total of 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
* **Bandages at the start of day 3:**  Before the new bulk packs arrived, they had 169 - 100 = 69 bandages.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Find the number of red hats.**  Half of the 100 hats are red, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

* **Step 2: Find the number of hats that aren't red.**  Subtract the red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

* **Step 3: Find the number of blue hats.** 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

* **Step 4: Find the number of white hats.** Subtract the blue hats from the non-red hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

* Let 's' represent the number of strawberry ice cubes.
*  The number of blueberry ice cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write that as 5s - 4.
*  The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Now we can solve for 's':

* Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116
* Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120
* Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

Finally, substitute the value of 's' back into the expression for blueberry cubes:

* Blueberry cubes = 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

* **Aaron's Speed:**  We know Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Speed:** Vanessa runs half as fast as Aaron, meaning her speed is 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Time:** To find Vanessa's time, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.  She ran 4 miles at a speed of 0.0625 miles per minute, so her time is 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

"Let's break down Tom's restaurant earnings:

* **Cost per reservation:** 2 meals * $5/meal + $5 wine = $15
* **Earnings per night:** 6 reservations * $15/reservation = $90
* **Earnings per week:** $90/night * 2 nights/week = $180

"Let's break this down.  

The vendor made a 25% profit on his investment of $80.  That means his profit was $20 (25% of $80).  

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we add the profit to the original cost and then divide by the number of watermelons:

($80 + $20) / 50 = $100 / 50 = $2 per watermelon.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

*  Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
*  James is twice Dora's age, making him 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
*  John had James when he was 19, so he is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.
*  John's youngest son was born when he was 32, meaning the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
*  In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

* **Ana's Peeling Rate:** Ana peels one orange every 3 minutes.
* **Jane's Peeling Rate:** Jane peels one orange every 4 minutes.

* **Oranges Peeled in an Hour:**
    * Ana peels 60 minutes / 3 minutes/orange = 20 oranges.
    * Jane peels 60 minutes / 4 minutes/orange = 15 oranges.

* **The Difference:** Ana peels 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"This is a classic problem that demonstrates the power of setting up a system of equations!  

Let's say:

*  *c* = the number of chickens
*  *w* = the number of cows

We know:

*  *c + w = 20*  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  *2c + 4w = 70* (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can solve for *c* using substitution.  From the first equation, we know *w = 20 - c*.  Substituting this into the second equation gives us:

*2c + 4(20 - c) = 70*

Simplifying:

*2c + 80 - 4c = 70*
*-2c = -10*
*c = 5*
