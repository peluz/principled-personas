"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the renovations and subtract his total investment. 

The house's value increased by 150%, which is equivalent to a 1.5 multiplier.  Therefore, the increase in value is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.

The house's new value is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

His total investment is the purchase price plus the renovation costs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the difference between the final value and his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Trip:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**

   *  **Traffic Delay:** He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles.
   *  **Slow Driving:** He then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
   *  **High-Speed Driving:**  The remaining time for his return trip is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.  He drives at 80 mph during this time, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance:**  His total distance traveled on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Net Distance from Home:** Since he traveled 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, his net distance from home is 180 - 135 = 45 miles.

"To determine the break-even point for Carlos' lemon tree, we need to calculate the number of years it will take for the cumulative revenue from lemon sales to exceed the initial planting cost. 

Let:

*  *R* = Annual revenue from lemon sales
*  *C* = Annual cost of maintenance

We know:

* *R* = 7 lemons * $1.50/lemon = $10.50
* *C* = $3.00
* Initial cost = $90.00

Therefore, the net annual profit is:

* *P* = *R* - *C* = $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50

The break-even point is reached when:

* Cumulative profit = Initial cost

*  *n* * *P* = Initial cost

Where *n* is the number of years.

"Marcy's pension calculation involves a combination of a base amount and a percentage increase.  

* **Base Pension:** $50,000 per year
* **Increase Percentage:** 5%
* **Years of Service:** 30 years

Since the pension increase begins after 20 years, Marcy receives the base pension for the first 20 years and the increased pension for the remaining 10 years.

"To determine the average square footage of each level, we can utilize the concept of a geometric series.  

The square footage of each level forms a geometric sequence where the first term is 16 and the common ratio is 1/2 (since each level has half the area of the one below it).

The sum of a finite geometric series is given by:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:

* S is the sum of the series
* a is the first term
* r is the common ratio
* n is the number of terms

In this case:

* a = 16
* r = 1/2
* n = 4

Therefore, the total square footage of the sandcastle is:

S = 16 (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2) = 16 (1 - 1/16) / (1/2) = 16 (15/16) * 2 = 30 square feet.

Finally, the average square footage per level is:

30 square feet / 4 levels = 7.5 square feet per level.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Julia began with an unknown number of spoons (let's call this 'x').
* She bought a new package, increasing her total to x + y, where 'y' represents the number of spoons in the package she bought.
* Her husband added 5 more spoons, bringing the total to x + y + 5.
* She used 3 spoons, leaving her with x + y + 5 - 3 = x + y + 2 spoons.
* We know this final amount is 12 spoons: x + y + 2 = 12

Since we only know the final number of spoons and the number her husband added, we can solve for 'y':

y = 12 - x - 2 
y = 10 - x

Without knowing the initial number of spoons (x), we can't determine the exact number in the package Julia bought.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step to determine the initial number of french fries in the pack.

* **Seagull's Consumption:** The seagull consumed half the amount Dave ate, which was 14 fries / 2 = 7 fries.

* **Pigeon's Impact:**  The pigeons consumed 3 fries each, totaling 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

* **Fries After Pigeons:**  This results in 7 - 9 = -2 fries.  This indicates that the pigeons ate more fries than were available.

* **Raccoon and Ant Consumption:**  Since there were no fries remaining after the pigeons, the raccoon and ants did not consume any.

* **Working Backwards:**  To determine the initial number of fries, we need to reverse the process.  Since 5 fries remained before the ants took one, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.  Before the pigeons consumed any, there were 6 + 9 = 15 fries.  Finally, before the seagull ate its share, there were 15 + 7 = 22 fries.



**Therefore, there were 22 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.**

"To determine the number of red roses Fred must deliver, we need to analyze the given information:

*  Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
*  She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'w'.  We can set up the following equations:

*  Red roses = 4w
*  Pink calla lilies = 5w = 200

Solving for 'w', we get:

*  w = 200 / 5 = 40 white carnations

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a logical approach:

* Let J represent Jan's age, M represent Mark's age, and  represent Jean's age.

* We know J = 30.

* We are told ""Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.""  This translates to the equation: M - 2 = 0.5J - 5

* Substitute the known value of J: M - 2 = 0.5(30) - 5

* Simplify and solve for M: M - 2 = 15 - 5 => M - 2 = 10 => M = 12

* Finally, we know Jean is two years older than Mark:  J = M + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14



**Answer:** Jean is 14 years old.

"The difference in finishing times can be determined by calculating the total time for each team.

Team 1's time is straightforward: 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

For Team 2, we need to account for the progressive improvement in each runner's time:

* Runner 1: 60 seconds
* Runner 2: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
* Runner 3: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
* Runner 4: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Team 2's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Therefore, Team 1 wins by 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

"Let's break down this probability problem.

* **Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3**

There are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of a total of six possible outcomes.  Therefore, the probability of this event is 3/6 = 1/2.

* **Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row**

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.  Given that an even number was rolled on the first attempt, the probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

* **Difference in Probability**

The difference in probability between the two events is (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4.

* **Percentage Difference**

Finally, we convert the probability difference to a percentage: (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

"Ram's strategy can be modeled as a linear transformation.  

Let 'x' represent the number of full pens he starts with.  He then uses 5 empty pens to create 1 full pen, effectively reducing the number of empty pens by 5 and increasing the number of full pens by 1.  

This can be represented as:

x + (25 pens / 5 pens per full pen) = total pens

Simplifying the equation:

x + 5 = total pens

Since he begins with 25 pens, we have:

25 + 5 = 30 pens

"The weight of a redwood tree is primarily determined by its volume and density.  Assuming a consistent density for the redwood, we can calculate the weight as follows:

1. **Volume:** The volume of a cylinder (a reasonable approximation for a redwood trunk) is calculated as πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.  We'll need to make an assumption about the radius of the redwood trunk. Let's assume a radius of 3 feet for this example.

2. **Volume Calculation:**  Volume = π * (3 ft)² * 200 ft = 5654.87 cubic feet

3. **Weight Calculation:**  We need the density of redwood.  This can vary, but a typical value is around 35 pounds per cubic foot.

4. **Total Weight:** 5654.87 cubic feet * 35 pounds/cubic foot = 197,920.45 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Jim's points:** Jim has 3 fewer points than Mike, who has 21. Therefore, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

* **Tony's points:** Tony has double Mike's points, meaning he has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

* **Round 4 adjustments:**  Mike and Tony both exceed 20 points, so they each gain an additional point. This brings Mike's total to 21 + 1 = 22 points and Tony's to 42 + 1 = 43 points.

* **Total points:**  Summing the points of all three players, we get 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"Let's break down Elise's book sales to determine her earnings in the second year.

* **Total Books Sold:** Elise started with 250 books and has 50 unsold, meaning she's sold 250 - 50 = 200 books.

* **Books Sold in First Two Years:** She sold twice as many in the first year as the current year, so let 'x' represent the number of books sold this year.  The first year's sales were 2x.  Therefore, x + 2x = 200,  which means x = 66.67. Since we can't sell fractions of books, we'll round this to 65 books sold this year.

* **Earnings in the Second Year:**  Elise sells each book for $20, so her earnings in the second year were 65 books * $20/book = $1300.

"The problem describes a scenario involving conditional probabilities.  We are given:

*  P(Explode) = 0.01 (1% of candles explode)
*  P(Wet Dog | Explode) = 0.05 (5% of exploding candles smell like wet dog)

We want to find P(Explode and Wet Dog), the probability a candle both explodes and smells like wet dog.  We can use the formula for conditional probability:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

Rearranging to solve for P(A and B):

P(A and B) = P(A|B) * P(B)

Applying this to our problem:

P(Explode and Wet Dog) = P(Wet Dog | Explode) * P(Explode) 
                          = 0.05 * 0.01

"This problem can be solved using a system of equations.  

Let:

*  *c* represent the number of camels
*  *d* represent the number of dromedaries

We are given the following information:

*  *c + d = 180*  (The total number of heads)
*  *2c + d = 304* (The total number of humps)

We can solve for *d* (the number of dromedaries) using elimination.  Subtract the first equation from the second:

*(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180*

This simplifies to:

*c = 124*

Substitute this value of *c* back into either of the original equations to solve for *d*.  Using the first equation:

*124 + d = 180*

*d = 56*

"To determine the total number of shoes Frank has on Sunday, we can break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Inventory:** Frank begins with 200 shoes.

2. **Monday's Acquisition:** He gains 5 pairs of shoes, which equates to 5 * 2 = 10 additional shoes. His total becomes 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

3. **Wednesday's Acquisition:**  He acquires another 15 pairs, adding 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. His total is now 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

4. **Friday's Acquisition:**  He receives 30 more pairs, adding 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. His total is 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

5. **Saturday's Reduction:** He gets rid of 180 shoes, leaving him with 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let Jame's current age be represented by the variable 'j' and his cousin's current age by 'c'.

We are given the following information:

*  j + 5 = 27  (Jame will be 27 in 5 years)
*  c + 8 = 2j - 5 (In 8 years, the cousin's age will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age)

From the first equation, we can solve for j:

j = 27 - 5 = 22

Now, substitute this value of j into the second equation:

c + 8 = 2(22) - 5
c + 8 = 44 - 5
c + 8 = 39
c = 39 - 8
c = 31

Therefore, the age difference between Jame and his cousin is:

31 - 22 = 9 years.

"To determine Elvis's required daily savings in the second half of April, we can set up a simple algebraic equation. 

Let 'x' represent Elvis's daily savings in the first half of the month.  Since he aims to save twice as much each day in the second half, his daily savings in the second half would be 2x.

Given his monthly target of $1125, we can express this relationship as:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Simplifying the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125
x = 25

Therefore, Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of April.  His daily savings in the second half are 2 * $25 = $50.

"The beanstalk's height follows an exponential growth pattern.  We can express this mathematically as:

Height(t) = Initial Height * 2^(t-1)

Where 't' is the number of days.

To find out when the height exceeds 20 feet, we can set up the inequality:

20 < 4 * 2^(t-1)

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to model the funding growth.  

Let's break it down:

* **Initial Funding:** $100,000 for the first 5 months.
* **Funding Escalation:** A 50% increase each month after the initial 5 months.

This represents a geometric progression.  The total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = (Initial Funding * (1 + Growth Rate)^Number of Months) - Initial Funding

Applying this to John's case:

Total Cost = ($100,000 * (1 + 0.50)^(50 - 5)) - $100,000

Total Cost = ($100,000 * (1.50)^45) - $100,000

"Here's the solution:

Let's denote:

*  G = Ginger's initial candy amount
*  A = Amy's initial candy amount
*  g = Ginger's daily candy consumption
*  a = Amy's daily candy consumption
*  t = time in days

We are given:

* G = A = 100
* g = 4
* a = 3
* t = 14

The amount of candy remaining for each person after 't' days can be calculated as:

* Ginger's remaining candy: G - g*t = 100 - 4*14 = 100 - 56 = 44
* Amy's remaining candy: A - a*t = 100 - 3*14 = 100 - 42 = 58

The difference in candy between Amy and Ginger after two weeks is:

* 58 - 44 = 14

We are given:

*  Probability of receiving an interview (P(Interview)) = 0.30
*  Probability of receiving a job offer given an interview (P(Offer | Interview)) = 0.20
*  Probability of accepting the offer given a job offer (P(Accept | Offer)) = 1/3 = 0.3333

* **Step 2: Apply the probabilities sequentially.**

To find the probability of someone accepting a position, we multiply the probabilities at each stage:

P(Accept) = P(Interview) * P(Offer | Interview) * P(Accept | Offer)

P(Accept) = 0.30 * 0.20 * 0.3333 = 0.020

"To determine the average time it takes for the cat and dog to eat the sausages, we can use the following formula:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2

First, we need to calculate the dog's eating time.  We know the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now we can plug the values into the average time formula:

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2 = 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

* Let 'e' represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
* Ava jumps on 'e + 8' enemies.
* Let 'b' represent the number of berries Emma collects.
* Ava collects 'b + 3' berries.

We're given that Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, so let's assume Emma finishes with a time 't' seconds. Ava's time would then be 't + 4' seconds.

Now, we can express their scores:

* **Emma's score:** 10e + 5b + 30t
* **Ava's score:** 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t + 4)

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

We can represent the quantities used in the salt scrub with variables:

* Let  'z' represent the ounces of citrus zest.
* Since the fragrance amount is equal to the zest, we also have 'z' ounces of fragrance.
*  The salt and sugar amounts are equal, so we'll represent them as 's' ounces each.

We know the total weight of the scrub in the jar is 10 ounces.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Simplifying the equation:

2z + 4s = 10

We are given that the zest and fragrance amounts are equal, so we can substitute 'z' for 'z' in the equation:

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of cards PJ has.
*  *y* represent the number of cards Smendrick has.
*  *z* represent the number of cards Becca has.

We are given the following information:

*  *x + y + z = 341*  (The total number of cards)
*  *y = 3x* (Smendrick has three times the amount PJ has)
*  *z = y + 12* (Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick)

Now we can substitute to solve for *z* (the number of cards Becca has):

1. Substitute *3x* for *y* in the third equation: *z = 3x + 12*

2. Substitute *3x* for *y* in the first equation: *x + 3x + z = 341*

3. Simplify the second equation: *4x + z = 341*

4. Now we have two equations:
    * *z = 3x + 12*
    * *4x + z = 341*

5. Substitute *(3x + 12)* for *z* in the second equation: *4x + (3x + 12) = 341*

6. Simplify and solve for *x*:
    * *7x + 12 = 341*
    * *7x = 329*
    * *x = 47*

7. Substitute the value of *x* back into the equation *z = 3x + 12* to find *z*:
    * *z = (3 * 47) + 12*
    * *z = 141 + 12*
    * *z = 153*

"This problem involves a classic application of the relationship between speed, time, and distance.  

Let's denote:

*  *t* as the time it takes one kangaroo to cross the highway.
*  *s* as the speed of one kangaroo.

We know that distance = speed * time.  Since the distance is constant for all animals, we can set up the following equation:

*  *t* * *s* = distance

We are given that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.  Therefore:

* 18 hours * *s* = distance

We also know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, meaning a turtle's speed is *s*/2.  Let *t'* represent the time it takes one turtle to cross the highway.  Then:

* *t'* * (*s*/2) = distance

Substituting the value of distance from the first equation, we get:

* *t'* * (*s*/2) = 18 hours * *s*

Solving for *t'*, we find:

* *t'* = 36 hours

Finally, since we have four turtles, the total time it takes for them to cross the highway is:

* 36 hours/turtle * 4 turtles = 144 hours

"To determine the total hay needed, we first need to calculate the hay requirement for the sheep.  

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs.  Since a goat requires 5 pounds of hay, twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.  Subtracting 3 pounds, we find that each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

Now we can calculate the total hay needed for both goats and sheep:

* Goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
* Sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Distance Swum:**

James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, covering 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

**2.  Time for Initial Swim:**

At a speed of 2 miles per hour, the initial swim takes 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours.

**3.  Resting Period:**

He rests for half the time of his initial swim: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

**4.  Remaining Distance:**

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

**5.  Time for Final Swim:**

He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed (1 mile per hour), taking 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours.

**6.  Total Time:**

The total time is the sum of the swimming times and the resting period: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Define variables:**

    * Let 'a' represent the number of balls Jason carried.
    * Let 'o' represent the number of balls Jordan carried.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know 'a' = 2 * 'j' (Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey)
    * We know 'o' = 2 * 'a' (Jordan carried twice as many as Jason)
    * We also know 'j' + 'a' + 'o' = 7 (The total number of balls carried is 7)

* **Solve for the variables:**
    * Substitute '2j' for 'a' in the second equation: 'o' = 2 * (2j) = 4j
    * Substitute '2j' for 'a' and '4j' for 'o' in the third equation: j + 2j + 4j = 7
    * Combine like terms: 7j = 7
    * Solve for 'j': j = 1

* **Find the total number of balls:**
    * Since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey (j = 1), Jason carried 2 * 1 = 2 balls.
    * Jordan carried twice as many as Jason (a = 2), so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as  *A*, *S*, and *W* respectively. We are given the following system of equations:

*  *A* + *S* + *W* = 339 
*  *A* = *S* + 5
*  *S* = 4*W* - 13

To solve for *S*, we can utilize substitution.  Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

Simplifying, we have:

2*S* + *W* = 334

Now, substitute the third equation into the above equation:

"Let's break down this problem:

We know Comet Halley has an orbital period of 75 years.  This means it returns to a given point in its orbit every 75 years.

Bill's father observed the comet at age 30.  Bill observed it a second time when he was three times his father's age at the time of the first observation.  This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old during his second observation.

Since the time between observations is equal to one orbital period of the comet, Bill's age at his first observation (let's call this 'x') can be found by subtracting the comet's orbital period from his age at the second observation:

x = 90 - 75 = 15

"Buford's annual check volume can be calculated as follows:

* **Monthly Recurring:** Electric (1 check/month) + Gas (1 check/month) = 2 checks/month
* **Annual Monthly Recurring:** 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
* **Quarterly Recurring:** Pest & Lawn (1 check/quarter) * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year
* **Total Annual Checks:** 24 checks/year + 4 checks/year = 28 checks/year

Therefore, Buford writes 28 checks per year.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

* **Define Variables:**

   * Let 'x' represent the number of flights the first plane takes to France each day.

* **Set Up Equations:**

   * We know the first plane makes 88 flights total (since the second plane's 44 flights represent half of the first plane's).
   *  The first plane makes 66 flights to Greece (3/4 of its total flights).
   *  Therefore, the flights to France and Germany combined are 88 - 66 = 22.
   *  Since flights to France and Germany are split equally, x = 22 / 2 = 11.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Chikote's howl duration:** Chikote's howl is twice the length of Tobias's, so it lasts 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.

* **Combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls:**  Their combined howl time is 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

* **Igneous's howl duration:** Igneous howls for the same duration as Tobias and Chikote combined, meaning his howl lasts 60 seconds.

* **Total howl duration:** The total howl time of all three wolves is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

* **Total howl duration in minutes:**  To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"To determine the amount Adam contributed from his savings, we can subtract the total financial assistance he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers. 

His father gave him twice the amount his mother gave him, so his father's contribution was 2 * $6 = $12.

In total, Adam received $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as A, B, H, and W respectively. We are given the following information:

*  H = 2 * (A + B + H + W) / 4  (Helene's age is twice the average age)
*  A + B + H + W = 20 (Total age of the children)
*  A = 3 
*  B = 4

Substituting the known values into the first equation:

H = 2 * (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4

Simplifying and solving for H:

H = 2 * (7 + H + W) / 4
2H = 7 + H + W
H = 7 + W

Now, substitute the values of A, B, and the expression for H into the second equation:

3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20

Combining like terms:

14 + 2W = 20

Solving for W:

2W = 6
W = 3

"To determine the percentage of watermelon each adult receives, we can model this as a proportion problem. 

Let 'a' represent the size of one adult's slice and 'k' represent the size of one child's slice.  We know:

* a = 2k  (Each adult's slice is twice the size of a child's)
* a + a + k + k + k + k = 1 (The total watermelon is represented as 1)

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

* 2k + 2k + k + k + k + k = 1
* 7k = 1
* k = 1/7

Therefore, each adult receives:

* a = 2k = 2 * (1/7) = 2/7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100%:

* (2/7) * 100% = 28.57% (approximately)




**Answer:** Each adult gets approximately 28.57% of the watermelon.

"To determine the latest Jordan can start baking, we need to work backward from the desired serving time. 

The cake requires 20 minutes for batter preparation, 30 minutes for baking, 120 minutes (2 hours) for cooling, and 10 minutes for frosting.  This totals 180 minutes of time.

Converting this to hours, we have 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.

Subtracting this preparation time from the desired 5:00 pm serving time, we find the latest start time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

"To determine the porcupine population after a year, we need to consider the growth rate.  Assuming a closed population (no immigration or emigration), we can use the following formula:

*  N<sub>t</sub> = N<sub>0</sub> * (1 + r)<sup>t</sup>

Where:

* N<sub>t</sub> = Population at time t
* N<sub>0</sub> = Initial population
* r = Growth rate
* t = Time 

In this case:

* N<sub>0</sub> = 50
* r = (4 babies/female/month * 30 females / 50 total) - 1 = 0.48 (This represents the proportion of new individuals added to the population each month)
* t = 12 months

Plugging these values into the formula:

* N<sub>12</sub> = 50 * (1 + 0.48)<sup>12</sup> 
* N<sub>12</sub> ≈ 1490


**Therefore, there will be approximately 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.**

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as  'x'.

After the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, resulting in a loss of 0.09 * 5 = 0.45x.  The remaining charge is then 0.55x.

Subsequently, over the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% per hour, leading to a loss of 0.07 * 3 = 0.21x.

Finally, the remaining charge is 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x. We are given that this final charge is 28% of the original capacity, so:

0.34x = 0.28

Solving for x, we get:

Let's define the events:

*  S: Substitute teacher is present
*  E: Normal teacher grants an extension
*  D: Marcus convinces the teacher about the dog

We are given:

* P(S) = 0.50
* P(E|¬S) = 1 (If there's a substitute, there's no extension)
* P(E|S) = 0.40
* P(D|¬S ∧ ¬E) = 0.20

We want to find P(¬(S ∧ E ∧ D)), the probability Marcus has to turn in his homework.

Using the law of total probability:

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set.

We can express the number of balls retrieved in each set as follows:

* First set: *x* + 4
* Second set: *x*
* Third set: *x* / 2

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we have the equation:

(*x* + 4) + *x* + (*x* / 2) = 19

Combining like terms:

2.5*x* + 4 = 19

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2.5*x* = 15

Dividing both sides by 2.5:

*x* = 6

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, we substitute *x* = 6 into the expression for the first set:

First set: 6 + 4 = 10



**Answer:** Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"The car's value depreciates exponentially.  We can model this with the following formula:

*  V(t) = V₀ * (1 - r)^t

Where:

* V(t) is the value of the car at time t
* V₀ is the initial value of the car
* r is the depreciation rate
* t is the number of years

In this case:

* V₀ = $20000
* r = 0.21 
* t = 3 (from 2007 to 2010)

Plugging these values into the formula:

* V(3) = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3 
* V(3) = $20000 * (0.79)^3
* V(3) ≈ $9859.38

"Let's break down this problem systematically.

Let  'A' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted, and 'M' represent the number of eggs Madeline painted. We know A = M since they painted the same amount.

Let 'C' represent the number of eggs Camden painted, and 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted. We are given that C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get: (S + 12) + S = 30

Combining like terms: 2S + 12 = 30

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2S = 18

Dividing both sides by 2: S = 9

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find Camden's number of eggs: C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21

Since Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 - 30 = 26 eggs, and they painted the same amount, each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Finally, the difference between Camden's and Arnold's egg count is 21 - 13 = 8.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  We can represent this as a fraction: 5/9.

We know the total number of passengers is 84.  Let 'x' represent the number of women on the bus.  We can set up a proportion:

5/9 =  (number of men) / (total passengers)

Since the total passengers are 84, we can substitute:

To find the number of men, we can cross-multiply:

5 * 84 = 9 * (number of men)

420 = 9 * (number of men)

(number of men) = 420 / 9 = 46.67 (approximately)

Since we can't have fractions of people, we'll round this to 47 men.

Now we know there are 47 men and 84 - 47 = 37 women on the bus initially.

"To determine the additional bottles needed, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people.  

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

Therefore, the total number of bottles required is 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

Subtracting the current production capacity of 4200 bottles per day, we find the additional bottles needed: 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

"Let's break down this probability problem:

* **Define Events:**

    *  Let P be the event that a baby is wearing purple.
    *  Let B be the event that a baby is wearing a bow.

* **Probabilities:**

    *  P(P) = 3/4 (probability of a baby wearing purple)
    *  P(B|P) = 1/3 (probability of wearing a bow given they are wearing purple)
    *  P(B|¬P) = 1 (probability of wearing a bow given they are not wearing purple)

* **Calculate the Conditional Probability:**

We want to find P(P|B), the probability a baby is wearing purple given they are wearing a bow.  We can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(P|B) = [P(B|P) * P(P)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of wearing a bow, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|P) * P(P)  +  P(B|¬P) * P(¬P)
P(B) = (1/3) * (3/4) + 1 * (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(P|B) = [(1/3) * (3/4)] / (1/2) = 1/2

* **Convert to Percentage:**

P(P|B) = 0.5 * 100% = 50%

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as 'y'.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'y - 7'.  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making its length '4(y - 7)'.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the following equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (y = 12), we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

"Tim's estimation process demonstrates a common approach to solving this type of problem, though it relies on several simplifying assumptions. 

First, assuming a perfectly uniform packing density of 80% is unrealistic.  In reality, the arrangement of jelly beans within the jar would likely result in some voids and irregular packing, potentially affecting the actual number of jelly beans that can fit.

Second, the assumption of a constant 30% red jelly bean proportion across the entire jar is also an approximation.  

To determine the accuracy of Tim's guess, we need to calculate the difference between his estimated number of red jelly beans and the actual number: 864 - 900 = -36. 

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.
