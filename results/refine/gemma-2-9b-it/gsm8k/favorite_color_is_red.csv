"Okay, let's break down this house flipping scenario.  

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value jumped by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal.  

Here's how to figure that out:

*  She feeds each chicken 3 cups a day. With 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups total.
*  She's already given out 40 cups (15 + 25).
*  So, she needs 60 - 40 = 20 more cups for the last meal.

"Let's break this down.  Kylar's buying glasses in a pattern: full price, then discounted.  

*  He'll pay $5 for the first glass.
*  The second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.
*  This pattern repeats: $5, $3, $5, $3...

Since he's buying 16 glasses, that's 8 pairs. Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

"Let's break this download problem down:

* **Step 1: Initial Download Time** 
   If Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, a 200 GB file would take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

* **Step 2: Download Progress at Restart**
   The restart happens 40% of the way through, so that's 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes.

* **Step 3: Data Downloaded Before Restart**
   In those 40 minutes, she downloads 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

* **Step 4: Remaining Download Time**
   She has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

* **Step 5: Total Download Time**
   The remaining download takes 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

* **Step 6: Final Calculation**
   Adding the initial download time, restart time, and remaining download time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **First leg:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    *  He spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    *  He then drives 30 miles per hour for half an hour (0.5 hours), covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    *  He has 4 hours for the return trip, but has already used 2.5 hours, leaving 1.5 hours.
    *  In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.
    *  The total distance covered on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

* **Final distance:**  Since he traveled 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Let's break down this beehive problem!

*  We know there are 700 bees in total.
*  There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.

To figure out the number of worker bees, we can use a little logic:

1. **Think of the queens:**  Let's say there are 'x' queen bees.
2. **Baby bees:** Since there are twice as many babies as queens, there are 2*x baby bees.
3. **Worker bees:**  With twice as many worker bees as babies, we have 2 * (2*x) = 4*x worker bees.

Now we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 4x = 700

Combine like terms: 7x = 700

Divide both sides by 7: x = 100

So, there are 100 queen bees.

Now we can find the number of worker bees:

4 * x = 4 * 100 = 400

"Let's break this down.  We're dealing with exponential growth here, which means the price increases by a percentage of the *current* price, not just the original.

* The price goes up 20% every two months.

To find the price after 36 months, we need to figure out how many times this multiplication happens:

* 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

So, the final price is the original price multiplied by 1.20 eighteen times:

"Let's break this down.  

There are 3 numbers on a standard six-sided die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number bigger than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row,  you've got to think about it step-by-step.  The first roll has a 3 out of 6 chance of being even.  If it is, the second roll also has a 3 out of 6 chance of being even.  So, you multiply those probabilities together: (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36, which simplifies to 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Converting that to a percentage, we get 1/4 * 100% = 25%.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.  

* Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool had 4 minutes ago.
* Since the big pool had twice the water of the small pool then, it had 2*s* gallons.

After 4 minutes, both pools have lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

*  The small pool now has s - 16 gallons.
*  The big pool now has 2*s* - 16 gallons.

We're told the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool:

2*s* - 16 = 4(s - 16)

Let's solve for 's':

2*s* - 16 = 4*s* - 64
48 = 2*s*
s = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons four minutes ago.  Now it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees.  Then, it takes 40% longer to hit 400 degrees, which is an extra 8 minutes (20 * 0.40 = 8).  So, heating the oil takes a total of 28 minutes (20 + 8).

Senior programmers make $400 more than juniors, so they earn $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.  

The total salary for all senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, to find the total payroll for all programmers, we add the junior and senior programmer salaries: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"To figure this out, we need to work backward.  

* We know 20 people were on the bus heading to the third stop.
* Before the second stop, 7 people got off, so there were 20 + 7 = 27 people.
* Before the first stop, 8 people got on, meaning there were 27 - 8 = 19 people.

* He eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
* He gives 14 to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
* On his way home, he buys twice the number he gave away: 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.
* Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

"To figure this out, we need to think about the charging rate.  It gains 1% every 3 minutes.  

So, to get to 100% from 60%, it needs to gain another 40%.  That's 40% * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes.

Now, let's convert those minutes to hours: 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours.

"Let's crunch these numbers!

**Job A:**

* **Gross pay:** $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
* **Taxes:** $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
* **Net pay:** $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

"Let's break this problem down.  We know there are 200 students total and they're split into three groups.  If two of the groups have the same number of students, let's call that number 'x'. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than the others, so it has 'x - 10' students.

Putting it all together, we get the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Simplifying:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now we know each of the larger groups has 70 students.  The smallest group has 10 fewer:

70 - 10 = 60

"Let's break this down.  Each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2.  

*  If there are 'c' cows, that's 4c legs from the cows.
*  Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, there are 2c chickens, which is 4c legs.

*  The total number of animals is 60, so c + 2c = 60.

*  Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60.

*  Dividing both sides by 3, we find c = 20 cows.

*  That means there are 40 chickens (2 * 20).

"Let's break this down.  We know there are 180 heads total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations:

* Equation 1: c + d = 180  (Total heads)
* Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (Total bumps)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'c':  c = 180 - d

2. Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

In this case, with 15 red cards and 60% more green cards, we're looking at 9 extra green cards (0.60 * 15 = 9). That means there are 24 green cards in total.

The yellow cards are the sum of the red and green, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Adding all the colors together, we have 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down!

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily was a real find-er, she discovered 7 more insects than David.
*  David, he's a bit of a half-er, he found half the number of insects Bodhi did.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of logic and some algebra.  Let's say:

*  B = the number of insects Bodhi found
*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We can write this as equations:

*  L + D + B = 43 
*  L = D + 7
*  D = B / 2

Now, let's use substitution to solve for L (Lily's insects):

1. Since we know L = D + 7, we can substitute (D + 7) for L in the first equation:
   (D + 7) + D + B = 43

2.  Simplify that:
   2D + B + 7 = 43

3.  We also know D = B / 2, so substitute that in:
   2(B / 2) + B + 7 = 43

4.  Simplify again:
   B + B + 7 = 43

5.  Combine like terms:
   2B + 7 = 43

6.  Subtract 7 from both sides:
   2B = 36

7.  Divide both sides by 2:
   B = 18  (Bodhi found 18 insects!)

8.  Now that we know B, we can find D:
   D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 (David found 9 insects)

9.  Finally, we can find L:
   L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 (Lily found 16 insects!)



**Answer:** Lily found 16 insects.

* Ada's current daily usage is 12 kilowatt-hours (kWh) at $1.50 per kWh, so her daily cost is 12 * $1.50 = $18.00.

* Adding the new device increases her daily usage to 14 kWh, making her new daily cost 14 * $1.50 = $21.00.

* The difference in daily cost is $21.00 - $18.00 = $3.00.

*  Over a week, this difference amounts to $3.00/day * 7 days/week = $21.00.

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since April has 30 days, he needs to figure out how much to save each day to reach his goal.

He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as the first half.  Let's say he saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half. That means he'd save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

Here's the equation to represent his savings:

15x + 30(2x) = $1125

Simplifying:

15x + 60x = $1125
75x = $1125
x = $15

So, Elvis needs to save $15 each day in the first half.  In the second half, he'll save twice that amount, or $30 per day.

*  We know there are 4500 jelly beans total.
*  Red jelly beans are 1% *fewer* than blue, so let's say there are 'b' blue jelly beans. That means there are 0.99b red jelly beans.
*  Green jelly beans are 1% *more* than blue, so there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

"Let's break this down.  If Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week eating Cheerios, over 5 weeks that's a total weight loss of 6.25 pounds (1.25 * 5 = 6.25).

If he gains 1.75 pounds per week eating donuts, in 5 weeks he'll have gained 8.75 pounds (1.75 * 5 = 8.75).

The difference in weight between the two scenarios is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"Let's break this triangle problem down.  

*  We know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
*  Let's call the smallest angle 'x'.
*  The other angles are twice and three times the smallest angle, so they are 2x and 3x.

Now we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms: 6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30

The largest angle is 3x, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"This is a classic animal puzzle!  To figure out how many sheep Lee has, we need to use a little bit of algebra. 

Let's say:

*  *s* = the number of sheep
*  *g* = the number of geese

We know:

*  *s + g = 20*  (There are 20 heads in total)
*  *4s + 2g = 70* (There are 70 legs in total)

We can solve for *s* by using substitution.  Let's solve the first equation for *g*:

*g = 20 - s*

Now, substitute that value of *g* into the second equation:

*4s + 2(20 - s) = 70*

Simplify and solve for *s*:

*4s + 40 - 2s = 70*
*2s = 30*
*s = 15*

"Let's break this problem down.  We know there's a twin and a triplet involved, and the twin is 7 years older than the triplet.  

Let's say the triplet is 't' years old. That means the twin is 't + 7' years old.

Together, their ages add up to 44: t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

Simplifying the equation: 5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5: t = 6

So, the triplet is 6 years old.  

The twin is 7 years older, so the twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

"Let's break down this doggy vet bill!

First, those vaccines cost $20 each, so two of them are $20 * 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means we can represent the total bill as 100%.  If we let 'x' be the total bill, we know:

0.60x = heartworm check cost

The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check:

$40 + 0.60x = x

Solving for x:

0.60x = x - $40
0.40x = $40
x = $100

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* **Bananas:** 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* **Apples:** 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* **Oranges:** 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

"Let's break this down like a good clog dance routine!

First, we figure out how many taps Helga does with her arms down: 300 taps/minute (right) + 250 taps/minute (left) = 550 taps per minute.

Then, with her arms up, she does 200 taps/minute with each foot, for a total of 400 taps per minute.

Now, she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down and 2 minutes with her arms up.  

So, with her arms down, she taps 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 times.

And with her arms up, she taps 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 times.

Finally, we add those together: 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps total!

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let your brother's age be ""b""
*  Let your sister's age be ""s""
*  Let your age be ""y""

We know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87

Combining like terms in the last equation: 4b + y + s = 88

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Simplifying: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

Now, substitute 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

*  Let Peter's age be represented by ""P""
*  Let Paul's age be represented by ""Pa""
*  Let John's age be represented by ""J""

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Let's substitute to find Peter's age (P):

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4.  Substitute J = 20 back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50



Peter's age is 50.

"Let's break down this widget-making problem!

First, we need to figure out how many widgets each machine produces in a month.  The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in a 24-hour day, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Over 30 days, that's 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in a day it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.  Over 30 days, that's 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 would earn 43,200 * $6 = $259,200.

The WidgetMaster 9000 would earn 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

Finally, the difference in earnings is $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

With 15 goats needing 5 pounds each, that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.

"Let's solve this Pokemon problem!  

* Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find out how many Pokemon Stan caught (S), we can use substitution:

1.  Since A = S + 5, substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
    (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3.  Solve for W in terms of S using the third equation:
    W = (S + 13) / 4

4. Substitute this value of W into the simplified equation:
    2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

5. Multiply both sides by 4:
    8S + S + 13 = 1336

6. Combine like terms:
    9S + 13 = 1336

7. Subtract 13 from both sides:
    9S = 1323

8. Divide both sides by 9:
    S = 147

"Let's break down this crawfish feast!  

Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday, which is a good start. Then he really went to town on Friday, catching 4 times that amount, so 3 pounds * 4 = 12 pounds.  On Saturday, he slowed down a bit and caught half of Friday's catch, which is 12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds.

Adding up all his catches, Joe has 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds of crawfish.

"Let's figure out how much Pat will spend.  

First, we need to know how many plants she needs.  Her flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant needs 12 inches of space.  That means she needs 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches of space for the plants.  

She also needs 1.5 feet of space between each plant, which is 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.  So, the total space needed is 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

That means she needs 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't buy half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

She already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558.

"Let's break this down.  Filling a pool is all about volume, and we can figure that out with a simple formula:

Volume = width x length x depth

In this case, the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  So:

Volume = 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet

Now, the pool company says they need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to figure out how many gallons of water are needed.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9

"Let's break this problem down.  

*  Let 'x' represent the amount the first person received.

* The second person got $80 more than the first, so they received x + $80.

* The third person received twice the amount of the second person, meaning they received 2(x + $80).

*  The total amount divided among the three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Now, let's solve for x:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920
4x + $240 = $1920
4x = $1680
x = $420

"Depreciation is a tricky beast, but I've crunched the numbers for you.  

Here's how we can figure out the car's value in 2010:

* **Year 2008:**  The car loses 21% of its value, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  So, it's worth $20000 - $4200 = $15800.

* **Year 2009:**  Another 21% depreciation hits, meaning it loses $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  That leaves us with $15800 - $3318 = $12482.

* **Year 2010:**  One more year, another 21% hit: $12482 * 0.21 = $2622.62.  The final value in 2010 is $12482 - $2622.62 = $9859.38.

"Okay, let's break down this credit card problem.  

First, Sheila's balance starts at $85.00, but she returns an item for $15.00, so that's $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, she buys a frying pan that's 20% off $20.00.  That means she saves $4.00 (20% of $20.00), and the frying pan costs $16.00.

Then, she buys a set of towels that's 10% off $30.00. That's a savings of $3.00 (10% of $30.00), and the towels cost $27.00.

Finally, she adds the frying pan ($16.00) and the towels ($27.00) to her balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

"This problem highlights a common financial pitfall!  It looks like Lauren is spending more than she's earning.  To figure out how long it'll take her to save for retirement, we need to know if she can increase her savings or decrease her expenses. 

Let's break it down:

* **Current Savings:** 20% of $100,000 = $20,000 per year
* **Annual Expenses:** 40% of $100,000 = $40,000 per year
* **Annual Deficit:** $40,000 - $20,000 = -$20,000

With a negative annual surplus, Lauren is actually spending $20,000 more each year than she's saving.  She'll need to adjust her budget to reach her retirement goal.

They still need 220 more to reach the 420 total needed for the order (400 toys + 20).

So, the fifth worker must have made 220 toys in their 10-hour shift.  That means they made 22 toys per hour (220 toys / 10 hours).

"Let's break this problem down step by step.  

*  We know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30.  
*  Let's say 'x' represents the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted each.
*  That means together they painted 2x eggs.
*  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's say Sarah painted 'y' eggs, and Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.
*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30 
*  Combining like terms, we get 2y + 12 = 30
*  Subtracting 12 from both sides, we have 2y = 18
*  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs).
*  Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, he painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
*  We also know that 2x + 30 = 56 (the total number of eggs).
*  Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 26
*  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 13 (Arnold painted 13 eggs).
*  Finally, to find the difference, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break this down.  Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so that's 200 ounces of crayons right there.  

Each box holds 8 crayons, so he'll need 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, all the boxes together weigh 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes, we get 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

"You know, when it comes to ropes, red is always the most striking color!  

Let's break this problem down:

*  We know the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  All three ropes together measure 37 centimeters.

Let's use a little algebra to figure this out.  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.  That means the blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long, and the red rope is 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.  Now we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Rissa received three times the amount Ronnie did, so she started with 3 * $5 = $15.

Since they both gave the same amount to their sister, let's call that amount 'x'.  Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount, meaning:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides:

-x = -3

Finally, multiplying both sides by -1:

x = $3

This means each of them gave $3 to their sister.  

Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"Let's break this problem down.  We can use a little algebra to figure out Colin's age.

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

*  Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can solve for 'c':

1.  Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:
    * w = 5c + 35

2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
    * c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

* Carly needs to make enough treats for 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats, so she needs a total of 5 * 2 = 10 treats.
*  Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes.
*  Carly makes 3 times the number of cupcakes minus 2 for brownies, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.
*  The total number of cupcakes and brownies is 10, so we have the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10
*  Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10
*  Adding 2 to both sides, we have 4c = 12
*  Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find c = 3

* Ryan earns $6 per week for chores and did them for 3 weeks, so he has $6 * 3 = $18.

* He spent $5.00 on ice cream for himself and his friends.

* That leaves him with $18 - $5.00 = $13.00 for movies.

*  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13.00 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Let's break this relay race problem down:

* **Aaron's Speed:** Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Speed:** Vanessa runs half as fast as Aaron, meaning her speed is 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Time:** To find Vanessa's time, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.  She ran 4 miles at 0.0625 miles per minute, so her time is 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

"A dockhand needs to make sure he has enough line for every foot of dock.  That's standard practice to avoid any snags or accidents.  He'll need 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he's got 200 feet of dock.  So, that's 200 feet * 3 feet per foot = 600 feet of line needed.  He already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet more.

"Let's figure this out!  

* Let 'c' be the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' be the number of cows.

We know:

* c + w = 20  (All the animals together)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (Total legs)

We can use a little algebra to solve for 'c'.  Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for 'w':

* w = 20 - c

Now, substitute that value of 'w' into the second equation:

* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
* -2c = -10
* c = 5
