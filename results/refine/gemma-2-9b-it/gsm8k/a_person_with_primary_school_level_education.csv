"First, we add the price of the house and the repairs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Then, the house got more expensive by 150%, so we add 150% of the original price: $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

Now we add that to the price after the repairs: $130,000 + $120,000 = $250,000.

Finally, we subtract the total cost to find the profit: $250,000 - $130,000 = $120,000.

"Let's think about this step by step:

* John drove 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, so he went 3 * 60 = 180 miles away.

* Then he drove back for 4 hours, but 2 of those hours he was stuck in traffic, so he only drove for 4 - 2 = 2 hours.

* He drove for half an hour at 30 miles per hour, which is 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

* He had 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours left to drive back.

* At 80 miles per hour, he drove 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles in that time.

"If the book cost $19.50 after a 25% discount, we need to figure out the original price.  

Imagine the original price is like a whole pizza.  A 25% discount means Kyle got a quarter of the pizza taken off.  

So, the $19.50 he paid is like 3/4 of the whole pizza.  

To find the whole pizza (the original price), we can think:

* If 3/4 of the pizza is $19.50, then 1/4 of the pizza is $19.50 divided by 3, which is $6.50.

*  The whole pizza (the original price) is 4 times $6.50, which is $26.00.

Since each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie, we need to figure out how much more that is.  A blue tie costs $40, so 50% of that is $40 * 0.50 = $20.  That means a red tie costs $40 + $20 = $60.

Then, the puppy needs 2 cups a day after that, for the rest of the year.  There are 365 days in a year, and we already used up 180 days, so that leaves 365 - 180 = 185 days.

So, the puppy needs 185 days times 2 cups a day, which is 370 cups.

In total, the puppy needs 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups in the first year.

Each bag has 110 cups, so Cecilia needs 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

He has 2 classes on Tuesday and Thursday, and each class is 2 hours long, so that's 2 times 2 hours, which is 4 hours each day.

So, he has 3 hours + 3 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

And he has 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours on Tuesday and Thursday.

That means he has 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours of classes each week.

In a semester with 16 weeks, he has 17 hours * 16 weeks = 272 hours of classes.

"The desk started at $200. Then, three other people bid, and each time the price went up by $50. That's $50 x 3 = $150 more.  So the desk cost $200 + $150 = $350.

"Let's figure this out!

* He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 60 miles each day.
* He drives 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles each week.
*  He drives for 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles a year.
*  He pays $2 for every mile, so that's 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 for driving.
*  He also gives his driver $150 every month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800 a year.
*  To find the total, we add the driving cost and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

"Elise sold 45 books this year and she sold twice as many the first year, so she sold 45 times 2 which is 90 books the first year.  That means she sold 90 plus 45 which is 135 books in the first two years.  She had 250 books to sell and 50 are left, so she sold 250 minus 50 which is 200 books.  She sold 200 minus 135 which is 65 books in the third year.  Each book sells for $20, so she made 45 times 20 which is $900 this year.

"Watson works 10 hours each day and gets $10 for each hour. So he makes $10 * 10 = $100 each day.

He works 5 days a week, so he makes $100 * 5 = $500 each week.

He also gets an extra $300 each week if the company does well. So he makes $500 + $300 = $800 each week.

April has 4 weeks, so he makes $800 * 4 = $3200 in April.

"Let's think about this like a team game!

* The defense has *d* players.

"Furniture United costs $1350 plus $350 each month for 6 months. That's $2100 for the months, so the total is $1350 + $2100 = $3450.

Cozy Homes costs $1100 plus $250 each month for 9 months. That's $2250 for the months, so the total is $1100 + $2250 = $3350.

If we take away Cozy Homes' price from Furniture United's price, we get $3450 - $3350 = $100.

"Okay, so we have 200 students and they are split into 3 groups.  Two of the groups have the same number of kids, and the smallest group has 10 fewer kids than the bigger groups.

Let's think: if we take away 10 kids from a group, we get the smallest group.  

To find out how many kids are in each of the bigger groups, we can try adding up some numbers.  If we add 70 and 70, that's 140 kids.  

If we add 10 more kids to that, we get 150.  That means each of the bigger groups has 70 kids.

* Elliott walked 5,000 steps to and from school.
* Then he walked 1,000 more with his friend. That's 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.
* He needed to walk 2,000 more steps to reach 10,000.

"First, Toby needs 30 minutes to read the whole book 'cause he reads 300 words every minute and the book has 9000 words.

"Okay, so Carolyn hired 40 workers and they each make $15 an hour.  That means they make $15 * 40 = $600 each week.

In May, they worked for a whole month, which is 4 weeks, so each worker made $600 * 4 = $2400.

Since there are 40 workers, they paid out $2400 * 40 = $96,000 in May.

Then, some workers left, so now there are 40 - 10 = 30 workers.

So in June, they paid out $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

In total, they paid out $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Sally bought two pounds of taffy.  The first pound was $3.00 and the second pound was half off, so it cost $1.50.  That means the taffy cost $3.00 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought seashells for $1.50 and four magnets that cost $0.25 each, so they cost $0.25 x 4 = $1.00.

To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to add up everything she spent: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally started with $10.00 and spent $7.00, so she has $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.

"Marcy makes a lot of candles, 50,000 to be exact!  

She says they are almost never going to explode, only 1% of them might.  

But 5% of the ones that *do* explode also smell like wet dog.  

So, we need to figure out how many candles are both exploding AND smell like wet dog.

Let's think:

* 1% of 50,000 candles is 500 candles (because 1 out of every 100 candles might explode).
* 5% of those 500 candles smell like wet dog, so that's 25 candles (because 5 out of every 100 candles that explode smell bad).

"Let's think about this like this:

* Camels have two bumps, and dromedaries have one bump.
* We know there are 304 bumps in total.

If all the bumps were from camels, we'd need 304 bumps / 2 bumps per camel = 152 camels.  But that's too many because we also have dromedaries!

Let's try guessing. If we have 56 dromedaries, that's 56 bumps. That leaves 304 bumps - 56 bumps = 248 bumps for the camels.

248 bumps / 2 bumps per camel = 124 camels.

That means we have 56 dromedaries and 124 camels.  Let's check if that adds up to 180 heads: 56 + 124 = 180!

*  He saved some money on the tattered jeans and some on the jogger jeans.

*  We know he saved $2 on the jogger jeans because that's 1/3 of the total savings.

*  That means he saved $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans.

* The plane tickets cost $5000 each, so for two people that's $5000 x 2 = $10000.
* The hotel is more expensive because it's a busy weekend.  It usually costs $1500 per day, but it's 20% more, so that's $1500 x 0.20 = $300 extra each day.
* So each day at the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800.
* For three days, the hotel costs $1800 x 3 = $5400.
*  To find the total cost, we add the plane tickets and the hotel: $10000 + $5400 = $15400.

"First, we need to find out how much Susan weighs.  Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, who weighs 150 pounds. So Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Then we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, who weighs 130 pounds. So Bob weighs 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

Now we know how much all three friends weigh: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds).  To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

"The smallest angle is like the baby of the triangle!

So, 200 flowers / 5 groups = 40 flowers in each group.

Then, 4 groups * 40 flowers/group = 160 flowers bloomed.

"Ashley's internet is fast!  It's 20 little bits every second.  

There are lots of little bits in a big bit, like 1000 little bits make one big bit. So, we need to see how many big bits are in 20 little bits.

20 little bits / 1000 little bits per big bit = 0.02 big bits per second.

Now, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so let's see how many big bits she gets in an hour:

0.02 big bits per second * 60 seconds per minute * 60 minutes per hour = 7.2 big bits per hour.

There are 7 days in a week, so it pulled 6 cars for 4 days, which is 6 x 4 = 24 cars.

* The fancy lights cost $1,500 extra.

"Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so that's 7 + 5 = 12 hours total.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the time left, which is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

That means she plays soccer for 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

So, she plays soccer for 6 out of 12 hours, which is 6/12 = 1/2.

Half is the same as 50%.

"First, we need to find out how many wheels are needed for all the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels each = 228 wheels.

Then we need to find out how many wheels are needed for all the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels each = 146 wheels.

Now let's add those together: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Finally, we subtract the wheels needed from the box of wheels: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

"First, we need to find out how much the discount is.  Twenty percent of $1000 is $200 (because 20 out of 100 is 20 cents, and 20 cents of $10 means $200).

"Okay, so Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series, which means 600 / 3 = 200 movies are in series.  He can get those for cheaper, just $6 each instead of $10!

That means those series movies cost 200 * $6 = $1200.

The rest of his movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  Forty percent of those are old movies, so that's 400 * 0.40 = 160 old movies.

Those old movies cost 160 * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies. Those cost 240 * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"First, we need to find out how fast they hiked. They drove 50 miles per hour, and half of that is 25 miles per hour.  They hiked 5 miles per hour slower than that, so they hiked 20 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how far they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours and went 20 miles per hour, so they hiked 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

Then, we need to find out how far they drove. They drove for 6 hours total and hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Finally, we need to find out the total distance. They drove 4.5 hours at 50 miles per hour, so they drove 4.5 * 50 = 225 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

"They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 times a day times 5 days which is 15 times.

Then they ride twice as much on two other days, so that's 3 times a day times 2 which is 6 times each day.

On those two days, they ride 6 times a day times 2 days, which is 12 times.

So in total, they ride 15 times plus 12 times, which is 27 times!

"Bob started with 4 white fish and 3 orange fish.  He bought some more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's think about how many white fish he could have bought. If he bought 1 white fish, he would have 5 white fish. That means he would have 10 orange fish (because twice as many orange as white).  

That doesn't sound right, because he only bought 17 fish total.  

Let's try 2 white fish. That means he would have 6 white fish. That means he would have 12 orange fish.  

That still doesn't sound right.  

Let's try 3 white fish. That means he would have 7 white fish. That means he would have 14 orange fish.

"Andy's car uses 10 miles of gas for every gallon.  He drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home, so that's 10 miles each day.

Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

His friends who play for less time use 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each.  That's 2 friends * 24 quarters = 48 quarters.

"Let's see!

The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800.  That means they cost a total of $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Gabriel has $5000 from his work and $200 from his brother, so he has $5000 + $200 = $5200.

To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract how much he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

* Jack has 60 dishes, and he has twice as many dishes as socks, so he has 60 dishes / 2 = 30 socks.

* Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 socks * 2 = 60 socks.

* Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 dishes / 2 = 30 dishes.

"Here's how to solve it:

*  5 kids are good at math only.
*  Then there are kids good at both math and English, but we don't know how many.
*  We know 8 kids are good at English only.

So, to find out how many are good at math, we add the kids good at math only and the kids good at both: 5 + (kids good at both) = total kids good at math. 

We know there are 20 kids in total, so  5 + (kids good at both) = 20.

To find out how many are good at both, we subtract 5 from 20: 20 - 5 = 15 kids are good at both math and English.

Finally, we add the kids good at math only and the kids good at both: 5 + 15 = 20 kids.

"Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote howls for twice as long, so he howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.  

Together Tobias and Chikote howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

Igneous howls for the same amount of time as Tobias and Chikote, so he howls for 60 seconds too.

All together they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is equal to 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Doctor Jones works for nine hours.  He spends time checking on patients and seeing people with appointments.  Checking on patients takes 20 minutes for each patient, and he has nine patients. That's 20 times 9, which is 180 minutes.  

His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has ten appointments. That's 30 times 10, which is 300 minutes.

So he spends 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes on patients and appointments.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours on patients and appointments.

That means he has 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left for his records.

"Donovan cooked for some time, and Betsy cooked for longer.  Together they cooked for 98 minutes. Betsy cooked 18 minutes longer than Donovan.  

Let's think: if we take away 18 minutes from Betsy's time, it would be the same as Donovan's time.  

So, to find out how long Betsy cooked, we need to add 18 minutes to Donovan's time.  


Let's say Donovan cooked for 40 minutes.  That means Betsy cooked for 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  She takes 40 minutes to walk the 2 miles on the beach.  

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, it takes her half the time to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.  That means it takes her 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes to walk the sidewalk.

In total, it takes her 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes to walk the whole trail.

"First, we need to find out how many cows Melanie's dad gets. He gets 20 cows every day for three weeks, which is 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.  So he gets 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Then we add the cows he started with: 420 cows + 50 cows = 470 cows.

Now let's do the chickens. He gets 10 chickens every day for 21 days, so that's 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Then we add the chickens he started with: 210 chickens + 20 chickens = 230 chickens.

"Rissa got three times more money than Ronnie, so she got $15.  Ronnie got $5.

They both gave the same amount to their sister, so let's say they each gave $x.

Rissa had $15 and gave away $x, so she has $15 - x left. We know that's 4/5 of her money, so:

$15 - x = $12
-x = -3
x = $3

"Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 colors.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's 3 x 6 = 18 colors.

That means she had 8 + 18 = 26 colors in total.

Her sister took one palette, which had 4 colors, so Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 colors left.

She used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 / 2 = 3 colors.

So Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

"Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is 7 times taller than him. So the house is 60 * 7 = 420 inches tall.

The first floor is 3 times taller than Mattison, so it's 60 * 3 = 180 inches tall.

To find how high the roof is from the second floor, we need to subtract the first floor height from the house height: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Then, we subtract the first floor height again to find the roof height from the second floor: 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

One percent of 1600 is 16.

"Okay, so Tim makes a yummy mix with passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey.  

Each jar needs 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 each, so that's 2 times 6 which is $12.

Then he needs 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 each, so that's 1.5 times 8 which is $12.

He also needs 2 pounds of honey at $10 each, so that's 2 times 10 which is $20.

That means each jar costs $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 to make.

He sells each jar for $50, so he makes $50 - $44 = $6 profit on each jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes $6 times 10 which is $60.

"Let's think about this!

* Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 
* We know there are 20 animals in total.

If we had only chickens, we'd have 20 * 2 = 40 legs.  That's too many! So there must be some cows.
