"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18

"Let's break this down:

*  First, we find out how many students chose contemporary dance: 20 students * 20% = 4 students.

*  That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.

*  Next, we see how many of those 16 students chose jazz: 16 students * 25% = 4 students.

*  Finally, the rest must have chosen hip-hop: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students.

*  To find the percentage of the whole class who chose hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of students: 12 students / 20 students = 0.6

*  Converting that decimal to a percentage, we get 0.6 * 100% = 60%

If the book is selling for $19.50 after a 25% discount, that means $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).

To find the original price, we can set up a proportion:

75/100 = $19.50 / x

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

Let's say their combined age is represented by the variable 'x'. We can set up an equation:

7a + 11a = x

Since we know their total age is 162, we can substitute:

7a + 11a = 162

Combining like terms:

18a = 162

Now, solve for 'a':

a = 162 / 18

a = 9

This means each 'a' in our ratio represents 9 years.  

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we use his current age (11a):

Allen's current age = 11 * 9 = 99

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109

Together, they equal 110:  s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms: 2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: s = 40

Finally, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher: 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.

* Third level: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Adding all the levels together: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

"Okay, so the team played 22 games in total and won 8 more than they lost.  To figure out how many they won, we can think of it like this:

*  Let's say they lost 'x' games.
*  They won 'x + 8' games.

Since all the games add up to 22, we have the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Simplifying that: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

And finally, dividing both sides by 2: x = 7

So they lost 7 games.

*  There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.

To find the number of worker bees, we can use a bit of logic:

1. **Think about the smallest possible number of queens:**  If there were only one queen, there would be two babies, and then four worker bees. That's already getting close to our total!

2. **Let's try a few more queens:**  If we have 100 queens, that means there are 200 baby bees (100 x 2), and 400 worker bees (200 x 2).

3. **Does this add up?**  100 queens + 200 babies + 400 worker bees = 700 bees!


**Answer:** There are 400 worker bees.

* Milk: $2
* Eggs: $3
* Light bulbs: $3

"As a pineapple farmer, I can tell you that John can harvest a lot of pineapples!  

Here's how to figure that out:

* He has 10 hectares of pineapples, and each hectare yields 100 pineapples. So, in total, he has 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples.
* Since he harvests every 3 months, and there are 4 quarters in a year, he harvests 4 times a year.

We know:

*  s = 2b  (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
*  (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28 (In two years, their ages add up to 28)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 's':

1. Substitute '2b' for 's' in the second equation:
   (2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

2. Simplify and solve for 'b':
   3b + 4 = 28
   3b = 24
   b = 8

3. Substitute the value of 'b' (8) back into the equation s = 2b:
   s = 2 * 8
   s = 16

"Let's break down Micheal's biking journey:

* **Phase 1:** He rode 25 kilometers per ride, 5 times a week for 4 weeks.  That's 25 km/ride * 5 rides/week = 125 km per week.  Over four weeks, he covered 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

* **Phase 2:**  He switched to 2 rides a week, each covering 60 kilometers, for 3 weeks.  That's 60 km/ride * 2 rides/week = 120 km per week.  Over three weeks, he covered 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

"Let's figure this out.  We know Jerry gets 42 eggs a day.  Red chickens lay 3 eggs each, and white chickens lay 5.  

If we let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens, we can set up two equations:

* 3r + 5w = 42  (The total number of eggs)
* w = r + 2   (There are two more white chickens than red chickens)

We can substitute the second equation into the first one:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Now we can solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to figure out the total distance and then divide that by his walking speed. 

The park is a rectangle, so we can find the perimeter (the total distance around the outside) by using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now we know Gary walks 15 miles and his speed is 3 miles per hour.  We can calculate the time:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

*  Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool has now.

* Since the pools leak at 4 gallons per minute,  4 minutes ago, the small pool had 's + 16' gallons.

*  We know the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2*(s + 16) gallons.

* Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool. This means: 2*(s + 16) - 16 = 4*(s)

* Simplifying the equation: 2s + 32 - 16 = 4s
* Combining like terms: 16 = 2s
* Solving for 's': s = 8

First, we need to see how many water type cards James has left after losing some. He started with 40 and lost 8, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

Next, we need to know the total number of cards James has now. He has 30 fire, 34 grass, and 32 water cards, for a total of 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards.

Finally, to find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100%: (32 / 96) * 100% = 33.33%.

Rounding that to the nearest integer, the chance of picking a water type card is 33%.

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

* **Scene 1:**  The first scene has twice the lines of the song, which has 54 lines. So, Scene 1 has 54 * 2 = 108 lines.  Since Sean only has a third of those lines, he needs to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

* **Scene 2:** The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, meaning it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.  Four-fifths of those lines are Sean's, so he needs to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

* **Total:** To find the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize, add up the lines from each scene and the song: 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.

"Let's break this problem down.  

If we let 'x' represent the size of the two equal groups, we know:

* x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

* 3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

* 3x = 210

"Let's figure this out!

* If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this: for every cow, there are two chickens. 
*  Since we know there are 60 animals total, we can represent the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c'.
*  Together, they make 60: c + 2c = 60
*  Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60
*  Dividing both sides by 3, we find that there are 20 cows (c = 20).
*  That means there are 40 chickens (2 * 20 = 40).
*  Cows have 4 legs, so 20 cows have 80 legs (20 * 4 = 80).
*  Chickens have 2 legs, so 40 chickens have 80 legs (40 * 2 = 80).
*  Adding the legs of the cows and chickens, we get a total of 160 legs (80 + 80 = 160).

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Joanne's shortest trees:** Joanne picked half as many apples from the shortest trees as the tallest trees, so she got 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

* **Joanne's total (excluding average):**  Joanne picked 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

* **Sister's apples:** The sister picked 60 apples from the tallest trees and 45 apples from the shortest trees, for a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Joanne's average apples:** Since the sisters picked a total of 500 apples, Joanne must have picked 500 - 105 = 395 apples.  Subtracting her apples from the tallest and shortest trees, she picked 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees.

* Let 'x' represent the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

* Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he'll save 2x each day during those 15 days.

* **Calculate the percentage difference:** The oven is 4% hotter (18 / 450 * 100% = 4%).
* **Adjust the recipe temperature:**  To compensate for the 4% overshoot, Maggie needs to set the oven to a lower temperature.  Let's say 'x' is the temperature she should set. The actual temperature will be x + (0.04x) = 520.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know the total number of jelly beans is 4500.  Let's say 'b' represents the number of blue jelly beans.  

*  The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than blue, so there are 0.99b red jelly beans.
*  The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than blue, so there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

Now we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

To find 'b', divide both sides by 2.99:

b ≈ 1505

Now we can find the number of green jelly beans:

1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

And the number of red jelly beans:

0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490

Finally, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1520 - 1490 = 30

"Let's figure this out.  We know there are 20 heads total, and each sheep has one head, and each goose has one head.  We also know there are 70 legs in total, with sheep having 4 legs and geese having 2.

We can set up two equations:

*  s + g = 20  (Heads)
*  4s + 2g = 70 (Legs)

To solve for 's', we can use substitution.  From the first equation, we know g = 20 - s.  Let's plug that into the second equation:

* 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Simplify and solve for 's':

* 4s + 40 - 2s = 70

"Let's break down John's vet bill:

* **Vaccines:** 2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

* **Heartworm Check:**  Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can represent the total bill as 'x'.  So, 0.60x = heartworm check cost.

* **Total Bill:** $40 (vaccines) + 0.60x (heartworm check) = x (total bill)

* **Solving for x:**
    *  Subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40
    *  Subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40
    *  Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x
    *  Divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100

* **Change:** $125 (initial amount) - $100 (total bill) = $25

"Let's break down the cost of this fruit crate:

* **Bananas:** Each banana costs twice as much as an apple, so they cost $0.50 * 2 = $1.00 each.
* **Oranges:** Oranges are the priciest at three times the cost of a banana, making them $1.00 * 3 = $3.00 each.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* **Bananas:** 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* **Apples:** 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* **Oranges:** 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, these 60 small stickers are worth 60 small buttons.  These 60 small buttons can be traded for 60 / 3 = 20 large buttons.

* **Total Buttons:**  Lorraine now has 9 large buttons (from the first trade) + 20 large buttons (from the second trade) = 29 large buttons.  She also has 27 small buttons.

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7: x = 47

Now we can find Becca's cards: 3x + 12 = (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153


Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's figure out Milly's loss. 

First, the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound times 4 pounds, which is $1.40.  Then, add the mileage cost: $0.08 per mile times 20 miles equals $1.60.  The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Amazon will refund 75% of the $32 purchase price, so that's $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, subtract the refund from the shipping cost: $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

* Let your brother's age be 'b'
* Let your sister's age be 's'
* Let your age be 'y'

We know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87

Simplifying the last equation: 4b + y + s = 88

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Combining like terms: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

Now, substitute 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

"To figure this out, we need to figure out how much material Jo needs per mask type and then scale that up for the number of masks she wants to make.

* **Small masks:** She uses 2 yards of material for 4 small masks, so that's 0.5 yards per small mask (2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask).

* **Large masks:** She uses 2.25 yards for 3 large masks, so that's 0.75 yards per large mask (2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask).

Now let's calculate the total material:

* **Small masks:** 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards
* **Large masks:** 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards

* **Total:** 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* Duncan is 60 years old now, so eight years ago he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

*  We know that Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was twice Adam's age four years ago.  Let Adam's age four years ago be represented by 'x'.  We can set up the equation: 52 = 2x

* Solving for x, we find that Adam's age four years ago was x = 26.

*  Therefore, Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30 years old.

*  In eight years, Adam will be 30 + 8 = 38 years old.

3J = 90

J = 30

"Let's figure this out!  

* Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339  (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find out how many Pokemon Stan caught (S), we can use substitution:

1.  Since A = S + 5, we can substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
    (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3.  We also know S = 4W - 13.  Let's substitute that into the simplified equation:
    2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

4. Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
    8S + S + 13 = 1336

5. Combine like terms:
    9S + 13 = 1336

6. Subtract 13 from both sides:
    9S = 1323

7. Divide both sides by 9:
    S = 147

First, we need to know how many plants Pat needs.  She has 111 feet of flower bed and each plant needs 12 inches of space, plus 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant.  

So, the total space needed for the plants is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot - 18 inches = 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

That means Pat needs 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since she can't have half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558 at the store.

If each adult gets a slice twice as big as a kid's slice, we can think of it this way:

*  Let 'k' represent the size of one kid's slice.
*  Each adult gets 2k.

The total watermelon is divided into 6 slices, so:

4k (kids' slices) + 2 * 2k (adults' slices) = 6

Simplifying the equation:

4k + 4k = 6
8k = 6
k = 6/8 = 0.75

This means each kid gets a slice of 0.75.  

Since each adult gets 2k, they get 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

To find the percentage, we divide the adult's share by the total slices and multiply by 100%:

(1.5 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 25%

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher** 
   There's a 50% chance Marcus has a substitute, who might not collect homework.

* **Scenario 2: Normal Teacher**
   If the regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension. This means there's a 60% chance she'll expect the homework.

* **Scenario 3: Dog Ate My Homework**
   Even if no extension is given, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher.

To find the probability Marcus *has* to turn in the homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he *doesn't* get an out:

*  Substitute teacher (50%) * No extension needed (100%) = 50%
*  Normal teacher (50%) * No extension (60%) * No dog excuse (80%) = 24%

Adding those probabilities together: 50% + 24% = 74%

* Simplifying the equation: x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920

* Combining like terms: 4x + $240 = $1920

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

*  We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's use variables to represent the lengths:

*  Let 'y' be the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplify and solve for 'y':

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Finally, find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

* **Rissa's remaining money:** Rissa had $15 and gave away 'x', leaving her with $15 - x. We know this is equal to 4/5 of her original amount: $15 - x = (4/5) * $15

* **Solving for x:**
   * $15 - x = $12

Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

*  In 25 years, Colin will be 'c + 25' years old, and this will be one-third of Wendy's current age: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for 'w':
w = 5c + 35

Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':
3c + 75 = 5c + 35
40 = 2c
c = 20

"To figure out how much fabric Luke needs, we first need to find the total width of all the windows.  

That's 5 windows * 35 inches per window = 175 inches.

"Let me break that down for you.  

The first 16 minutes cost $0.25 per minute, so that's 16 * $0.25 = $4.00.

After 16 minutes, the rate drops to $0.20 per minute.  The remaining minutes are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes.

So, the cost for those extra minutes is 20 * $0.20 = $4.00.

Adding those together, the total cost is $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

* **T-shirts:** Since each T-shirt is 50% off, Jake pays half price for the second one. That means he spends $8 for the first shirt and $4 for the second.  The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

* **Shoes:**  A 40% discount on the shoes means Jake saves $40 * 0.40 = $16.  The final price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

* **Total:** Jake spends $12 on T-shirts + $24 on shoes = $36 in total.

"Let's break this relay race problem down:

* **Aaron's Speed:** Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Speed:** Vanessa runs half as fast as Aaron, meaning her speed is 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Time:** To find Vanessa's time, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.  She ran 4 miles at 0.0625 miles per minute, so her time is 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

"Let's figure this out!  

We know Farmer Brown has 20 animals total, and they have 70 legs altogether.  

* Chickens have 2 legs each.
* Cows have 4 legs each.

Let's use some algebra to solve this:

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We can set up two equations:

1.  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals)
2.  2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs)

Solving for 'c' (the number of chickens):

From equation 1, we can say w = 20 - c.  

Substitute that into equation 2:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5
