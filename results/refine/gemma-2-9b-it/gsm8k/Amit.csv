"Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal. 

Here's how I figured that out:

* Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
* With 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed total.
* She's already given out 40 cups (15 + 25).
* So, she needs 60 - 40 = 20 cups more.

"Let's break this down:

* **Step 1: Initial download time** 
   The file is 200 GB and she downloads at 2 GB/minute, so it would normally take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

* **Step 2: Download progress at the restart**
   The restart happens 40% of the way through, meaning she'd have downloaded 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes worth of data.

* **Step 3: Data downloaded before the restart**
   At 40 minutes, she's downloaded 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

* **Step 4: Remaining download time**
   She has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

* **Step 5: Total download time**
   The remaining download takes 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.  Adding the initial 40 minutes and the 20-minute restart, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **First leg:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    * He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    * He then drives 30 miles per hour for half an hour (0.5 hours), covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    * He has 4 hours for the return trip, but has already used 2.5 hours, leaving 1.5 hours.
    * In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.
    * The total distance covered on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

* **Final distance:**  Since he's traveling back towards home, we subtract the return trip distance from the initial trip distance: 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.



**Answer:** John is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18



**Answer:** Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Here's how to figure that out:

*  First, find out how many students chose contemporary dance: 20 students * 20% = 4 students.

*  That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.

*  Next, see how many of those students chose jazz: 16 students * 25% = 4 students.

*  Finally, subtract the jazz dancers from the remaining students to find the hip-hop dancers: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students.

*  To get the percentage of hip-hop dancers out of the total, divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of students and multiply by 100%: (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%

"Let's break this down.  

The sale price is 75% of the original price because a 25% discount means the book is selling for 100% - 25% = 75% of its original cost.

To find the original price, we can set up a simple equation:

0.75 * Original Price = $19.50

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.  This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.

Let's represent their ages with variables:

* Darrell's age = 7a
* Allen's age = 11a

We also know their total age is 162:

7a + 11a = 162

Combining like terms:

18a = 162

Now, solve for 'a':

a = 162 / 18 
a = 9

Now that we know 'a', we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's age = 11a = 11 * 9 = 99

* **Find the number of boys:**  Since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are 60 girls * 2 = 120 boys.
* **Find the total number of students:** There are 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.
* **Find the number of teachers:** There are 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.

"Okay, let's break down this beehive problem.  

We know there are 700 bees total, and the number of worker bees is double the number of baby bees, which is double the number of queens.  

Let's use a little algebra to figure this out:

* Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

We can set up the following equations:

* b = 2q 
* w = 2b
* q + b + w = 700

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

q + 2q + 2(2q) = 700

Simplifying:

q + 2q + 4q = 700
7q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7:

q = 100

Now we know there are 100 queen bees.  We can find the number of baby bees:

b = 2q = 2 * 100 = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:

w = 2b = 2 * 200 = 400

2. Simplify and solve for 'b':
   3b + 4 = 28
   3b = 24
   b = 8

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down.  

* There are 3 numbers on a standard six-sided die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number bigger than 3.

*  Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, think about it this way: you need to roll an even number first, then another even number.  There are 3 even numbers on the die (2, 4, and 6), so the chance of rolling one even number is 3 out of 6, or 1/2.  Since the die rolls are independent events (one roll doesn't affect the next), the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

*  Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

*  Converting that to a percentage, we get (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

"Let's figure this out!  We can use a little algebra to solve this chicken conundrum.

Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens and 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

We know:

*  Each red chicken lays 3 eggs, and each white chicken lays 5 eggs.
*  Together, they lay 42 eggs each day.
*  There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can set up two equations to represent this:

* Equation 1: 3r + 5w = 42  (Total eggs)
* Equation 2: w = r + 2   (Number of chickens)

Now, we can substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

"To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to figure out the total distance and then divide that by his walking speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we can find the perimeter (the total distance around the outside) by using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles)

Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles

Perimeter = 15 miles

Now we know the distance is 15 miles, and Gary walks at 3 miles per hour.  We can calculate the time:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour

Time = 5 hours

*  We know the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2*(s + 16) gallons.
* Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool. This means 2*(s + 16) - 16 = 4*(s).

"Let's break this down.  A redwood that tall would likely be quite massive.  

First, we need to figure out the total weight of the redwood before the termites got to it.  Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, and the tree is 200 feet tall, that means there are 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections).

"Okay, let's break this down.  

It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then another 40% of that time to reach 400 degrees.  That's an extra 8 minutes (20 * 0.40 = 8).  

So, heating the oil takes a total of 28 minutes (20 + 8).  

Cooking time is 5 minutes less than that, meaning it takes 23 minutes to cook.

Adding those together, the whole process takes 51 minutes.

Adding 10 to both sides:

"Let's break this down.  If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can represent this with an equation. Let 'c' be the number of cows.  Then, the number of chickens would be '2c'.  

We know the total number of animals is 60: c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60.

Since there are twice as many chickens, there are 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs.  

Total legs: (20 cows * 4 legs/cow) + (40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken) = 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Joanne's shortest tree apples:** Joanne picked half as many apples from the shortest trees as the tallest trees, so she picked 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

* **Joanne's total apples (tallest and shortest):**  Joanne picked a total of 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

* **Sister's apples:** The sister picked 60 apples from the tallest trees and 45 apples from the shortest trees, for a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Combined apples:** Together, they picked 500 apples, so Joanne must have picked 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

"Let's break this down.  We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of camels
*  Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries

* Equation 1: c + d = 180  (Total heads)
* Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (Total bumps)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'c':  c = 180 - d

2. Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. Simplify and solve for 'd': 360 - 2d + d = 304  =>  -d = -56  =>  d = 56

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down step-by-step:

*  Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects.

*  Combine like terms: (3/2)B + 7 = 43
*  Subtract 7 from both sides: (3/2)B = 36
*  Multiply both sides by 2/3: B = 24

So Bodhi found 24 insects.

Let 't' represent the age of one triplet.  Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the twin's age can be represented as 't + 7'.

The total age of all five children is 44, so we have the equation: t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

Simplifying the equation: 5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5: t = 6

Now that we know one triplet is 6 years old, we can find the age of one twin:

t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

"Let's break down John's vet bill:

* **Vaccines:** 2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

* **Heartworm Check:**  Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can represent the total bill as 'x'.  So, 0.60x = heartworm check cost.

* **Total Bill:** $40 (vaccines) + 0.60x (heartworm check) = x (total bill)

* **Solving for x:**
    *  0.60x = x - $40
    *  0 = 0.40x - $40
    *  $40 = 0.40x
    *  x = $100

"Let's break this Magic: The Gathering card problem down!

*  Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
*  Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
*  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7: x = 47

Now we can find Becca's cards: 3x + 12 = (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153


Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let your brother's age be 'b'
*  Let your sister's age be 's'
*  Let your age be 'y'

We know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1

Simplifying the last equation: 4b + y + s = 88

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Combining like terms: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

Now, substitute 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* Duncan is currently 60 years old, so eight years ago he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

*  We know that Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was twice Adam's age four years ago.  Let Adam's age four years ago be represented by 'x'.  We can set up the equation: 52 = 2x

* Solving for x, we find that Adam's age four years ago was x = 26.

*  Therefore, Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30 years old.

"Hey there!  Let's solve this age puzzle.

We know:

* Peter + Paul + John = 100 years
* Paul is 10 years older than John.
* Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Let's use a little algebra to figure this out.  

* Let John's age be ""J""
* Paul's age is ""J + 10""
* Peter's age is ""J + (J + 10)"" which simplifies to ""2J + 10""

Now we can plug these values into our first statement:

J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 20

Now that we know John is 20, we can find Peter's age:

Peter = 2J + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

It says the island had four times as many holes by the fourth day as it did at the end of the *first* day.  That doesn't make sense, because the number of holes at the end of the first day would be the same as the number of holes at the end of the first day!

"Let's break this problem down:

* Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
* Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey.

"Let's solve this Pokemon problem!

Let's use variables to keep track:

*  A = Alex's Pokemon count
*  S = Stan's Pokemon count
*  W = Adelwolfe's Pokemon count

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's)

Now we can use substitution to solve for S:

1.  Substitute (S + 5) for A and (4W - 13) for S in the first equation:
    (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3. Substitute (S + 13) / 4 for W:
    2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

4. Multiply both sides by 4:
    8S + S + 13 = 1336

5. Combine like terms:
    9S + 13 = 1336

6. Subtract 13 from both sides:
    9S = 1323

7. Divide both sides by 9:
    S = 147



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"Let's break down this bird's journey:

* **Leg 1:** South for 10 hours at 30 mph means the bird covers 30 * 10 = 300 miles.

* **Leg 2:** North for 2 hours at 18 mph means the bird covers 18 * 2 = 36 miles.

* **Leg 3:** South for 5 hours at 22 mph means the bird covers 22 * 5 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance south, we add the distances from Leg 1 and Leg 3: 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.

Finally, we subtract the northward distance to find the net distance south: 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

First, we need to figure out how many plants Pat needs.  She has 111 feet of flower bed and each plant needs 12 inches of space, plus 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant.  

So, the total space needed for plants is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot - 18 inches = 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

That means Pat needs 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since she can't have half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558 at the store.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**

* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**

* **Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the earnings from small stuffed animals are 2x * $4 = $8x.**

* **Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, or $4 * 3 = $12.**

* **Earnings from large stuffed animals are x * $12 = $12x.**

* **Her total earnings are $8x + $12x = $120.**

* **Combining like terms, we get $20x = $120.**

* **Dividing both sides by $20, we find x = 6.**

* **Teresa sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.**

* **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher** 
   *  There's a 50% chance Marcus has a substitute, and in that case, he definitely doesn't have to turn in the homework.

* **Scenario 2: Regular Teacher**
   * There's a 50% chance the regular teacher is there.
   * Of those times, there's a 40% chance she gives an extension.
   * That means there's a 60% chance she *doesn't* give an extension.

"Let's break this down using a bit of paleontological logic.  

We know the Allosaurus feasted on the last 270 kilograms. This represents half of what was left after the velociraptors had their share.  

So, before the Allosaurus got to it, there were 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg of meat remaining.

And that 540 kg was half of the original triceratops.  

Therefore, the original triceratops weighed 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg.

"To figure this out, we need to think about the total energy needs and how much each bottle covers.  

If one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, they'd need 5 bottles (100% / 20% = 5) to meet their full energy needs.

For 2300 people, that means they'd need 11,500 bottles in total (2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11,500 bottles).

Since Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles a day, they'd need to make 7300 more bottles to meet the demand (11,500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles).

"Here's how to solve this probability problem:

* **Identify the events:**

    * Event A: A baby is wearing purple.
    * Event B: A baby is wearing a bow.

* **Determine the probabilities:**

    * P(A) = 6/8 = 3/4 (probability of a baby wearing purple)
    * P(B|A) = 1/3 (probability of wearing a bow given they wear purple)
    * P(B| not A) = 1 (probability of wearing a bow given they don't wear purple)

* **Calculate the conditional probability:**

    * We want to find P(A|B), the probability a baby is wearing purple given they are wearing a bow.  We can use Bayes' Theorem:

    * P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

    * To find P(B), the probability of wearing a bow, we use the law of total probability:

    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B| not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (1/3) * (3/4) + 1 * (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2

* **Substitute and solve:**

    * P(A|B) = [(1/3) * (3/4)] / (1/2) = 1/2

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making it 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

We know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


**The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.**

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

* **Statement 1:** ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""  This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

* **Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""  This gives us: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**

"Let's solve this!  

If the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we can represent this with an equation:

* Let 'x' be the length of the shorter piece.
* The longer piece is 4x.

The total length of both pieces is 40 feet, so:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 8

The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.

"Let's break this down:

* A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.
* A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, so it has 0.50 * 36 = 18 more seeds.
*  That means a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.
*  In total, there are 36 + 54 = 90 sunflower seeds.

"Let's break this down.  

The company makes 5000 chocolate bars each day and sells them for $2 a piece.  Over two weeks (which is 14 days), they'd produce 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars.

Since each bar sells for $2, their total earnings would be 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000.

"Let's calculate Jake's total spending:

* **T-shirts:**  Since each T-shirt is 50% off, the second one costs half price. That's $8 / 2 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

* **Shoes:** A 40% discount on the shoes means Jake saves $40 * 0.40 = $16. The final price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

* **Total:**  Jake spends $12 on T-shirts + $24 on shoes = $36 in total.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out the total number of holes dug: 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Then, we calculate how many net holes Nate fills each day: 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.

Finally, we determine the number of days it takes to fill all the holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill all the holes.

"This is a classic example of a system of equations problem!  Here's how to solve it:

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can use substitution to solve for 'c'.  

1. Solve the first equation for 'w':
   w = 20 - c

2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. Simplify and solve for 'c':
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5
