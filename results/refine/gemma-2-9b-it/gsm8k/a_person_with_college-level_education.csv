"Here's how to calculate Josh's profit:

First, we need to determine the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 purchase price is calculated as:

1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000

This means the house's value after renovations is:

$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Next, we add the cost of repairs to find Josh's total investment:

$80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Finally, we subtract the total investment from the final house value to determine his profit:

$200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

* **Leg 1 (to his destination):** Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

* **Leg 2 (return trip):** 
    *  The first 2 hours are spent in traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
    *  The next 0.5 hours are spent driving at 30 mph: Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
    *  The remaining time for the return trip is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

"To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, Marissa needs to consider the time already spent and the remaining distance. 

She has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, which gives her an average speed of 3 miles per hour for that portion.  To reach the desired 4 mph average, she needs to cover the remaining 6 miles at a faster pace.

Let 'x' be the speed (in miles per hour) she needs to walk the remaining distance.  We can set up the following equation:

"Here's how to calculate the average square footage of each level:

* **Understanding the Geometric Series:** This problem involves a geometric series where each term is half the previous term.  

* **Formula:** The sum (S) of a finite geometric series is: S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)
    *  a = the first term (bottom level)
    *  r = the common ratio (0.5 in this case)
    *  n = the number of terms (4 levels)

* **Calculation:**
    *  We know the top level (a * r^(n-1)) is 16 square feet.  Let's find 'a':
        * 16 = a * (0.5)^(4-1)
        * 16 = a * 0.125
        * a = 128 square feet (bottom level)
    * Now, plug the values into the sum formula:
        * S = 128 (1 - 0.5^4) / (1 - 0.5)
        * S = 128 (1 - 0.0625) / 0.5
        * S = 128 * 0.9375 / 0.5
        * S = 240 square feet (total)

* **Average:**
    * Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels
    * Average = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

"Let's break down this beehive population problem:

We know there are 700 bees total, and the relationship between the types of bees is:

*  Worker bees = 2 * Baby bees
*  Baby bees = 2 * Queen bees

Let's use variables to represent the number of each type:

*  q = number of queen bees
*  b = number of baby bees
*  w = number of worker bees

We can express the total bee population as: q + b + w = 700

Now, substitute the relationships between the bee types into this equation:

q + 2q + 2(2q) = 700

Simplify and solve for q:

q + 2q + 4q = 700
7q = 700
q = 100

Now that we know there are 100 queen bees, we can find the number of baby bees:

b = 2q = 2 * 100 = 200

Finally, calculate the number of worker bees:

w = 2b = 2 * 200 = 400



**Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.**

"Let's break down this word problem step-by-step:

* Let Mark's current age be represented by the variable 'm'.
* Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 'm + 2'.

* Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.  We know Jan is 30, so:
    * Half of Jan's age is 30 / 2 = 15
    * Mark's age two years ago was 15 + 5 = 20

* Since Mark's age two years ago was 20, his current age is 20 + 2 = 22.

Now, the big pool contains 2x - 16 gallons, and the small pool contains x - 16 gallons.  We're told the big pool now has four times the amount of water as the small pool:

* **Step 1: Find the number of students who like blue.** 
   Half the class likes blue, so there are 40 students / 2 = 20 students who like blue.

* **Step 2: Find the number of students who don't like blue.**
   This is the total number of students minus those who like blue: 40 students - 20 students = 20 students.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

We can represent the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have as  5x and 6x, respectively, where x is a constant.  We know that the sum of their popsicles is 165, so:

5x + 6x = 165

Combining like terms, we get:

x = 15

Therefore, Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles, and Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

The difference in the number of popsicles Sam has compared to Betty is 90 - 75 = 15.

We are given the following information:

*  *c + d = 180*  (The total number of heads)
*  *2c + d = 304* (The total number of humps)

We can solve for *d* (the number of dromedaries) using substitution or elimination.  Let's use elimination:

1. Multiply the first equation by -1:

* **Savings Breakdown:** Cole saved a total of $6.  Let 'x' represent the amount saved on the tattered jeans.  Since he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, the savings on the jogger jeans is (1/3)*$6 = $2. This means he saved $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans.

* **Original Jogger Jeans Price:** The jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $2 = $24.

* **Price Difference:** The jogger jeans originally cost $24 - $28 = -$4 more than the tattered jeans.

Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we know the horse eats 1/2 a bale of hay for every mile run.  Therefore, over 16 miles, it consumes:

Hay consumption = 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales

Each bale of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a system of equations.

Let:

*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We are given the following information:

"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should prioritize purchasing the lumber that yields the highest stick count per dollar.  

* A 2x4 yields 200 sticks for $4, resulting in a stick-to-dollar ratio of 50 sticks per dollar (200 sticks / $4).
* A 2x8 yields 400 sticks for $6, resulting in a stick-to-dollar ratio of 66.67 sticks per dollar (400 sticks / $6).

Since the 2x8 offers a better stick-to-dollar ratio, Frederick should purchase as many 2x8s as his budget allows.  With $24, he can buy 4 2x8s ( $24 / $6 per 2x8 = 4 2x8s).

"To determine Elvis's required daily savings in the second half of April, we can set up a simple algebraic equation.

Let 'x' represent Elvis's daily savings in the first half of April.  Since he aims to save twice as much each day in the second half, his daily savings in the second half would be 2x.

His total savings for the month must equal his target of $1125.  Therefore:

"Let's break down this word problem step-by-step:

* **Define the variables:** 
    * Let 'J' represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
    * Let 'S' represent the size of James's play set (which is 80 toys).

* **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
    * Jonathan wants a play set five times larger than James's: 5 * S = 400 toys
    * Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach his desired set size: J + 2 = 400

* **Solve for J:**
    *  We already know S = 80, so 5 * 80 = 400.
    *  Therefore, J + 2 = 400
    *  Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get J = 398.

"Here's how to determine the tire lifespan:

First, we need to calculate the total rotations the tires undergo per year:

* Rotations per mile: 725
* Miles driven per year: 400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles
* Total rotations per year: 4800 miles * 725 rotations/mile = 3,480,000 rotations/year

Next, we divide the tire's maximum rotations by the annual rotations to find the lifespan:

* Lifespan (years): 10,440,000 rotations / 3,480,000 rotations/year = 3 years

"Here's how to solve the problem:

First, we need to determine the cost per washing.  Since the jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings, each washing costs $24.00 / 120 washings = $0.20 per washing.

Next, we know that Jackie uses 1 pump per washing.  Therefore, the cost per pump is $0.20 per washing * 1 pump/washing = $0.20 per pump.

Finally, we convert this to cents: $0.20 is equal to 20 cents.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the increasing funding each month.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Initial Funding:** $100,000 for the first 5 months.
* **Funding Increase:**  A 50% increase each month after the initial 5 months.

Let's represent the funding for each month as a sequence:

* Month 1-5: $100,000
* Month 6: $100,000 * 1.50 = $150,000
* Month 7: $150,000 * 1.50 = $225,000
* ... and so on for the remaining months.

This represents a geometric sequence.  The sum of a finite geometric series is:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term ($100,000)
* r = the common ratio (1.50)
* n = the number of terms (50 months)

Plugging in these values, we can calculate the total cost of the research.

    * S = M + 23
    * We know K = 68

* **Solve for M (Max's cookies):**

    * Add 5 to both sides: M = 73

* **Solve for C (Cookie Monster's cookies):**
    * Substitute M = 73 into the second equation: 73 = C + 12
    * Subtract 12 from both sides: C = 61

* **Solve for S (Summer's cookies):**

"Let's break down this problem:

We have two scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
* **Scenario 2:** The combined age of all five children (two twins and three triplets) is 44.

Let's use variables to represent the ages:

*  Let 't' represent the age of one triplet.
*  Let 'tw' represent the age of one twin.

We can express these scenarios as equations:

*  tw = t + 7 
*  tw + tw + t + t + t = 44

Now, we can solve for 't' (the age of one triplet):

1. Substitute the first equation (tw = t + 7) into the second equation:
   (t + 7) + (t + 7) + t + t + t = 44

2. Simplify the equation:
   5t + 14 = 44

3. Subtract 14 from both sides:
   5t = 30

4. Divide both sides by 5:
   t = 6

Finally, substitute the value of 't' back into the equation tw = t + 7 to find the age of one twin:

* tw = 6 + 7
* tw = 13



**Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.**

Let's denote the cost of one candy as 'c'. We know that 5 lollipops at $0.40 each cost $2.00, and the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20.  This can be represented as:

* 5 * $0.40 + 4c = $3.20

Simplifying the equation:

* $2.00 + 4c = $3.20

Subtracting $2.00 from both sides:

* 4c = $1.20

Dividing both sides by 4:

* c = $0.30

Therefore, the cost of one candy is $0.30.

To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

* 10 * $0.40 + 10 * $0.30 = $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

Next, we calculate their annual savings:

* Rong: 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year
* Neil: 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins/year

Finally, we find their total savings after ten years:

* Rong: 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins
* Neil: 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins

Their combined savings after ten years are 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

*  Equation 2: o = 2w (The ratio of orange to white fish)

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

w + 2w = 17

Combining like terms:

3w = 17

Solving for 'w':

w = 17/3 

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, this problem doesn't have a realistic solution within the given parameters.  It's likely there's an error in the problem statement.

"To determine Andy's weekly fuel cost, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weekly mileage:**  Since Andy drives 5 miles one way to work and back, his daily round trip is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.  Over a five-day work week, this totals 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles.

2. **Calculate the gallons of gas consumed:**  With his car's fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG), Andy uses 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas per week.

3. **Calculate the total weekly cost:** At a gas price of $3 per gallon, Andy spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 per week on fuel.

"Here's how to determine the total money spent at the arcade:

First, we need to figure out how long each friend plays. Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. Two friends play half as long, meaning they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. The better friend plays 1.5 times longer than Jack, so they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

Since they play for 4 hours, or 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes total, we can calculate the number of quarters each friend uses:

* Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* Weaker friends: 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters
* Better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters

Adding up the quarters used by all friends, we get 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Finally, multiplying the total quarters by the price per quarter ($0.25) gives us the total money spent: 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

Let 'z' represent the number of ounces of citrus zest (and fragrance, as they are used in equal amounts).  Since the salt and sugar quantities are also equal, let 's' represent the number of ounces of both.  Finally, the oil amount is twice the salt amount, so oil is 2s ounces.

We know the total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces, so we can set up the equation:

z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Simplifying:

2z + 4s = 10

Since z = s, we can substitute:

2s + 4s = 10

Combining like terms:

6s = 10

Solving for s:

s = 10/6 = 5/3 ounces

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 2s = 2 * (5/3) = 10/3 ounces.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let's denote:

*  'k' as the speed of one kangaroo
*  't' as the speed of one turtle

We know:

*  Time = Distance / Speed

Since the distance traveled by all animals is the same, we can set up the following relationships:

*  Time taken by 3 kangaroos = 18 hours  
*  Time taken by one kangaroo = 18 hours * 3 = 54 hours
*  Speed of one turtle = k / 2
*  Time taken by one turtle = Distance / (k/2) = 2 * Distance / k

Therefore, time taken by four turtles = 4 * (2 * Distance / k) = 8 * Distance / k

We also know that time taken by one kangaroo = Distance / k = 54 hours.

Time taken by four turtles = 8 * Distance / k = 8 * 54 hours = 432 hours

"To increase milk production to 25 liters per day, the farmer needs to determine the additional milk production required and then calculate the number of cows needed to achieve that increase. 

Currently, the farmer produces 15 liters per day (5 liters/cow * 3 cows).  

Therefore, he needs an additional 10 liters per day (25 liters - 15 liters).

Assuming each cow produces 5 liters per day, he would need to add 2 more cows (10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows).

"Brenda's investment will grow using the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

Where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years

In this case:

* P = $300
* r = 0.75 (three-quarters is equivalent to 0.75 as a decimal)
* t = 3 years

Plugging these values into the formula:

A = $300 (1 + 0.75 * 3)

"Let's break down this age word problem step-by-step using a system of equations.

*  Let 'b' represent your brother's age.
*  Let 's' represent your sister's age.
*  Let 'y' represent your age.

We are given the following information:

*  y = b - 3  (You are three years younger than your brother)
*  y = s + 2  (You are two years older than your sister)
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87 (The sum of all ages is 87)

Simplifying the last equation: 4b + y + s = 88

Substituting the first two equations into the simplified last equation: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Combining like terms: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

Substituting 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

"Let's break down this word problem step-by-step:

* Let Duncan's current age be represented by 'd' and Adam's current age by 'a'.

* We know that eight years ago, Duncan's age was twice Adam's age four years ago.  This can be expressed as:  d - 8 = 2(a - 4)

* We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60: d = 60

* Now we can substitute '60' for 'd' in the first equation: 60 - 8 = 2(a - 4)

* Simplifying the equation: 52 = 2a - 8

* Adding 8 to both sides: 60 = 2a

* Dividing both sides by 2: a = 30

* Therefore, Adam is currently 30 years old.

* To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38



**Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.**

"To determine the total watch time, we can use the following calculation:

Total watch time = Number of episodes * Length of each episode

Given that there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, we can express the number of episodes as 20 minutes / episode / 2 = 10 episodes.

Therefore, the total watch time is 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes.

*  T<sub>f</sub> as the final temperature

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.  The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is off.

* **Low setting:** The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

"To determine the percentage of watermelon each adult receives, we can set up a simple proportion. 

Let 'x' represent the size of one child's slice.  Since each adult receives a slice twice as large as a child's, an adult's slice is 2x.  

The total watermelon is divided into 6 slices: 4 slices for the children (4x) and 2 slices for the adults (2 * 2x).

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the initial charge of the power bank.

*  After the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, resulting in a loss of 0.09 * 5 = 0.45x.  The remaining charge is then x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

*  Over the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour, leading to a loss of 0.07 * 3 = 0.21x.

*  The final charge is 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x. We know this final charge is 28% of the original capacity, so 0.34x = 0.28.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
    * Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

* **Set up the equations:**
    * The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
    * The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, or $4 * 3 = $12.
    * Total earnings from small stuffed animals: 2x * $4 = $8x
    * Total earnings from large stuffed animals: x * $12 = $12x
    * Total earnings: $8x + $12x = $120

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: $20x = $120
    * Divide both sides by $20: x = 6

* **Calculate the number of small stuffed animals sold:**
    * 2x = 2 * 6 = 12

"Here's the breakdown of the dwarven ore mining calculation:

* **Base Output:** A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with bare hands.
* **Iron Pickaxe Output:** An iron pickaxe doubles the output to 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
* **Steel Pickaxe Output:** A steel pickaxe increases output by 50% of the iron pickaxe output, which is 0.50 * 24 = 12 pounds.  This brings the total to 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.
* **Collective Output:** With 40 dwarves using steel pickaxes, the daily output is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.
* **Monthly Output:** Over a 30-day month, they mine 1440 * 30 = 43,200 pounds of ore.



**Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine 43,200 pounds of ore in a month.**

"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we can use the concept of complementary probability.  

Let's define the events:

*  A: Marcus has to turn in his homework.
*  B: Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

We know:

* P(A') = 1 - P(A)  (Probability of the complement of an event is 1 minus the probability of the event)

We can break down the probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework (B) into the following scenarios:

* Substitute teacher: P(Substitute) = 0.50
* Normal teacher with extension: P(Normal Teacher & Extension) = 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20
* Normal teacher without extension and no dog excuse: P(Normal Teacher & No Extension & No Dog Excuse) = 0.50 * (1 - 0.40) * (1 - 0.20) = 0.24

Therefore:

P(B) = P(Substitute) + P(Normal Teacher & Extension) + P(Normal Teacher & No Extension & No Dog Excuse) = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.24 = 0.94

"Here's how to determine the discount percentage:

First, we need to find the selling price as a proportion of the original price.  Mr. Rogers bought the watch for 75% of the original price, and then sold it for 120% of his purchase price.  

*  Selling price = 120% of 75% of $2000 = 1.20 * 0.75 * $2000 = $1800

*  Discount = Original Price - Selling Price = $2000 - $1800 = $200

*  Discount Percentage = (Discount / Original Price) * 100% = ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we can set up a simple algebraic equation.

Let 'x' represent the length of fence Sam receives.  Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry receives 'x + 60' feet.  

The total fence length is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 20

Therefore, Sam receives 20 feet of fence.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

* **Define Variables:**

   * Let 'v<sub>b</sub>' represent Grandma's speed on the beach (miles per minute).
   * Let 'v<sub>s</sub>' represent Grandma's speed on the sidewalk (miles per minute).

* **Set Up Equations:**

   * We know v<sub>s</sub> = 2v<sub>b</sub> (Grandma walks twice as fast on the sidewalk).
   * We also know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, so v<sub>b</sub> = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

* **Calculate Sidewalk Time:**

   *  Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of v<sub>s</sub> = 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

* **Find Total Time:**

   * The total walk time is 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.

* **Define the variable:** Let 'x' represent the initial number of marbles Bob has.

* **Set up the equations:**
    *  The problem states that if Bob receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he'll have 60 marbles. This can be written as: x + 24 = 60
    *  After losing 10 marbles, he'll have 'y' marbles, where y = x - 10

* **Solve for x:**
    *  Subtract 24 from both sides of the first equation: x = 60 - 24 = 36

* **Solve for y:**
    * Substitute the value of x (36) into the second equation: y = 36 - 10 = 26

    * P(B|¬P) = 1 (probability of wearing a bow given they are not wearing purple)

* **Calculate the Probability:**

We want to find P(P|B), the probability a baby is wearing purple given they are wearing a bow.  We can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(P|B) = [P(B|P) * P(P)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of wearing a bow, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|P) * P(P)  +  P(B|¬P) * P(¬P)
P(B) = (1/3) * (3/4) + 1 * (1/4) 
P(B) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(P|B) = [(1/3) * (3/4)] / (1/2)
P(P|B) = 1/2 * 2
P(P|B) = 1

* **Convert to Percentage:**

P(P|B) = 1 = 100%

Let's use variables to represent the lengths:

*  Let  'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.

"Let's break down this word problem:

We know John is currently 28 years old.  We also know that when Digimon premiered, John was twice Jim's age.  To find Jim's current age, we can use the following logic:

*  Let Jim's current age be represented by the variable 'x'.
*  Since John was twice Jim's age when Digimon premiered, we can say that John's age at that time was 2x.
*  The difference in their ages remains constant. This means John's current age (28) is equal to his age at the premiere of Digimon (2x) plus the number of years that have passed since then.

We can express this mathematically as: 28 = 2x +  *number of years since Digimon premiered*

Unfortunately, we don't know the exact number of years since Digimon premiered.  

**Without that information, we cannot determine Jim's current age (x).**

"Let's denote the number of strawberry ice cubes as 's'.  The problem states that Mary makes a number of blueberry ice cubes equal to five times the number of strawberry cubes minus four.  We can express this mathematically as 5s - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Dividing both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know Mary made 20 strawberry ice cubes, we can find the number of blueberry ice cubes:

Blueberry ice cubes = 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

To find the total amount raised, we add up the contributions of each girl: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Define variables:**
    * Let  'v' represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
    * Let 'a' represent Aaron's speed in miles per minute.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa: a = 2v
    * We know Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron:  Vanessa's distance = 2 * Aaron's distance
    * We know Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes: a = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute

* **Solve for Vanessa's speed:**
    * Substitute the value of 'a' from the third equation into the first equation: 0.125 = 2v
    * Solve for 'v': v = 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute

* **Calculate Vanessa's time:**
    * Vanessa's time = Vanessa's distance / Vanessa's speed 
    * Vanessa's time = 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes



**Answer:** Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part.

"Here's how to determine the selling price per watermelon:

First, we need to calculate the profit amount:

* Profit = (Profit Percentage / 100) * Cost Price
* Profit = (25 / 100) * $80 = $20

Next, we find the total selling price:

* Total Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
* Total Selling Price = $80 + $20 = $100

Finally, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons to find the selling price per watermelon:

* Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons
* Selling Price per Watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Dora's current age:** Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
* **James's current age:** James is twice Dora's age, making him 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's youngest son's current age:** John was 32 when his youngest son was born, and he is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.  Therefore, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
* **John's youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, his youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, meaning her peeling rate is 1/3 oranges per minute.  Jane peels an orange every 4 minutes, giving her a peeling rate of 1/4 oranges per minute.

Over an hour (60 minutes), Ana would peel (1/3 oranges/minute) * (60 minutes) = 20 oranges.

Similarly, Jane would peel (1/4 oranges/minute) * (60 minutes) = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled is 20 - 15 = 5.

"Here's the breakdown of Mark's expenses:

* **Radiator cost:** The radiator's original price was $400, but he got it for 80% off, meaning he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320.  
* **Radiator price after discount:**  His final cost for the radiator was $400 - $320 = $80.
* **Mechanic labor:** The mechanic charged $50 per hour for 3 hours of work, totaling $50 * 3 = $150.
* **Total cost:**  Adding the radiator cost and labor, Mark paid a total of $80 + $150 = $230.

"This is a classic example of a system of equations problem.  We can solve for the number of chickens using the following steps:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let  'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* We know that the total number of animals is 20:  c + w = 20
* We also know that the total number of legs is 70: 2c + 4w = 70 (chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**3. Solve for 'c':**

One way to solve this is using substitution.  Solve the first equation for 'w':
w = 20 - c

Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':
2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5



**Answer:** There are **5** chickens.
