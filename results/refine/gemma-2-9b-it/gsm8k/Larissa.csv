"Okay, let's break down this house flipping scenario. 

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value went up by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal.  

Here's how I figured that out:

* Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
* With 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed total.
* She's already given out 40 cups (15 + 25).
* So, she needs 60 - 40 = 20 cups more.

"Let's break this down!  Kylar's buying glasses in a pattern:

*  He pays $5 for the first glass.
*  Every other glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.

So, he'll pay $5, then $3, then $5, then $3, and so on.  

Since he's buying 16 glasses, he'll have 8 pairs of glasses at this alternating price.

Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

The total cost for all 16 glasses is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

* **Step 1: Initial download time** 
   Carla would normally download the entire 200 GB file at 2 GB/minute, taking 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

* **Step 2: Download progress at the restart**
   The restart happens 40% of the way through, so that's 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes.

* **Step 3: Data downloaded before the restart**
   In those 40 minutes, she downloads 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

* **Step 4: Remaining download time**
   She has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

* **Step 5: Total download time**
   The remaining download takes 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

* **Step 6: Final calculation**
   Adding the initial download time, the restart time, and the remaining download time, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **First leg:** John drives 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    * He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    * He then drives 30 miles per hour for half an hour (0.5 hours), covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    * He has 4 hours for the return trip, but has already used 2.5 hours, leaving 1.5 hours.
    * In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.
    * The total distance covered on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

* **Final distance:**  Since he drove 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18



**Answer:** Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

*  So, 12 students must have chosen hip-hop!

*  Finally, to find the percentage of the whole class who chose hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100%: (12/20) * 100% = 60%

If the book is selling for $19.50 after a 25% discount, that means $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).

To find the original price, we can set up a proportion:

75/100 = $19.50 / x

Where 'x' is the original price.

Solving for x, we get:

x = ($19.50 * 100) / 75 
x = $26.00

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

If their total age is 162, we can set up an equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms:

18x = 162

Now, solve for x:

x = 162 / 18 
x = 9

This means Darrell is currently 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, simply add 10:

"Let's figure this out!  

If Gretchen has 110 coins total and 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation. Let 's' represent the number of silver coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins, we know there are 's + 30' gold coins.  

Together, they equal 110:  s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms: 2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: s = 40

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It sounds like we have a classic beehive population problem.  Here's how to break it down:

* **Queens:**  We know there are twice as many babies as queens, and twice as many workers as babies.  
* **Babies:**  Let's say there are 'q' queens. That means there are 2q baby bees.
* **Workers:**  With twice as many workers as babies, we have 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

* **Total:**  All together, we have q + 2q + 4q = 700 bees.

* **Simplify:**  That means 7q = 700

* **Solve for q:**  Divide both sides by 7, and we find q = 100 queens.

* **Calculate Workers:** Since we have 4q workers, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

* Milk: $2
* Eggs: $3
* Light bulbs: $3
* Cups: $3

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Start with Dave:** Dave ate 14 fries.
* **Seagull's snack:** The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* **Fries remaining:**  After the seagull, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.
* **Pigeon party:**  Each pigeon ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* **Fries after pigeons:**  This is where things get tricky!  Since the pigeons ate 9 fries and there were only 7 left, this means there weren't enough fries for all the pigeons.  

Because the problem states that the pigeons bullied the seagull away, it implies that the seagull had eaten some fries before the pigeons arrived.  

Let's adjust our thinking:

* **Rethinking the pigeons:**  The pigeons must have eaten some fries that were already on the ground, not all 9 from the original pack.

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to figure out the exact number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

"Let's break this down.  We're dealing with exponential growth here since the price increases by a percentage of the *current* price each time.

The price starts at $20 and increases by 20% every two months.  This means the price is multiplied by 1.20 every two months.

To find the price after 36 months, we can use the formula:

*Final Price = Initial Price * (Growth Factor) ^ (Number of Periods)*

In this case:

* Initial Price = $20
* Growth Factor = 1.20
* Number of Periods = 36 months / 2 months/period = 18 periods

So, the final price is:

$20 * (1.20)^18 = $20 * 10.062656 = $201.25 (approximately)

   (2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

2. Simplify and solve for 'b':
   3b + 4 = 28
   3b = 24
   b = 8

3. Substitute the value of 'b' (8) back into the equation s = 2b:

"Let's break this down!

There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a standard six-sided die (4, 5, and 6).  That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number greater than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider each roll separately. There are 3 even numbers on the die (2, 4, and 6), so the chance of rolling one even number is 3 out of 6, or 1/2.  Since each roll is independent, we multiply those probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Converting that to a percentage, we get (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

"To figure this out, we need to think about how averages work.  Brinley wants an average of 93 across six tests.  That means her total score across all six tests needs to be 93 * 6 = 558.

She's already scored 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 on the first five tests.  

So, she needs to score 558 - 438 = 120 on the sixth test.

"Let's break down Micheal's biking journey:

* **Phase 1:** He rode 25 kilometers per ride, 5 times a week for 4 weeks.  That's 25 km/ride * 5 rides/week = 125 km per week.  Over four weeks, he covered 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

* **Phase 2:**  He switched to 2 rides a week, each covering 60 kilometers, for 3 weeks.  That's 60 km/ride * 2 rides/week = 120 km per week.  Over three weeks, he covered 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

* **Total Distance:** Adding both phases, Micheal biked a total of 500 km + 360 km = 860 km.

"Let's break this down.  We know half a dozen plates cost $36,000 (6 plates * $6,000/plate).  Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that, so they cost $34,800 ($36,000 - $1200).

"Let's figure this out!  We can use a little algebra to solve this chicken conundrum.

Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens and 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

We know:

*  Each red chicken lays 3 eggs, and each white chicken lays 5 eggs.
*  Together, they lay 42 eggs each day.
*  There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can write this as a system of equations:

*  Equation 1: 3r + 5w = 42 
*  Equation 2: w = r + 2

Now, let's solve for 'r'.  We can substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

"To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to figure out the total distance and then divide that by his walking speed.  

The park is a rectangle, so we can find the perimeter (the total distance around the outside) by using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now we know the distance is 15 miles, and Gary walks at 3 miles per hour.  

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool has now.

* Since the pools leak at 4 gallons per minute,  4 minutes ago, the small pool had 's + 16' gallons.

*  We know the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2*(s + 16) gallons.

* Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool. This means: 2*(s + 16) - 16 = 4*(s)

* Simplifying the equation: 2s + 32 - 16 = 4s
* Combining like terms: 16 = 2s
* Solving for 's': s = 8


**Answer:** The small pool has 8 gallons now.

First, we need to figure out how many water-type cards James has left after losing some. He started with 40 and lost 8, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards.

Next, we need to know the total number of cards James has now. He has 30 fire, 34 grass, and 32 water cards, for a total of 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards.

Finally, to find the percentage chance of picking a water-type card, we divide the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100%: (32 / 96) * 100% = 33.33%.

Rounding that to the nearest integer, the chance of picking a water-type card is 33%.

* In nine years, Ruby will be 6S + 9 years old.

We know that in nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam.  This can be written as an equation:

Now we can solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6

"Let's break this problem down.  

If we let 'x' represent the size of the two equal groups, we know:

* x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

* 3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

* 3x = 210

Finally, dividing both sides by 3:

* x = 70

Since the smallest group is 10 less than the other two, it has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Let's break this down!  

* **Step 1: Find the number of each animal.**

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can use variables to represent them:

* Let 'c' be the number of cows.
* Chickens are twice the number of cows, so there are '2c' chickens.

We know the total number of animals is 60:

* c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms:

* 3c = 60

Dividing both sides by 3:

* c = 20 cows

Now we can find the number of chickens:

* 2 * 20 = 40 chickens

* **Step 2: Calculate the total number of legs.**

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Finally, add the legs from both animals: 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Let's break this down.  We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of camels
*  Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries

* Equation 1: c + d = 180 (total heads)
* Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (total bumps)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'c':  c = 180 - d

2. Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. Simplify and solve for 'd': 360 - 2d + d = 304  =>  -d = -56  =>  d = 56



**Answer:** There are 56 dromedaries.

First, remember that there are 3 feet in every yard. So, Billie's room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet long.

We know the area of a rectangle is length times width:  Area = length * width.  We're given the area (360 square feet) and the length (9 feet), so we can solve for the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet * width
width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down!

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily was a bit of a bug-hunting superstar and found 7 more than David.
*  David, on the other hand, found half the number of insects Bodhi did.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's say:

*  B = the number of insects Bodhi found
*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We can write these equations based on the information given:

*  L + D + B = 43 
*  L = D + 7
*  D = B / 2

Now, we can use substitution to solve for L (the number of insects Lily found).  Let's substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplify that a bit:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Divide both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can plug that back into the equation L = D + 7:

L = 9 + 7

So, Lily found 16 insects!

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since he wants to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month compared to the first half, we can set up an equation to represent this.

Let 'x' be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.  

* Savings in the first half: 15x

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

It sounds like we're dealing with a series of operations applied to a number.  

1. **Starting Point:** Diane begins with a value of 20.

2. **Adding Half:**  We need to add half of the number to 20. Let's represent the unknown number as ""x"". So, half of the number is x/2, and the sum is 20 + x/2.

3. **Division:** This sum is then divided by 5: (20 + x/2) / 5

4. **Multiplication:** Finally, the result is multiplied by the starting value (20) minus 12: [(20 + x/2) / 5] * (20 - 12)

5. **Simplifying:** This simplifies to [(20 + x/2) / 5] * 8

6. **Final Expression:**  The final expression representing the value of the number train is (160 + 4x) / 5. 



To get a numerical answer, we'd need to know the value of 'x'.

"Okay, let's break down John's research costs.  

This is a classic example of exponential growth.  Since the funding increases by 50% each month after the initial 5 months, we can use a formula to calculate the total cost.  

Here's how it works:

* **Months 1-5:**  $100,000 per month * 5 months = $500,000
* **Months 6-50:** We need to calculate the funding for each of these months and sum them.

The formula for this type of growth is:

* **Future Value = Present Value * (1 + Growth Rate)^Number of Periods**

In this case:

* Present Value = $100,000 (funding after the first 5 months)
* Growth Rate = 0.50 (50%)
* Number of Periods = 45 (months 6-50)

You'd plug these values into the formula to get the funding for each month, then sum them up along with the initial $500,000.  

Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the full calculation!

*  There are 9 people in total (Jack plus 8 adults).
*  Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, so the 8 adults weigh 8 * 80 = 640 kg.
*  The total weight of everyone in the elevator is 640 kg + 80 kg (Jack) = 720 kg.
*  They've exceeded the elevator's limit by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

"Let's break this down.  We know the final length of the dress is 140cm, and that includes a 50% extension and a 20cm lace trim.  

*  Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.

*  The extension adds 0.50x to the original length.

*  So, the total length before the trim is x + 0.50x = 1.50x

*  Adding the trim brings the total to 1.50x + 20cm = 140cm

*  Let 't' represent the age of one triplet.
*  Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the twin's age is 't + 7'.

*  The total age of all five children is 44, so we have the equation: t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

*  Simplifying the equation: 5t + 14 = 44

*  Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5t = 30

*  Dividing both sides by 5: t = 6

*  Now that we know one triplet is 6, we can find the age of one twin: 6 + 7 = 13

"Let's break this piggy bank problem down!

First, we need to figure out how many coins Neil saves each month. He saves 2/5 more than Rong's 20 coins, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins.  

That means Neil saves a total of 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's see how many coins they save each year:

* Rong: 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year
* Neil: 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins/year

Over ten years, their savings add up to:

* Rong: 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins
* Neil: 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins

Finally, their combined savings are 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Let's break down John's vet bill:

* **Vaccines:** 2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

* **Heartworm Check:**  Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can represent the total bill as 'x'.  So, 0.60x = heartworm check cost.

* **Total Bill:** $40 (vaccines) + 0.60x (heartworm check) = x (total bill)

* **Solving for x:**
    * Subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40
    * Subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40
    * Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x
    * Divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100

* **Change:** $125 (initial amount) - $100 (total bill) = $25

* **Apples:** 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* **Oranges:** 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

* **Total quarters:**  Adding up everyone's quarters, we get 12 + (24 * 2) + 8 = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

* **Total cost:**  With each quarter worth $0.25, the total cost is 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00

"Let's break down this salt scrub recipe!  

*  We know Tanya uses equal amounts of citrus zest and fragrance, and equal amounts of salt and sugar.  
*  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say 'x' represents the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance). Since salt and sugar are equal, they're also 'x' ounces.  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so that's 2x ounces.

To find out how much of each ingredient she uses, we need to figure out the value of 'x'.  We know the total amount in the jar is 10 ounces:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms: 5x = 10

Dividing both sides by 5: x = 2

Now we can find out how much oil she uses: 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Combine like terms:

"Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left. 

First, the chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.  

Then, the total cost of the chicken is 6 packs * $4/pack = $24.

The strawberries cost $4 each, so 3 packs cost 3 * $4 = $12.

And the apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.  

That means 7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.

Adding up all the costs, we get $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, subtracting her spending from her budget, Kelly has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"Let's break this down.  Elaina's final concert was twice the length of her usual shows, plus a 15-minute encore.  We know the final concert was 65 minutes long.  

To find the length of her regular concerts, we can set up an equation:

* Let 'x' represent the length of her usual concerts.

* Twice the length of a usual concert is 2x.

*  The equation is: 2x + 15 = 65

* Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 50

* Divide both sides by 2: x = 25

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Let Peter's age be represented by 'P', Paul's age by 'Pa', and John's age by 'J'.

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

We can use substitution to find Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. Substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50

*  Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Bahati, so Dinar scored x + 20 - 10 = x + 10 points.

*  The total points scored by the team is 45, so we have the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

*  Simplifying the equation: 3x + 30 = 45

*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

*  Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5


**Answer:** Azibo scored 5 points.

"Let's break this down.  

The hospital starts with 20% of its beds occupied (1/5 of 1000 beds). That means there are 800 unoccupied beds initially.

With 50 new admissions each day for two weeks (14 days), a total of 700 new patients are admitted (50 * 14 = 700).

Adding those new patients to the existing occupied beds, we have a total of 900 occupied beds (200 + 700 = 900).

Therefore, there are 100 unoccupied beds left (1000 - 900 = 100).

"Ahoy there, matey!  Let's break down this treasure hunt puzzle.

It says the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.  That means we need to figure out how many holes were there after day one first.

*  They dug 10 holes on day one.

*  They dug 13 more on day two, and 8 more on day three.

*  That's a total of 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes dug.

*  They filled in 2 holes, so there were 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

*  If there were four times as many holes at the end of day four, that means there were 29 x 4 = 116 holes at the end of day four.

*  To find out how many they dug on day four, we need to subtract the holes from the first three days: 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

"Let's figure this out!  

* Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find out how many Pokemon Stan caught (S), we can use substitution:

1.  Since A = S + 5, we can substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
    (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3.  We also know S = 4W - 13.  Let's substitute that into the simplified equation:
    2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

4. Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
    8S + S + 13 = 1336

5. Combine like terms:
    9S + 13 = 1336

6. Subtract 13 from both sides:
    9S = 1323

7. Divide both sides by 9:
    S = 147



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"Let's break down this water tank problem step-by-step:

* **Day 1:** Wanda pumps 1/4 of the tank, which is (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.  Ms. B pumps 3/4 of what Wanda pumps, so she fills (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

* **Day 2:** Wanda pumps 2/3 of her Day 1 amount: (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of her Day 1 amount: (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.

* **Total Pumped:** Over the two days, they pump a total of 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

* **Remaining:**  Since the tank holds 18000 gallons, there are 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons left to fill.




**Answer:** 6000 gallons

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the power bank ended up with 28% charge after losing a certain amount.  

*  It lost 9% for 5 hours, which is a total of 45% lost (9 * 5 = 45).
*  Then it lost another 7% for 3 hours, totaling 21% lost (7 * 3 = 21).

So, the power bank lost a total of 66% (45 + 21 = 66).

To find the original charge, we can set up an equation:

Original Charge - 66% = 28%

Let 'x' represent the original charge.  Solving for x:

x - 0.66x = 0.28
0.34x = 0.28
x = 0.28 / 0.34 
x ≈ 0.82 or 82%

* **Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the earnings from small stuffed animals are 2x * $4 = $8x.**

* **Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, or $4 * 3 = $12.**

* **The earnings from large stuffed animals are x * $12 = $12x.**

* **Teresa's total earnings are $8x + $12x = $120.**

* **Scenario 2: Regular Teacher**
   * There's a 40% chance the regular teacher gives an extension.

* **Scenario 3: Dog Ate My Homework**
   * Even if there's no extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher.

To find the probability Marcus *has* to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he *doesn't* get out of it:

"Here's how to solve this problem:

First, find the sale price: 75% of $2000 is (0.75) * $2000 = $1500.

Then, calculate the selling price: 120% of $1500 is (1.20) * $1500 = $1800.

Finally, determine the discount: $2000 - $1800 = $200.

To express the discount as a percentage of the original price, divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.

"Let's break this down like we're examining a fossil!

We know the Allosaurus feasted on the last 270 kilograms.  Before that, the velociraptors had their share, which was half of what was left after the T-Rex.  

Think of it this way: if the Allosaurus ate the final piece, the velociraptors must have eaten a piece that was twice as big.  So, the amount the velociraptors ate plus the Allosaurus's share equals half of the original triceratops.

Let 'x' represent the original weight of the triceratops.  We can set up an equation:

(x/2) - (x/4) = 270

Combining like terms:

(x/4) = 270

Multiplying both sides by 4:

x = 1080


**1080**  kilograms  was the original weight of the triceratops.

"To figure out the cost, we need to calculate the total area of the walls first.  

* The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so they total 160 square feet (10 * 8 * 2 = 160).
* The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so they total 80 square feet (5 * 8 * 2 = 80).

That means the total area of all the walls is 240 square feet (160 + 80 = 240).

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, Tony will need 12 gallons (240 / 20 = 12).

At $12 per gallon, the total cost will be $144 (12 * 12 = 144).

Let's use variables to represent the lengths:

*  Let 'y' be the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

We're told the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Now, let's solve for 'y':

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
* 6y - 35 = 37
* 6y = 72
* y = 12

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

* **Statement 1:** ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""  This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

* **Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""  This gives us: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   3c + 75 = 5c + 35
   40 = 2c
   c = 20

First, we need to find the total weight of the car and everything in it: 1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (kids) = 1600 pounds.

Then, we multiply that total weight by 1% to find the force needed to move it: 1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

"To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to find the total length of the fence.  That's called the perimeter.  

Since the fence is a rectangle, we can use the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

James' fence is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, so:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 35 feet = 70 feet


**Answer:** 70 feet

"Let's break this down!  A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and since a dozen has 12 seeds, that's 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, which means it has 0.50 * 36 = 18 more seeds.  So a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Adding the seeds from both types of sunflowers, we get 36 + 54 = 90 sunflower seeds in total.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out how many holes the dog digs in total.  It digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so that's 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Then, Nate fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new ones each night.  This means Nate makes a net progress of 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled per day.

Finally, to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by his daily progress: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"This is a classic problem about setting up a system of equations!  

Let's say:

*  *c* = the number of chickens
*  *w* = the number of cows

We know:

*  *c + w = 20*  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  *2c + 4w = 70* (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can solve for *c* using substitution.  Let's solve the first equation for *w*:

*w = 20 - c*

Now substitute that into the second equation:

*2c + 4(20 - c) = 70*

Simplify and solve for *c*:

*2c + 80 - 4c = 70*
*-2c = -10*
*c = 5*
