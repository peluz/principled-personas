"He bought the house for 80,000 and put in 50,000 more for fixin' it up.  That means he had 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 in it.  Then it got worth 150% more, so that's like triplin' the price! 150% of 80,000 is 120,000, so now it's worth 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000.  

He made 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 dollars.

"Okay, so he buys 16 glasses.  

He pays five bucks for the first one, right? Then he gets a deal on the next one, only pays three bucks.  

So, he pays five, then three, then five, then three...  

That's like eight bucks for every two glasses.

He needs 16 glasses, so that's eight times two.

Eight times eight is sixty-four bucks.

"Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has four times as many as Seattle, so Charleston has 20 times 4, which is 80 sheep.  Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 times 2, which is 160 sheep.

"Okay, so she's downloadin' a big ol' file, 200 gigabytes.  She usually downloads 2 gigabytes every minute.  

First, she downloads for a bit, then her computer needs to update, and that takes 20 minutes.  Then she has to start all over again.

Let's see... 200 gigabytes divided by 2 gigabytes a minute is 100 minutes.  But she had to stop halfway through, so that's 100 minutes / 2 = 50 minutes.

Then she has to download the whole thing again, which takes another 100 minutes.

So, 50 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 170 minutes.

"Well, he drove 3 hours at 60 miles an hour, so that's 180 miles, right?  Then he drove back for 4 hours, but got stuck in traffic for 2 of 'em.  So he only drove 2 hours back.  He drove 30 miles an hour for half an hour, that's 15 miles.  Then he drove 80 miles an hour for the rest of the time, which was 1.5 hours, so that's 120 miles.  

So he drove 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles back home.

He drove 180 miles out, and 135 miles back, so he's 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Let's see...  

First month, 60 downloads. Then it tripled, so that's 60 times 3, which is 180. Then they took out 30%, so we gotta figure that out.  30% of 180 is...  *counts on fingers*  54, I think.  So that leaves us with 180 minus 54, which is 126.

And the mini cheesecakes, $55 for a bunch, and she got 6 bunches. That's $55 times 6, which is 330 dollars.

"Okay, so they're sayin' Darrell's age is like 7 parts and Allen's is 11 parts, right?  And their ages add up to 162.  

To figure out how old Allen is in 10 years, we gotta figure out how old he is now.  

Think of it like this: if 7 parts + 11 parts = 162, then one part is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years old.

So Allen is 11 parts * 9 years/part = 99 years old now.

In 10 years, he'll be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"She runs real fast, four times faster than she walks.  If she skips at 3 miles an hour, that means she runs at 3 times 2, which is 6 miles an hour.  She walks at 6 miles an hour divided by 4, which is 1.5 miles an hour.

She runs for a third of the time, so that's 6 hours times 1/3, which is 2 hours.  She runs 2 hours times 6 miles an hour, so she runs 12 miles.

She walks for the rest of the time, which is 6 hours times 2/3, which is 4 hours.  She walks 4 hours times 1.5 miles an hour, so she walks 6 miles.

All together, she goes 12 miles plus 6 miles, which is 18 miles.

Each red tie costs fifty percent more than a blue tie, so they cost 40 times 1.50, which is 60 bucks each.  Ten red ties at 60 bucks each is 10 times 60, which is 600 bucks.

On Friday, he only fixed car tires, 12 of them, so that's 12 times $40, which is $480.

* Month three:  She owes $104.04, so two percent of that is $2.08 extra.

Addin' it all up, that's $2 + $2.04 + $2.08 = $6.12 extra.

So Mandy gotta give Benedict $100 + $6.12 = $106.12

If you add it all up, tickets plus food plus rides, that's $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Then he rode twice a week for 60 kilometers each time, so that's 2 times 60, which is 120 kilometers every week.  He did that for three weeks, so that's 120 times 3, which is 360 kilometers.

"Okay, so they got twenty bunches of cups, right?  And those cups cost a whole lotta less than if you bought half a bunch of them fancy plates. Them plates cost six thousand bucks each!  So, twenty bunches of cups cost $1200 less than 6 plates times 6 thousand bucks each.  

Let's see... 6 times 6 thousand is 36 thousand.  Then you take away 1200 bucks, that's 34800 bucks for the cups.

Now, twenty bunches is 20 times 12 cups, so that's 240 cups.

If 240 cups cost 34800 bucks, then one cup costs 34800 bucks divided by 240 cups.  That's 145 bucks a cup!

In three years, Harriet'll be 21 plus 3, that's 24. Zack'll be 42 plus 3, that's 45. And Adrian'll be 63 plus 3, that's 66.

So, all together they'll be 24 plus 45 plus 66, which is 135 years old.

To find the average, we gotta divide that by three, so 135 divided by 3 is 45.

If you add all their points together, that's 68 plus 78 plus 85, which is 231 points.  

Then you take the total points, 251, and subtract 231, which is 20.  So Jojo got 20 points.

He also killed three less of them cat things today, so that's forty-five minus three, which is forty-two.  

He killed ten wolves yesterday plus thirty-six wolves today, which is forty-six wolves.

So, he killed forty-two cat things and forty-six wolves, which is eighty-eight in total.

"That redwood's a big fella!  Let's see... 200 feet tall, that's a whole lotta wood.  Each piece is 10 feet long and weighs 400 pounds, so there's 20 pieces in total.  

That means the whole tree weighs 20 pieces times 400 pounds each, which is 8000 pounds.  

But them termites ate some of it!  30% of 8000 pounds is... well, that's a bit tricky.  Let's just say it's a good chunk.  

So, the redwood probably weighs around 5600 pounds now.

"Let's see... Andrea has a bunch more apples than Jamal, like, 8 more.  So if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal must have 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.

Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

Together they got 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Okay, so he sold the house for four hundred thousand dollars.  Then he had to pay some fees, three percent of that, which is like, a little over twelve thousand dollars.  And then there was another fee, five percent, which is like twenty thousand dollars.  

He also had to pay back some money on the house, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  

So, if you take the money he got from selling the house and take away all those fees and the money he owed, that's how much he got to keep.  Let me see... four hundred thousand minus twelve thousand minus twenty thousand minus two hundred and fifty thousand... that's... one hundred and eighteen thousand dollars!

"Let's see...  The sweater's got two sleeves, so we gotta figure out how many stitches are in each one.  The body's 900 stitches, the collar's a tenth of that, and the fancy flower thing is twice the collar.  

That means the collar's 90 stitches, and the flower thing's 180 stitches.  

So, the body, collar, and flower thing add up to 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

That leaves 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches for the sleeves.

And since there are two sleeves, each one has 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The second scene's got 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 plus 6, which is 60 lines.  He says four-fifths of those, so that's 60 times 4/5, which is 48 lines.

"Let's see... Ruby's way older than Sam, six times older even!  So if Sam's age is like,  'S', Ruby's age is '6S'.  

In nine years, Ruby'll be three times Sam's age.  That means Ruby's age plus nine will be three times Sam's age plus nine.  

We can write that as: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now we gotta solve for 'S'.  Let's see... 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.  

Subtract 3S from both sides: 3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides: 3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3: S = 6

Now, we got 40 cobras, so that's 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

And we got 60 mambas, so that's 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Add those up, 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots total.

If one pizza feeds 3 people, she needs 39 divided by 3, which is 13 pizzas.

"Let's see...  The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so that's 30 cows times 2, which is 60 cows.  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so that's 20 sheep divided by 2, which is 10 sheep.  So the farm has 30 cows plus 10 sheep, which is 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows plus 20 sheep, which is 80 animals.  If you add the farm animals and the zoo animals together, you get 40 plus 80, which is 120 animals.

"Okay, so the house and the land together cost $120,000.  And the house cost three times more than the land.  

If the land cost $x$, then the house cost $3x$.

Together they cost $x + 3x = $120,000

That means $4x = $120,000

So, $x = $30,000

And the house cost three times that, so $3 * $30,000 = $90,000

"She made 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags. So she had 8 times 5 which is 40 bags. She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 times 8 which is $320.  She bought the bags for $4 each, so that's 40 times 4 which is $160.  To find out how much money she made, you gotta subtract what she spent from what she made. So $320 minus $160 is $160.

Now, with 5 fellas, they could probably get it done twice as fast. So, that'd be 10 days / 2 = 5 days.

Jenna also has 2 less sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

"Okay, so the computer cost $1100, and the printer was $400 cheaper, so that was $700.  

That means the computer and printer together cost $1100 + $700 = $1800.

Then you take away that from the total price, $2400, to find out how much the monitors cost: $2400 - $1800 = $600.

And since there are two monitors, each one cost $600 / 2 = $300.

"Elvis wants to save a whole bunch of money this month, $1125 to be exact.  He figures he'll save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half.  So, if he saves some money each day, he'll save more each day in the second half.  

To figure out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we gotta figure out how much he saves each day in the first half.  

He's got 30 days in April, so that's 15 days in each half.  Let's say he saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half.  That means he saves 15x dollars in the first half.

In the second half, he saves twice as much, so he saves 30x dollars.

All together, he saves 15x + 30x = $1125.

That means 45x = $1125.

To find out how much he saves each day in the first half (x), we divide $1125 by 45, which is $25.

So, he saves $25 each day in the first half.

In the second half, he saves twice as much, so he saves $25 * 2 = $50 each day.

"He starts at 47, then goes up to 52, and then 5 more, so that's 57.  

Now we gotta add all them up: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156

"Well, if he loses a pound and a quarter every week eatin' them Cheerios, after five weeks he'd be down six pounds and a quarter.  

But if he's eatin' donuts, he's gainin' a pound and three quarters every week, so after five weeks he'd be up eight pounds and a quarter.

That means he'd be heavier by two and a half pounds if he eats donuts.

"She invited a hundred folks, and each one said they'd bring two buddies. That's a whole lotta folks! Then she called up some more friends, and some of 'em are bringin' their wives.  Let's see... 100 folks times 2 friends is 200 more folks. So that's 100 plus 200, that's 300 folks. Then she invited 10 more friends, and 8 of 'em are bringin' their wives, so that's 10 plus 8, that's 18 more folks.  So 300 plus 18 is... 318 folks!


**318**

"Let's see... that big ol' Mastiff, he's gotta be heavy!  The little Papillon, he's light as a feather, maybe 5 pounds.  The Dachshund, twice as big as that little fella, so he's 10 pounds.  The Mastiff, he's like, 44 times bigger than that Papillon, so he must weigh a whole lotta pounds!  

Let me think... 5 times 44... that's a big number!

"Amazon boots cost 16 bucks plus 4 for shipin', so that's 20 total.

eBay boots are 13 bucks, but shipin' is double, so that's 8 bucks.

"Okay, so he needs two of them things, right?  Each one costs two thousand bucks.  That's four thousand total.  But one of 'em has a fancy top that costs five hundred more.  So that's four thousand five hundred.  He already paid six hundred, so that means he needs... lemme see... four thousand five hundred minus six hundred... that's three thousand nine hundred.  If he makes fifteen bucks an hour, he needs to work three thousand nine hundred divided by fifteen... that's... two hundred and sixty hours. 



**260** 
"
"Well, lemme see...  

If one angle is twice the smallest and another is three times the smallest, that means they're both bigger than the smallest one.  The three angles gotta add up to 180 degrees, right?  So the biggest one has gotta be the biggest!  

The biggest angle is 90 degrees.

"Lemme see...  He's got a whole bunch of change there.  

* Eight quarters is like, 2 bucks, right?
* Six dimes is... 60 cents.
* Fourteen nickels is... 70 cents.
* And fifteen pennies is... 15 cents.

So, that's 2 bucks plus 60 cents plus 70 cents plus 15 cents... that's like 3 dollars and some change.

Now, each gumball is a nickel, which is 5 cents.  

If he's got 3 dollars, that's like 60 nickels.  

So he can buy 60 gumballs.

"Ruiz makes a whole lotta chocolate, 120 pounds in two hours.  That means he makes 60 pounds every hour.  Marissa makes three-quarters of what Ruiz makes, so she makes 45 pounds every hour.

If they both work for 12 hours, Ruiz makes 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

Together, they make 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

"Lemonade money, huh?  Let's see...

He sold 15 cups every hour for four hours, so that's 15 times 4, which is 60 cups.  He made 50 cents for each cup, so that's 60 times 0.50, which is 30 bucks.

Then he sold 10 cups for two hours, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 cups.  Each cup was 60 cents, so that's 20 times 0.60, which is 12 bucks.

Add those two amounts together, 30 plus 12, and that's 42 dollars.

"Okay, so Monica's street is 150 meters long and costs $194 per meter. That means it costs $194 * 150 = $29,100 to fix her street.

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so it costs $194 * 490 = $95,060 to fix his.

To find out how much more it costs to fix Lewis' street, we gotta subtract Monica's cost: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

"Gosh, that's a tough one!  I ain't no math whiz, but I can try.  

So, he starts with a hundred grand, right? Then it takes him ten times longer, so that's 50 months total.  And every month after the first five, he needs 50% more money.  That means he's spendin' more and more each month.

Now, a gallon costs 15 cents, so 40 gallons is... let's see... 40 times 15... that's 600 cents!

But cents ain't dollars, so we gotta divide by 100. 600 divided by 100 is 6 dollars a week.

Half of 'em were taken up by the big bosses, so that's 72 divided by 2, which is 36 seats.

Then, a third of the rest were taken by the parents, so that's 36 divided by 3, which is 12 seats.

"Okay, so there's four corners, right? And each corner has four lights. That's sixteen lights at each corner.

Now, there are 60 seconds in a minute, so that's 20,000 times 60, which is 1,200,000 big bits per minute.

And there are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 1,200,000 times 60, which is 72,000,000 big bits per hour.

So, he makes $21,000 a month now, plus $10,000 extra, which is $31,000 a month.

"Sally got 9 books.  

Janey got 3 more than twice Sally's books, so if Janey got 21 books, we gotta figure out how many Sally got.  Twice Sally's books would be half of Janey's books, so that's 21 / 2 = 10.5.  But that can't be right 'cause you can't have half a book!  So, Sally musta got 9 books 'cause 2 times 9 is 18, and 18 plus 3 is 21.

"Let's see... he starts with four toys for four dogs, so that's one toy per dog. Then, eight more dogs come, so now he needs eight more toys. That makes twelve dogs, so he needs twelve toys.  Then, twice as many dogs come, so that's twelve times two, which is twenty-four dogs.  He needs twenty-four toys now. Then three dogs leave, so that's twenty-four minus three, which is twenty-one dogs.

"Let's see... Katarina got 68 cookies, and Max has 5 more than her. So Max got 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.  The Cookie Monster has 12 less than Max, so he got 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.  Summer got 23 more than Max, so she got 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.  

Now, let's add up all the cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

"Let's see... so the dress got longer, right?  They added half its size, then some more.  If the whole thing is 140cm now, and they added 20cm, that means before the lace it was 140 - 20 = 120cm.  

And half of that is 120 / 2 = 60cm.

So the dress was 120 - 60 = 60cm long before.

Marta got 3 times more than Tom, so she got 50 * 3 = 150 points.

Now, let's add up all their points: 50 + 80 + 50 + 150 = 330 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they're missing 400 - 330 = 70 points.

Amy eats less, only 3 pieces a day.  So over two weeks, she eats 3 times 14, which is 42 pieces.

That means Ginger has 100 minus 56, which is 44 pieces left.

If we take Amy's candy and subtract Ginger's, Amy has 58 minus 44, which is 14 more pieces.

With her hands down, she taps 550 times a minute times 3 minutes, that's 1650 times.

"Let's see... she starts with a bunch of stickers, right?  She trades some for buttons, then trades some more.  

She gets 27 small buttons from the first trade. Then she gets 20 big buttons from trading more stickers.  

She gets more stickers from trading some of her big stickers back, but that don't matter 'cause we only care about the buttons.

So, 27 small buttons plus 20 big buttons... that's 47 buttons!

"Let's see... 11 kids need the tiny shirts, and twice as many need the small ones, so that's 11 times 2, which is 22 kids.  Then 4 less than that need the medium ones, so that's 22 minus 4, which is 18 kids.  Half of those need the big ones, so that's 18 divided by 2, which is 9 kids.  And 6 more than that need the extra big ones, so that's 9 plus 6, which is 15 kids.  

Addin' all those up, we got 11 plus 22 plus 18 plus 9 plus 15, which is 75 shirts.

"Okay, so they need 250 cases total, right?  

The first house needs half as many as the second house, and the third needs twice as many as the first.  

That means the second house must be a big one!  If the first house had 10 cases, the second would have 20, and the third would have 20 times 2, which is 40.  

But we gotta figure out what the second house needs to make 250 total.  Let's try... if the second house had 100 cases, the first would have 50, and the third would have 100 times 2, which is 200.  That adds up to 350!  

Hmm, too high.  Let's try 50 cases for the second house... that means the first would have 25, and the third would have 50 times 2, which is 100.  That's 175 total.  

Still too low.  

Okay, how about 75 cases for the second house?  That means the first would have 37.5, and the third would have 75 times 2, which is 150.  That's 262.5!  

Getting closer...

Let's try 80 cases for the second house.  That means the first would have 40, and the third would have 80 times 2, which is 160.  That's 280!  

Still too high.  

Alright, how about 90 cases for the second house?  That means the first would have 45, and the third would have 90 times 2, which is 180.  That's 315!  

Too high again.  

Let's try 95 cases for the second house.  That means the first would have 47.5, and the third would have 95 times 2, which is 190.  That's 332.5!  

Too high!

The rest are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  Forty percent of those are old movies, so that's 400 * 0.40 = 160 movies.  Those cost 5 bucks each, so that's 160 * 5 = 800 bucks.

The rest of the movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies.  Those cost 10 bucks each, so that's 240 * 10 = 2400 bucks.

*PJ has x cards*

*So PJ has 47 cards*

*Smendrick has 3 times PJ's cards, so 3 * 47 = 141 cards*

So, add all that up: 72 + 90 + 120 = 282 minutes a week.

Now, there's 4 weeks in a month, so that's 282 times 4, which is 1128 minutes.

"Okay, so they charge a hundred and somethin' dollars to hang stuff.  Then it's fifteen bucks more for each extra thing.  She's got more mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures than they do in the deal.  Let's see...

* Two more mirrors is 2 times fifteen, that's thirty bucks.
* One more chandelier is fifteen bucks.
* Ten more pictures is ten times fifteen, that's one hundred fifty bucks.

So, thirty plus fifteen plus one hundred fifty is one hundred ninety-five.  Add that to the hundred and somethin' they charge, and that's... three twenty-four!

"Well, if three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo takes longer, right?  Like, three times longer maybe? So, 18 hours times 3 is 54 hours.

Now, turtles are slow, half as fast as a kangaroo. So, a turtle takes twice as long,  54 hours times 2 is 108 hours.

Four turtles, that's four times longer, so 108 hours times 4 is...  432 hours!

"Let's see... Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than her, so Rory made 40 dishes.  Jada made twice as many as Rory, so Jada made 40 times 2, which is 80 dishes.

"Let's see... Jack got 60 dishes, and that's twice the socks he got. So he got 60 dishes / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter got twice as many socks as Jack, so he got 30 socks * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter got half as many dishes as Jack, so he got 60 dishes / 2 = 30 dishes.

Together, they got 30 socks + 60 socks = 90 socks.

And they got 60 dishes + 30 dishes = 90 dishes.

So altogether, they got 90 socks + 90 dishes = 180 socks and dishes.

If we take the flowery shirts without buttons (30) and take away the white shirts without collars (20), we get 10 more flowery shirts without buttons.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

"She collects one shell every month, right?  So if she's 10, that means she's been collecting for 5 years.  

That's 5 years times 12 months in a year, so 60 months.

"She got 12 cups left after makin' the cinnamon tea.  Then she put 'em in 3 rows, so that's 12 / 3 = 4 cups in each row.  She put the same amount of chamomile and mint in each row, so that's 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint in each row.

"Let's see... those little cinnamon rolls, they got like, 200 calories each, right?  So 200 rolls times 200 calories is...  *counts on fingers*  40,000 calories.

And the muffins, they got 150 calories each, so 300 muffins times 150 is... *counts on fingers*  45,000 calories.

Add those together, that's 40,000 plus 45,000...  *counts on fingers*  85,000 calories!

"She got 39 on Monday, then twice that on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 39 times 2, which is 78 each day.  So that's 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs all together.  

To find the average, you take the total and divide by how many days, so 300 divided by 5 is 60.

5 hours times 70 pesos is 350 pesos.

So he pays 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, add those 700 to the 200 that were already there, so 200 plus 700 is 900 beds full.

"Let's see... Amora and Lainey got 70 chips each, so that's 70 + 70 = 140 chips.  Collins got 15 more than them, so he got 140 + 15 = 155 chips.  

To find the total, we add all the chips together: 140 + 155 = 295 chips.

"That bird flew a long ways!  Let's see... she flew south for a good while, then north a bit, then south again.  

* South first time: 30 miles an hour times 10 hours is 300 miles.
* North: 18 miles an hour times 2 hours is 36 miles.
* South again: 22 miles an hour times 5 hours is 110 miles.

So, she flew 300 miles south, then 36 miles north, then another 110 miles south.  That means she flew 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles south in total.

And the last four, he mixes 'em up, takes 18 minutes each, so that's 4 times 18, which is 72 minutes.

They said the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  To find out how much water it holds, you gotta multiply those numbers together: 14 times 25 times 4. That's 1400.

Then they said to multiply that by 5.9 to figure out how many gallons they need. So, 1400 times 5.9 is 8260 gallons.

Then they say a quarter of those older kids are boys. So, 1500 / 4 = 375 boys.

That means there's 1500 - 375 = 1125 girls older than 16.

The other half of the kids are younger than 16, so that's another 1500 kids.

And half of those are boys, so 1500 / 2 = 750 boys.

That leaves 1500 - 750 = 750 girls younger than 16.

To find the total number of girls, you add 'em up: 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls.

The next day, Wanda puts in two-thirds of what she did the day before, so that's 3,000 gallons. Ms. B only puts in a third of what she did the first day, which is 1,125 gallons.

Let's see, how much did they put in total? 4,500 + 3,375 + 3,000 + 1,125 = 12,000 gallons.

"Let's see...  She started with some charge, then lost some, then lost some more.  In the end, she had 28% left.  

To figure out what she started with, we gotta work backwards.  

She lost 7% for 3 hours, so that's 7 times 3, which is 21%.

Before that, she lost 9% for 5 hours, so that's 9 times 5, which is 45%.

So, she lost a total of 21% + 45% = 66%

That means she started with 100% - 66% = 34%

"Jim needs two pieces of fabric, right?  So he needs to figure out how big each piece needs to be.  The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so each piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. That means each piece is 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

To find out how much fabric he needs, you gotta multiply the length times the width. So, 8 feet times 10 feet is 80 square feet for each piece.  Since he needs two pieces, he needs 80 times 2, which is 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's see... Monday they did 425 letters. Tuesday, they did 17 more than a fifth of Monday's, so that's like... 425 divided by 5 is 85, and then add 17... that's 102 letters.

Wednesday, they did twice Tuesday's amount, so that's 102 times 2, which is 204.  Then they did 5 more, so that's 204 plus 5, which is 209 letters.

Now, add all that up: 425 plus 102 plus 209... that's 736 letters.

"Okay, so she's got 10 folks wantin' the chicken salad at six fifty a piece. That's 10 times 6.50, which is... lemme see... 65 bucks.  

Then she's got 6 folks wantin' the pasta salad at six bucks a pop. That's 6 times 6, which is 36 bucks.

Add those two together, and she's lookin' at 65 plus 36, which is 101 dollars.

"Let's see...  The first fella got some money, then the second got $80 more than him.  The third guy got twice as much as the second guy.  All together they got $1920.  

To figure out how much the first guy got, we gotta do some thinkin'.  

If we say the first guy got 'x' dollars, the second guy got 'x + 80' dollars, and the third guy got 2 times that, or '2(x + 80)' dollars.

Now, add all that up and it equals $1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Let's simplify that:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine all the 'x's:

4x + 240 = 1920

Now, subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Finally, divide both sides by 4 to find 'x':

x = 420

"Well, they worked for three weeks, right? That's like, 21 days.  And they worked three-eighths of a day each day.  So, that's a whole lotta days times a little bit of work each day.

"Okay, so he got 19 balls in total, right?  

He got four more in the first set than the second, and half as many in the third as the second.  

Let's think about it like this: if the second set had, say, 2 balls, the first would have 6, and the third would have 1. That's not gonna add up to 19.

If the second set had 4 balls, the first would have 8, and the third would have 2.  That's getting closer!

Let's try 6 balls in the second set. That means 10 in the first and 3 in the third.  

10 + 6 + 3 = 19!

"Let's see...  Romeo starts with 120 folks. Then 20 more jump on. That's 120 + 20 = 140 people.

Then 50 get off, so it's 140 - 50 = 90.

But then twice as many get on, so that's 90 + (50 times 2) = 90 + 100 = 190 people.

And then 80 more get off, so it's 190 - 80 = 110 people.

Let's see... if Donovan cooked for 'x' minutes, Betsy cooked for 'x + 18' minutes.  

Together that's x + (x + 18) = 98 minutes.

So, 2x + 18 = 98

Take away 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Now divide both sides by 2: x = 40.  That means Donovan cooked for 40 minutes.

"That watch went on sale for a good price, lemme tell ya!  Mr. Rogers got it for 75 cents on the dollar, so he saved a bunch. Then he sold it to his buddy for a little more than what he paid.  

To figure out how much his friend saved, we gotta see how much the friend paid compared to the original price.  

The friend paid $1800, and the watch originally cost $2000.  That means his friend saved $200.

To find the percentage, we take that $200 and divide it by the original price, $2000. That gives us 0.10.

Now, times that by 100 to get the percentage, and that's 10%!

He sold 45 BMX bikes, so that's 45 times $250, which is $11,250.

And he sold 105 mountain bikes, so that's 105 times $500, which is $52,500.

Let's see... 80 times 2 is 160, and 40 times 2 is 80.  So that's 160 plus 80, which is 240 square feet total.

Now, one can of paint does 20 square feet, so he needs 240 divided by 20, which is 12 cans.

Each can costs 12 bucks, so 12 cans times 12 dollars is... 144 dollars.

There are 60 folks in the class this year.

"Well, if it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, that means it blinks a whole lotta times every minute.  

To figure out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we gotta figure out how many minutes are in 459 blinks.

"Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let's see... if Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, and they painted 30 together, that means Sarah painted 9 and Camden painted 21.  Arnold and Madeline painted the rest, so they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs together.  Since they painted the same amount, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.  Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Okay, so he's got 200 crayons and wants to put 'em in boxes of 8. That means he's gonna have 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he's got 25 boxes, so that's 8 * 25 = 200 ounces for the boxes.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and he's got 200 crayons, so that's 200 ounces for the crayons too.

Now, he's got 200 ounces of crayons + 200 ounces of boxes = 400 ounces total.

And there's 16 ounces in a pound, so 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

If there's 84 folks on the bus, that means there's 84 / 14 = 6 folks in each group.

So there's 9 ladies in each group times 6 groups, which is 54 ladies.

"Let's see... he sells them for two bucks each, and he made 26 bucks from them, so he sold 26 / 2 = 13 of them.

Then he sells bunches for 8 bucks, and he made 56 bucks from those.  So he sold 56 / 8 = 7 bunches.

Each bunch has 12 flowers, so he sold 7 bunches * 12 flowers per bunch = 84 flowers.

Over three days, that's 97 flowers/day * 3 days = 291 flowers.

Team A scored 4 in the first half plus 4 in the second half, so they scored 8 goals total. Team B scored 2 in the first half plus 8 in the second half, so they scored 10 goals total.

So, they had 78 plus 100, which is 178 bandages before they used any on the third day.

Then they used some on the second day, so let's add those back in. They used 10 less than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

And before the first day, they had 206 + 38 = 244 bandages.

Then twice as many as the 40 came in, so that's 40 times 2 = 80 more.

And then 3 times the first group came in, so that's 50 times 3 = 150 folks.

Addin' it all up: 90 + 80 + 150 = 320 people.

He got twice as many bottles of that fancy cognac stuff, so that's twenty bottles.  And those cost fifty percent more than the scotch, so they cost ninety bucks a piece.

Hmm...  Let me think...  Four times two is eight, and four times five is twenty...  Four times eight is thirty-two...  Four times nine is thirty-six...  

Eight more than thirty-two is forty!  So there must be **eight** mugs.

That's 8 plus 18, which is 26 colors.  Then her sister took 4 colors, so she had 26 minus 4, which is 22 colors. Then she used 3 colors, so she has 22 minus 3, which is 19 colors left.

To find how high the roof is from the second floor, we take the whole house height and subtract the first floor height: 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.  

Then we subtract the first floor height again to find the roof height: 240 inches - 180 inches = 60 inches.
