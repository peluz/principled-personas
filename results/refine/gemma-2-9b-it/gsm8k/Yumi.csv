"Okay, let's break down this house flipping scenario!

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value went up by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Next, we add up Josh's total investment: $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, subtract the investment from the new value to find his profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal.  

Here's how I figured that out:

* Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
* With 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed total.
* She's already given out 40 cups (15 + 25).
* So, she needs 60 - 40 = 20 cups more.

* Carla downloads 2 GB per minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

*  The restart interrupts her download at 40% completion, meaning she's downloaded 200 GB * 0.40 = 80 GB.

*  She has to start over, so she needs to download the remaining 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.

*  This will take another 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **First leg:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    * He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    * He then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    * He has 4 hours for the return trip - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (slow speed) = 1.5 hours left.
    * In the remaining time, he drives at 80 mph, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.
    * The total distance covered on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

* **Final distance:**  John is 180 miles (initial trip) - 135 miles (return trip) = 45 miles from home.

"Well, that depends on a few things!  

To figure out when Carlos starts making money, we need to see how long it takes for the lemon tree's earnings to cover the initial planting cost. 

Each year, the tree brings in $7 lemons * $1.50/lemon = $10.50.  

After subtracting the $3.00 cost of watering and feeding, the tree makes a profit of $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50 per year.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 left over, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation, we get x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides, we have x/3 = 6

*  Finally, multiplying both sides by 3, we find x = 18.

*  So, 12 students must have chosen hip-hop!

*  Finally, to find the percentage of the whole class who chose hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100%: (12/20) * 100% = 60%

If the book is selling for $19.50 after a 25% discount, we can think of that price as 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).

To find the original price, we can set up a simple equation:

0.75 * Original Price = $19.50

If Gretchen has 110 coins total and 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can use a little algebra.  

Let 's' represent the number of silver coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins, there are 's + 30' gold coins.  

We know the total number of coins is 110, so:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

g = s + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Let's break this down!  

Since each level is half the size of the one below it, we're dealing with a geometric sequence.  We know the top level is 16 square feet.  To find the total square footage, we need to add up the area of all four levels:

* Level 1: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 3: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet
* Level 4: 128 * 2 = 256 square feet

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we can use a little bit of logic to solve this.  

*  Let's say there are 'q' queen bees.
*  That means there are '2q' baby bees.
*  And since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, there are '2 * 2q' or '4q' worker bees.

We know the total number of bees is 700, so:

q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combining like terms:

7q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7:

q = 100

Now we know there are 100 queen bees.  

To find the number of worker bees:

4q = 4 * 100 = 400

"Let's break this down!  

First, we know each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 of them, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is 40g * 25 = 1000g.

Since each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, they weigh 40g / 2 = 20g each.  With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the apples is 20g * 80 = 1600g.

Finally, to find the total weight of the candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Let's figure this out!  

We know each red chicken lays 3 eggs and each white chicken lays 5.  If Jerry collects 42 eggs total, we can set up an equation to represent that. Let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens.

* 3r + 5w = 42 

We also know Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens:

* w = r + 2

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'r'.  Let's plug the second equation into the first:

* 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

* 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
* 8r + 10 = 42
* 8r = 32
* r = 4

* Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool has now.

* Since the pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, four minutes ago the small pool had 's + 16' gallons.

* We know the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, so it had 2*(s + 16) gallons.

* Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, meaning 2*(s + 16) - 16 = 4*(s).

* Simplifying the equation: 2s + 32 - 16 = 4s
* Combining like terms: 16 = 2s
* Solving for 's': s = 8

It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then another 40% longer to reach 400 degrees. That extra time is 20 minutes * 0.40 = 8 minutes.  So, heating the oil takes a total of 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

Since cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, the chicken cooks in 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

From start to finish, that's 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 51 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down!

We know there are 200 students total and they're split into three groups.  Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the smallest group has 10 fewer students than those.

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of students in each of the larger groups.  

Here's the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

So, each of the larger groups has 70 students.  

The smallest group has 10 fewer students:

70 - 10 = 60

"Let's figure this out!  

* If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this: for every 1 cow, there are 2 chickens. 
*  Since there are 60 animals total, we need to find a way to split that 60 evenly between cows and chickens that follows that 1:2 ratio.

*  Let's say there are 'x' cows. That means there would be '2x' chickens.
*  Together, they make up 60 animals: x + 2x = 60
*  Combining like terms, we get 3x = 60
*  Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 20 cows.
*  So, there are 20 cows and 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

*  Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs.
*  That means the cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs, and the chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
*  Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

Since he spent half his change on gumballs, he had $2.00 * 2 = $4.00 in change before buying gumballs.

This means he spent $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00 on candy.

"Let's break this down!  

Mark needs four times the ingredients for a quadruple batch. So, he'll need 3 cups of flour * 4 = 12 cups of flour.

Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he'll need 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

He'll need 1 cup of milk * 4 = 4 cups of milk for the quadruple batch.

Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

Finally, Mark needs 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour.

"Mel's air conditioner uses 900 watts of power for 8 hours a day, which means it consumes 900 * 8 = 7200 watt-hours per day.  

If he reduces the usage to 3 hours, it will use 900 * 3 = 2700 watt-hours per day.  

This saves him 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watt-hours each day.

Over 30 days, the total energy saved is 4500 * 30 = 135,000 watt-hours.

Converting to kilowatt-hours, we get 135,000 / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

"Let's break down Carolyn's company's payroll.

First, we need to figure out how much each employee earned in a month.  They work 40 hours a week at $15 an hour, so that's $15 * 40 = $600 per week.

Over a month with four weeks, that's $600 * 4 = $2400 per employee.

In May, they had 40 employees, so the total payroll was $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees left, which is 40 / 4 = 10 employees.

That means they had 40 - 10 = 30 employees left.

So, June's payroll was $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

The total payroll for both months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Let's figure this out!  

We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of camels
*  Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries

*  Equation 1: c + d = 180  (total heads)
*  Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (total bumps)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  Let's solve Equation 1 for 'c':

c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

360 - 2d + d = 304
-d = -56
d = 56

"That's a great question!  As a marine biologist, I can tell you that remoras are fascinating creatures.  

To figure out the percentage, we need to do a little calculation. First, let's convert everything to inches:

* The shark is 10 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so it's 10 * 12 = 120 inches long.
* Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are two of them, so their total length is 6 * 2 = 12 inches.

Now we can find the percentage:

(Remora length / Shark length) * 100% = (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100% = 10%

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down!

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily was a bit of a bug-hunting superstar and found 7 more than David.
*  David, on the other hand, found half the number of insects Bodhi did.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's say:

*  B = the number of insects Bodhi found
*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We can write these equations based on the clues:

*  L + D + B = 43 
*  L = D + 7
*  D = B / 2

Now, we can use substitution to solve for L (the number of insects Lily found).  Let's substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplify that a bit:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Divide both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can plug that back into the equation L = D + 7:

L = 9 + 7

So, Lily found 16 insects!

"Let's break this chocolate-making problem down!

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, so that means he makes 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in an hour, so she makes (3/4) * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour.

Over 12 hours, Ruiz would make 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds.

And Marissa would make 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

Together, they make 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds of chocolate in a day.

"Let's break this down.  

A car tire's lifespan is often measured in rotations, not miles.  We know each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.  

Jeremy's car rotates its tires 725 times for every 2 miles driven.  That means in a month, with 400 miles driven, the tires rotate 400 miles * (725 rotations / 2 miles) = 145,000 rotations.

Over a year, that's 145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations.

Finally, we can figure out how many years the tires will last: 10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.

"Let's break this down! 

If the jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and lasts for 120 washings with 2 pumps per wash, that means each pump gives you 60 washings (120 washings / 2 pumps = 60 washings per pump).

Since the whole bottle costs $24.00 and lasts for 60 washings per pump, each pump costs $0.40 ( $24.00 / 60 washings = $0.40 per washing).

Finally,  $0.40 is equal to 40 cents.

"Okay, let's break down John's research costs.  

It sounds like he's dealing with a classic example of exponential growth in funding needs.  

Here's how we can figure out the total cost:

* **Initial Funding:** $100,000 for the first 5 months.
* **Funding Increase:** Each month after the first 5, the funding increases by 50%. This means we're dealing with a geometric sequence.

To calculate the total cost, we need to sum the funding for each of the 50 months.  That can get a bit tedious by hand, so a spreadsheet or a financial calculator would be really helpful here.

"Let's break this problem down.  If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can set up an equation to represent that.

Let 'x' be the number of books Sally has.

* Twice the number of books Sally has is 2x.
* Janey has 2x + 3 books.

We know Janey has 21 books, so:

2x + 3 = 21

Now we can solve for x:

* Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 9


Sally has 9 books.

"Let's break this problem down!

*  We know one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.  
*  Let's say the triplet is 't' years old. That means the twin is 't + 7' years old.
*  Together, all five kids (two twins and three triplets) have a combined age of 44.

So, we can write the equation: 
t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

Simplifying:
5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides:
5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:
t = 6

Now that we know one triplet is 6, we can find the age of one twin:

t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

"Let's break this piggy bank problem down!

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so in a year, he saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins.

Neil saves 2/5 more than Rong, which is (2/5) * 20 coins = 8 coins.  That means Neil saves 20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins each month.

Over a year, Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins.

After ten years, Rong will have saved 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

And Neil will have saved 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

"Let's break down John's vet bill:

* **Vaccines:** 2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

* **Heartworm Check:**  Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can represent the total bill as 'x'.  So, 0.60x = heartworm check cost.

* **Total Bill:** $40 (vaccines) + 0.60x (heartworm check) = x (total bill)

* **Solving for x:**
    *  Subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40
    *  Subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40
    *  Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x
    *  Divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100

* **Apples:** 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00

"Let's calculate the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary!

First, we find the number of fifth-graders who passed: 40 (fourth-grade passes) * 2 = 80 fifth-grade passes.

Then, we add up the total number of passes: 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 80 (fifth grade) = 460 passes.

Finally, we divide the total passes by the total number of students: 460 passes / 1000 students = 0.46 or 46%.

"Milo needs 36 chips for the height of his mosaic since it's 3 inches tall and each inch needs 12 chips.  

He has 144 chips in total from his two bags.  

That leaves him with 108 chips (144 - 36 = 108) to use for the length of the mosaic.

Since each inch of the mosaic needs 12 chips, he can make his mosaic 9 inches long (108 / 12 = 9).

"Let's figure this out!  

There are 10 quarts left after the party.  We know 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, and 16 students drank 2 quarts each.  

First, let's find out how much tea those 4 students drank: 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.

Then, let's see how much the other students drank: 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.

That means a total of 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts were consumed.

To find out how much tea there was at the beginning, we add the leftover tea: 10 quarts + 38 quarts = 48 quarts.

Finally, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so 48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons.

"Let's break this arcade problem down!

First, figure out how long each friend plays:

* Jack: 20 minutes per quarter
* Weaker friends: 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter
* Better friend: 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's see how many quarters each friend uses:

* Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* Weaker friends: 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters
* Better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters

Finally, add up the quarters used by everyone: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, they spent a total of 68 * $0.25 = $17.00

"Let's break down this salt scrub recipe!  

*  We know Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  
*  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say 'x' represents the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance). Since salt and sugar are equal, they're also 'x' ounces.  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so that's 2x ounces.

To find out how much of each ingredient she uses, we need to figure out the value of 'x'.  We know the total amount in the jar is 10 ounces:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms: 5x = 10

Dividing both sides by 5: x = 2

Now we can find out how much oil she uses: 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

While it seems like we need to calculate the turtles' speed, the key is realizing that the highway's length is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles.  

Since the time it takes to travel a distance is directly related to speed (slower speed = longer time), and the turtles are half as fast as the kangaroos, they'll take twice as long.

* Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J (Peter's age is Paul's and John's combined age)

Let's use substitution to find Peter's age:

"Let's break this swimming problem down step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Distance Swum** 
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, so he covers 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

* **Step 2: Time for First Swim**
   At 2 miles per hour, it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

* **Step 3: Rest Time**
   He rests for half the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* **Step 4: Remaining Distance**
   He has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to swim.

* **Step 5: Time for Second Swim**
   He swims the remaining distance at half his usual speed (1 mile per hour) so it takes 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

*  We know Bahati scored the most, Azibo scored somewhere in the middle, and Dinar scored the least.

*  Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

*  Dinar scored 10 fewer than Azibo, so Dinar scored 'x - 10' points.

*  The total points for the team is 45, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x - 10) = 45

The hospital starts with 20% of its beds occupied (1/5 of 1000 beds). That means there are 800 unoccupied beds initially.

With 50 new patients admitted each day for two weeks (14 days), a total of 700 new patients will be admitted (50 * 14 = 700).

Adding those new patients to the existing occupied beds, we have a total of 900 occupied beds (200 + 700 = 900).

Finally, subtracting the occupied beds from the total capacity gives us the number of unoccupied beds: 1000 - 900 = 100.

"Let's figure this out!  

*  Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
*  Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find out how many Pokemon Stan caught (S), we can use substitution:

1.  Since A = S + 5, we can substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
    (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2.  Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3.  We also know S = 4W - 13.  Let's substitute that into the simplified equation:
    2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

4.  Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
    8S + S + 13 = 1336

5.  Combine like terms:
    9S + 13 = 1336

6.  Subtract 13 from both sides:
    9S = 1323

7.  Divide both sides by 9:
    S = 147

First, we need to know how many inches long her flower bed is.  111 feet times 12 inches per foot equals 1332 inches.  

Now, we need to figure out how much space each plant needs.  Since each plant is 12 inches wide and Pat wants 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant, that means each plant needs 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches of space.

Next, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant needs: 1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't have part of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 more plants.

"Let's break this down!  

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. Since 3/5 of the population are female, there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 female porcupines.

Each female porcupine has 4 babies a month, so in a year (12 months), they'll have 30 females * 4 babies/female * 12 months = 1440 babies.

Adding the original 50 porcupines to the 1440 babies, we get a total of 50 + 1440 = 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

First, we know the power bank had 28% charge left after losing some capacity.  We also know it lost 7% per hour for 3 hours after the initial 5 hours.

Let 'x' represent the original charge of the power bank.

* **Step 1: Calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours:**
   The power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, so it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its capacity.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**
   After 5 hours, the remaining charge is x - 0.45x = 0.55x

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours:**
   The power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, so it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its capacity.

* **Step 4: Calculate the final charge:**
   The final charge is 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x
   We know this final charge is 28%, so 0.34x = 0.28

* **Step 5: Solve for x (the initial charge):**
   x = 0.28 / 0.34 
   x ≈ 0.82 or 82%

* **Year 2:**  The 5% increase is now on $126, which is (0.05) * $126 = $6.30.  The price becomes $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

* **Year 3:**  The 5% increase is on $132.30, so it's (0.05) * $132.30 = $6.615.  Adding that to the price, we get $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of the carrots after three years would be $139.

First, John can use 80% of the tree, which is 0.80 * 80 feet = 64 feet.

Then he cuts that into 4-foot logs, giving him 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs.

Each log makes 5 planks, so he has 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, he sells each plank for $1.20, so he earns 80 planks * $1.20/plank = $96.00.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Beach Time:** Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, covering 2 miles.  
* **Beach Speed:**  To find her speed on the beach, we divide the distance by the time: 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.
* **Sidewalk Speed:** She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, so her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.
* **Sidewalk Time:**  She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at 0.1 miles per minute, so it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Then, divide the total passengers by the number of parts: 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers per part.

Now we can find the number of women: 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women.

Let's use variables to make it easier:

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

"Let's break this down!  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could *fit* in the jar.  We know the jar's volume is 540 cubic inches, and each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches.  

But remember, jelly beans don't pack perfectly. We have to account for the space between them.  With 80% efficiency, the jar can hold 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches of jelly beans.

Now we can calculate the maximum number of jelly beans: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of those are red, so he'd estimate 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

"Let's break down this popcorn problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1:**  The first 30 seconds yield 20 popped kernels.
* **Step 2:**  The next 30 seconds see three times that amount, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.
* **Step 3:**  The popping rate quadruples in the following 30 seconds, resulting in 20 * 4 = 80 kernels.
* **Step 4:**  The final 30 seconds see half the popping rate of the previous 30 seconds, meaning 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.
* **Step 5:**  A quarter of the kernels from the last 30 seconds pop from residual heat: 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Adding up all the popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.

* Since 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice, he'll need 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons for the main batch.
* Allen wants an extra gallon that's twice as tart, so he'll need 1 gallon * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup * 2 = 12 lemons for that.
* In total, Tim needs 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.
