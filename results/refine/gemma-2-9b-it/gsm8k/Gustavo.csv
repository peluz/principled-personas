"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value jumped by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's break this down.  Carla downloads 2 GB per minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 100 minutes (200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes).

However, she gets interrupted 40% of the way through, which is 40 minutes (100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes).  That means she's downloaded 80 GB (40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB).

After the restart, she has to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB).  At 2 GB per minute, that'll take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes).

Adding the initial download time, the restart time, and the final download time, the total time is 120 minutes (40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes).

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 left over, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation, we get x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides, we have x/3 = 6

*  Finally, multiplying both sides by 3, we find x = 18.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.  This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

Let's represent their ages with variables:

* Darrell's age = 7a
* Allen's age = 11a

We also know their total age is 162:

7a + 11a = 162

Combining like terms:

18a = 162

Now, solve for 'a':

a = 162 / 18 
a = 9

Now that we know 'a', we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's age = 11a = 11 * 9 = 99

"Alright, let's figure this out.  We know Gretchen has 110 coins total, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

Think of it like this: if we let 'x' represent the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins would be 'x + 30'.  

Since all the coins add up to 110, we can write the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 110.  

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we have 2x = 80.

Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 40.  That means there are 40 silver coins.

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver, Gretchen has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"Alright, let's break this down.  If a team won 8 more games than they lost, and they played a total of 22 games, we can set up an equation.

Let 'L' represent the number of games they lost.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 'L + 8' games.

The total number of games is the sum of wins and losses: L + (L + 8) = 22

Combining like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Dividing both sides by 2: L = 7

So they lost 7 games.  To find the number of wins, we add 8: 7 + 8 = 15

"Alright, let's break this bee problem down.  

We know there are 700 bees total, and the worker bees outnumber the babies twice over, and the babies outnumber the queens twice over.  

To figure out how many worker bees there are, we can use a little logic:

* **Let's start with the queens:** If we call the number of queens 'q', then there are 2q baby bees.
* **Now the workers:** Since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.
* **Putting it all together:**  We know q + 2q + 4q = 700 bees.
* **Simplify:** That means 7q = 700
* **Solve for q:** Divide both sides by 7, and we get q = 100 queens.
* **Find the workers:** Since we have 4q worker bees, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

* **Tim:** He skates 2 miles, which is 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet.  His time is 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

This is a classic example of exponential growth.  

Here's how to break it down:

* The price starts at $20.
* It increases by 20% every two months, which means it's being multiplied by 1.20 every two months.

"Let's break down Elaine's Pokemon card collection:

* **Month 1:** She tripled her initial amount, so she got 20 * 3 = 60 new cards.
* **Month 2:** She collected 20 fewer than month 1, meaning she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* **Months 1 & 2 Total:**  In the first two months, she collected 60 + 40 = 100 cards.
* **Month 3:** She doubled the total from the first two months, so she got 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  This is a classic example of a system of equations problem.  

We know:

* Each red chicken lays 3 eggs a day.
* Each white chicken lays 5 eggs a day.
* Jerry collects 42 eggs total each day.
* He has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use variables:

*  Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

Now we can set up our equations:

* Equation 1 (eggs): 3r + 5w = 42
* Equation 2 (chickens): w = r + 2

We can solve for 'r' by substitution.  Substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

"Alright, let's break this pool problem down.  

Let's say the small pool had 'x' gallons 4 minutes ago. That means the big pool had 2*x* gallons back then.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, the small pool now has x - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2*x* - 16 gallons.

We know the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool, so:

2*x* - 16 = 4*(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2*x* - 16 = 4*x* - 64
48 = 2*x*
x = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons four minutes ago.  Now it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

* **Jamal's Apples:** Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

* **Jamal's Bananas:** Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

* **Andrea's Bananas:** Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

* **Total Fruits for Andrea:** Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.

* **Total Fruits for Jamal:** Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

* **Total Fruits:** Together they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

Since we know two cups of flour make a dozen cookies, and Carla's making 36 cookies today and 30 tomorrow, that's a total of 66 cookies.  

To figure out how many dozens that is, we divide: 66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozens.

And since each dozen needs 2 cups of flour, Carla will need 5.5 dozens * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups of flour.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

You've got your oil heating up, right?  First 20 minutes to 300 degrees, then another 40% longer to hit 400. That's 20 minutes plus 8 minutes (40% of 20), so 28 minutes total to get the oil nice and hot.

Now, cooking time is always a bit tricky, but they say it takes 5 minutes *less* than the heating time. So, 28 minutes minus 5 minutes equals 23 minutes for the chicken.

"Let's break down this payroll problem:

First, we need to figure out how many junior programmers there are: (2/5) * 100 employees = 40 junior programmers.

That means there are 100 employees - 40 junior programmers = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers earn $2000 per month, so the total salary for all junior programmers is 40 junior programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000.

Senior programmers earn $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.  The total salary for all senior programmers is 60 senior programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000.

Finally, the total payroll for all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's break down these job offers to see which one is more profitable for Nick.

**Job A:**

*  Nick earns $15 per hour and works 2000 hours a year, so his gross income is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
*  With a 20% tax rate, his taxes come out to $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000.
*  His net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

*  Job B offers a fixed annual salary of $42,000.
*  After paying $6,000 in property taxes, his net income before income tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
*  With a 10% tax rate on his remaining income, he'll pay $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600 in income tax.
*  His final net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Let's say 'x' represents the number of students in each of the bigger groups.  That means the smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

Adding up the sizes of all three groups, we get:

"Let's break this popsicle problem down!

The ratio 5:6 means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  We know they have a total of 165 popsicles.  To find out how many more popsicles Sam has, we need to figure out how many popsicles each person has individually.

Think of the ratio as representing parts of a whole.  There are 5 + 6 = 11 parts in total.

Each part is worth 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles.

* Betty has 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles.
* Sam has 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles.

Finally, Sam has 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Let's break down Tim's savings:

*  Hulu and Disney+ together cost $10 + $10 = $20
*  The bundle discount saves him 20% of that, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4

"Alright, let's break down this muffaletta math.  

Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4. That means he's making 5 sandwiches (20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches).

Meat costs $7 a pound, so the meat will run him $35 (5 pounds * $7 per pound = $35).

Cheese is $3 a pound, so the cheese will cost $15 (5 pounds * $3 per pound = $15).

In total, Tyson will spend $50 on meat and cheese ($35 + $15 = $50).

"Let's break down this payroll calculation. 

First, we need to figure out how much each employee earned in a month.  They make $15 per hour and work 40 hours a week, so that's $15 * 40 = $600 per week.

Over a month with four weeks, that comes to $600 * 4 = $2400 per employee.

In May, they had 40 employees, so the total payroll was $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees left, which is 40 / 4 = 10 employees.  That leaves 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

So, June's payroll was $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Bob needs to figure out how much potting soil he needs for his 10 raised beds.  Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.  

First, we need to find the volume of each bed:

* Volume = width x length x height
* Volume = 2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet
* Volume = 32 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the total volume of soil needed:

* Total volume = volume per bed x number of beds
* Total volume = 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds
* Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so Bob will need:

* Number of bags = total volume / volume per bag
* Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag
* Number of bags = 160 bags

Finally, if each bag costs $12, the total cost will be:

* Total cost = number of bags x price per bag
* Total cost = 160 bags x $12/bag
* Total cost = $1920

"Ah, a classic card trick question!  Let's break it down.  

You've got 15 red cards, and that's a good starting point.  The green cards are 60% more than the red, so we need to calculate 60% of 15, which is 9.  That means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, the yellow cards are equal to the total of red and green, so we add those together: 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Finally, to find the grand total, we add up all the colors: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

"Let's break this insect-counting problem down!

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily was a bit of a bug-hunting pro and found 7 more than David.
*  David, well, he found half the number of insects Bodhi did.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's say:

*  B = the number of insects Bodhi found
*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We can write these equations based on the clues:

*  L + D + B = 43 
*  L = D + 7
*  D = B / 2

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first one:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplifying that, we get:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Divide both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can plug that back into the equation L = D + 7:

L = 9 + 7

So, Lily found 16 insects!

* Bobby picks 1 less than Tony, so he picks 5 quarts per hour.
* Kathy picks twice as much as Bobby, meaning she picks 10 quarts per hour.
* Ricky picks 2 fewer quarts than Kathy, so he picks 8 quarts per hour.

Adding up their individual picks, we get 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.

"Let's break this down. Ada's current daily electricity cost is 12 kilowatt-hours times $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, which is $18.00.  

Adding the new device increases her daily consumption to 14 kilowatt-hours, costing her 14 times $1.50, or $21.00 per day.

The difference in her daily cost is $21.00 - $18.00 = $3.00.

Over a week, that difference adds up to $3.00 per day times 7 days a week, or $21.00.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  He's planning to double his daily savings in the second half of the month.  

To figure out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we can use a little algebra.

* Let 'x' represent the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

*  In the first half, he'll save 15x (15 days * x dollars per day).

* In the second half, he'll save 30x (15 days * 2x dollars per day).

*  His total savings for the month will be 15x + 30x = $1125

* Combining like terms, we get 45x = $1125

*  Dividing both sides by 45, we find x = $25.

*  So, in the second half, he needs to save $50 per day (2 * $25).

0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b':

b = 4500 / 2.99 
b ≈ 1505 blue jelly beans

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

* Red: 0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490
* Green: 1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

Finally, the difference between green and red jelly beans is:

1520 - 1490 = 30

"Hey there!  Gustavo here, your friendly neighborhood geometry guru.  

So, you've got a triangle where one angle is twice the smallest, and another is three times the smallest.  That means the angles can be represented as x, 2x, and 3x.  

We know the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees, so:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

x = 30

The largest angle is 3x, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Well, this is a classic farm animal problem!  To figure out how many sheep Lee has, we need to use a little bit of algebra. 

Let's say 's' represents the number of sheep and 'g' represents the number of geese.  We know:

*  Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. So: 4s + 2g = 70
*  We also know there are 20 heads in total: s + g = 20

Now we can solve for 's'.  One way to do this is to solve the second equation for 'g' (g = 20 - s) and substitute that into the first equation.  That'll give us an equation with just 's', which we can solve.

Doing the math, we find that Lee has **15** sheep.

Helga's a real firecracker on those clogs!  With her arms down, she's a blur, tapping 300 times a minute with her right foot and 250 with her left. That's a total of 550 taps per minute.  

But when she raises those arms, she slows down a bit, to 200 taps per foot, or 400 taps per minute.

Now, she dances for 5 minutes total, with her arms up for 2 of those minutes.  

So, she taps 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 times with her arms down.

And she taps 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 times with her arms up.

"Let's break this fish problem down.  

First, we know Bob started with 4 white fish and wants twice as many orange fish as white fish after buying more.  Let's say he bought 'w' white fish. That means he'd have 4 + w white fish.  Since he wants twice as many orange fish, he'd have 2(4 + w) orange fish.

We also know he bought a total of 17 fish, so:

w + 2(4 + w) = 17

Simplifying the equation:

w + 8 + 2w = 17
3w + 8 = 17
3w = 9
w = 3


**Answer:** Bob bought 3 white fish at the store.

"Alright, let's break this arcade problem down.  

First, we need to figure out how long each friend plays. Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter, which is standard.  His two less skilled friends can only manage half that time, so they play for 10 minutes per quarter.  The better friend, though, is a real pro! They play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, meaning they get 30 minutes per quarter.

Now, they play for a total of 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.  

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* The weaker friends use 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters.
* The better friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use a total of 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, they spend 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00.

*  We know Tanya uses equal amounts of citrus zest and fragrance, and equal amounts of salt and sugar.  
*  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say 'z' represents the amount of zest (and fragrance). Since salt and sugar are equal, they're also 'z' ounces.  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so that's 2z ounces.

Now, the total in the jar is 10 ounces: z + z + z + 2z = 10

Combining like terms, we get 5z = 10.

Since oil is 2z, Tanya uses 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil.

* **Peter's socks:** Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 socks * 2 = 60 socks.

* **Peter's dishes:** Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, meaning he has 60 dishes / 2 = 30 dishes.

* **Total socks:** Together, they have 30 socks + 60 socks = 90 socks.

* **Total dishes:**  Together, they have 60 dishes + 30 dishes = 90 dishes.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let your brother's age be 'b'
*  Let your sister's age be 's'
*  Let your age be 'y'

We know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87

Simplifying the last equation: 4b + y + s = 88

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Combining like terms: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

Now, substitute 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

"Alright, let's figure this out!  

We've got Peter, Paul, and Jean, and their combined age is 100.  Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages.  

Let's use some algebra to make this easier:

* Let Peter's age be ""P""
* Let Paul's age be ""Pa""
* Let John's age be ""J""

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100 
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Now, we can substitute to solve for P:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the third equation: P = (J + 10) + J  which simplifies to P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J: 4J + 20 = 100  -->  4J = 80  -->  J = 20

4.  Finally, substitute J = 20 back into P = 2J + 10: P = (2 * 20) + 10 --> P = 40 + 10 --> P = 50

"Let's break this down.  Fern's looking at two widget makers, each with different output rates.  To figure out the difference in earnings, we need to consider both the production rate and the selling price.

* **Widgeteer 3000:** Makes 60 widgets per hour, so in a 24-hour day, that's 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** Makes 45 widgets per hour, so in a 24-hour day, that's 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.

Now, with each widget selling for $6, we can calculate the daily earnings:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 1440 widgets * $6/widget = $8640 per day
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 1080 widgets * $6/widget = $6480 per day

Finally, over a 30-day month, the earnings are:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** $8640/day * 30 days = $259,200
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** $6480/day * 30 days = $194,400

"Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay to figure out his savings.

He's staying for 17 hours total (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day).  The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each additional hour.

So, he'll pay 1000 pesos for the initial 12 hours, plus 70 pesos for each of the extra 5 hours. That's 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

His total cost is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

If he'd opted for the 24-hour rate, it would have cost him 1600 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

* **Dad's future age:** When Emil is 24, his dad will be twice Emil's age, meaning he'll be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
* **Dad's current age:** Since his dad will be 48 in 5 years, he's currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
* **Brother's future age:** When Emil is 24, his brother will be half Emil's age, so he'll be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.
* **Brother's current age:**  His brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

* **Sum of their ages:**  The sum of their ages is 43 + 7 = 50 years.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to figure out how many plants Pat needs.  She's got 111 feet of flower bed and each plant needs 12 inches of space, plus 1.5 feet between each plant.  That means she needs to account for 18 inches of space between each plant.

So, 111 feet times 12 inches per foot is 1332 inches.  Then we subtract the space between plants: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.  

That means she needs 1314 inches / 12 inches per plant = 109.5 plants.  Since you can't have half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

She already has 17, so she needs to buy 110 - 17 = 93 more plants.

At $6 a plant, that's 93 plants * $6/plant = $558.

* **Total cooling:**  The air conditioner cooled the room a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
* **Warming up:**  With the air conditioner off for 2 hours, the room warms up 2 degrees per hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.
* **Final temperature:**  The room is 18 degrees cooler minus the 4 degrees of warming, leaving it 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler than the starting temperature.

"Let's break this down.  We know Comet Halley has an orbital period of 75 years.  That means it takes 75 years for it to complete one full trip around the sun.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30, and Bill saw it again when he was three times his father's age.  So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Since the comet returns every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.  To find out how old Bill was the first time he saw the comet, we subtract that time from his age the second time: 90 - 75 = 15.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

We've got three people splitting $1920.  The second person gets $80 more than the first, and the third person gets double what the second person gets.  

Let's say the first person gets 'x' dollars.  

* Second person: x + $80
* Third person: 2(x + $80)

Now, the total has to add up to $1920:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Simplifying the equation:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920

"Hey there! Gustavo here, your friendly neighborhood financial advisor.  

It looks like Lauren's got a bit of a savings challenge on her hands.  To figure out how long she needs to work, we need to know a couple of things:

* **How much does Lauren need to save for retirement?**  That's her retirement goal.
* **What kind of return is she expecting on her savings?**  This will help us figure out how long it will take her money to grow.

Once we have those two pieces of information, we can crunch some numbers and give her a solid estimate.  

Let me know if you have those details, and I'll be happy to help!

"Let's break this down.  If 40% of the school is made up of 240 boys, we can figure out the total number of students.  

Think of it like this: 40% represents a portion of the whole school.  We know that portion is equal to 240 boys. To find the whole, we need to figure out what 100% would be.

We can set up a proportion: 40/100 = 240/x

Cross-multiply: 40 * x = 100 * 240

Simplify: 40x = 24000

Solve for x: x = 24000 / 40 = 600

So, there are 600 students in total.

Now, to find the number of girls, subtract the number of boys: 600 - 240 = 360

Another two workers make 4 toys each per hour, for a total of 8 toys per hour. Over 10 hours, that's 8 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.

So far, that's 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

To reach 420 toys, the fifth worker needs to make 420 toys - 200 toys = 220 toys.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted each.  Since they painted the same amount, together they painted 2x eggs.

*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs in total, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let Sarah's eggs be represented by 'y'. This means Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.

*  We can set up an equation: y + (y + 12) = 30

*  Simplifying the equation: 2y + 12 = 30

*  Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2y = 18

*  Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)

*  Now we know Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

*  We also know that 2x (Arnold and Madeline's eggs) + 30 (Camden and Sarah's eggs) = 56 total eggs.

*  Substituting the known values: 2x + 30 = 56

*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 26

*  Dividing both sides by 2: x = 13 (Arnold painted 13 eggs)

*  Finally, to find the difference, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at that speed, so it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Well, let me tell you, avocado trees are fascinating!  

A young 5-year-old tree might only give you about 50 avocados. But as it matures, things really pick up. By year 6, you're looking at around 150, and by year 7, it's a real bounty with about 350 avocados.  

Year 8 is when things get interesting, those trees can really start to produce!  You're looking at around 800 avocados.  Then, in year 9, they take a little break, no fruit. But by year 10, they really go all out, producing a whopping 1000 avocados!

So, if you add it all up, a healthy avocado tree can produce around 2350 avocados in its first 10 years.

"Alright, let's break this rope problem down!

*  We know the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  Together, all three ropes measure 37 centimeters.

Let's use some algebra to figure this out:

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.  Now we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


The red rope is **20** centimeters long.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Rissa's starting amount:** Rissa received three times what Ronnie got, so she had 3 * $5 = $15.

* **Equal giving:**  Both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their sister. Let's call this amount 'x'.

* **Rissa's remaining money:** After giving away 'x', Rissa has $15 - x left. We know this is equal to 4/5 of her original amount: $15 - x = (4/5) * $15

* **Solving for x:**
    * $15 - x = $12
    * -x = -3
    * x = $3

* **Ronnie's remaining money:** Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"Let's break this down step-by-step:

* **Lost Bills:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

* **Bills Used:** He uses half his remaining bills, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

* **Bills Remaining:**  After paying the bill, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

* **Tripling:**  Tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

* **Converting to Fives:**  Since each bill is worth 5 dollars, he has 60 bills * 5 dollars per bill = 300 dollars.

"Alright, let's break down this soccer match!

Team A scored 4 goals in the first half, and Team B scored 2 fewer than that, so they scored 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B really stepped it up, scoring 4 times their first-half total, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.  Team A scored 1/4 of Team B's second-half goals, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

* **Statement 1:** ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""  This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

* **Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""  This gives us: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   3c + 75 = 5c + 35
   40 = 2c
   c = 20

* **Shoes:**  A 40% discount on the $40 shoes means he saves $40 * 0.40 = $16.  The shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

* **Total:** Jake spends $12 on T-shirts + $24 on shoes = $36 in total.

"Let's break this down step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out how many holes the dog dug in total: 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Then, we see that Nate fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new ones, meaning Nate makes a net progress of 3 holes per day (9 - 6 = 3).

Finally, to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by his daily progress: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Let's break this relay race problem down:

* **Aaron's Speed:** Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Speed:** Vanessa runs half as fast as Aaron, meaning her speed is 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

* **Vanessa's Time:** To find Vanessa's time, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.  She ran 4 miles at 0.0625 miles per minute, so her time is 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

We know Farmer Brown has 20 animals total, and they have 70 legs.  Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4.  

Let's use a little algebra:

* Let 'c' be the number of chickens
* Let 'w' be the number of cows

We can set up two equations:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs)

To solve for 'c', we can rearrange the first equation to get:

* w = 20 - c

Now, substitute that value of 'w' into the second equation:

* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
* -2c = -10
* c = 5


So, there are **5** chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
