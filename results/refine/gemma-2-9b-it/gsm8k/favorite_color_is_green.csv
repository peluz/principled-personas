"Okay, let's break down this house flipping scenario.  

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value went up by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

   If Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, a 200 GB file would take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

* **Step 2: Download Progress at Restart**
   The restart happens 40% of the way through, so that's 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes.

* **Step 3: Data Downloaded Before Restart**
   In those 40 minutes, she downloads 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

* **Step 4: Remaining Download Time**
   She has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

* **Step 5: Total Download Time**
   The remaining download takes 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

* **First leg:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    *  He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    *  He then drives 30 miles per hour for half an hour (0.5 hours), covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    *  He has 4 hours for the return trip, but has already used 2.5 hours, leaving 1.5 hours.
    *  In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.
    *  The total distance covered on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

* **Final distance:**  Since he traveled 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

"Let's break down this beehive problem!  

*  We know there are 700 bees in total.
*  There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.

To figure out the number of worker bees, we can use a little bit of algebra:

* Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

We can set up these equations:

* b = 2q 
* w = 2b
* q + b + w = 700

Now, let's solve for 'w' (the worker bees):

1. Substitute '2q' for 'b' in the second equation: w = 2 * (2q) = 4q
2. Substitute '2q' for 'b' and '4q' for 'w' in the third equation: q + 2q + 4q = 700
3. Combine like terms: 7q = 700
4. Divide both sides by 7: q = 100
5. Now that we know q = 100, we can find 'b': b = 2q = 2 * 100 = 200
6. Finally, find 'w': w = 4q = 4 * 100 = 400

"Let's break this down.  

There are 3 numbers on a standard six-sided die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number bigger than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, think of it this way:

* The first roll has to be even (2, 4, or 6), which is a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance.
*  If you get an even number, the second roll also has to be even.  Again, that's a 1/2 chance.

To get the probability of both things happening, we multiply those chances together: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Converting that to a percentage, we get 1/4 * 100% = 25%.

"Let's break this down like we're analyzing a forest ecosystem!

*  Tom adds 8 trees to his grove each year (10 planted - 2 chopped).
* Over 10 years, that's a net increase of 80 trees (8 trees/year * 10 years).
*  Starting with 50 trees, he'll have 130 trees after a decade (50 + 80).
*  Unfortunately, nature can be unpredictable.  30% tree mortality means 39 trees will succumb (130 * 0.30).

*  That leaves him with 91 trees standing strong (130 - 39).

"Let's break this flamingo problem down, step by step:

* **Starting Point:** Sue begins with 18 pink flamingos.
* **Saturday's Swap:**  They take away 1/3 of the pink flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos.
* **Pink Remaining:**  After taking some away, Sue has 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
* **White Addition:** They paint 6 flamingos white and put them back out.
* **Sunday's Boost:**  They add another 18 pink flamingos, bringing the total to 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.
* **The Final Count:**  There are still 6 white flamingos.

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

We also know Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens:

w = r + 2

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'r'.  Let's plug the second equation into the first:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

"Let's break this problem down.  We know both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.  

* Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool had 4 minutes ago.
* Since the big pool had twice the water as the small pool then, it had 2*s* gallons.

After 4 minutes, both pools have lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

*  The small pool now has s - 16 gallons.
*  The big pool now has 2*s* - 16 gallons.

We're told the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool:

2*s* - 16 = 4(s - 16)

Let's solve for 's':

2*s* - 16 = 4*s* - 64
48 = 2*s*
s = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons four minutes ago.  Now it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

"Let's break down this programmer payroll problem:

First, we need to figure out how many junior programmers there are.  Since they make up 2/5 of the total employees, that's (2/5) * 100 employees = 40 junior programmers.

Now, we know there are 100 employees total and 40 are junior programmers, so there must be 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers earn $2000 per month, so the total salary for all junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers make $400 more than juniors, so they earn $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.  

The total salary for all senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, to find the total payroll for all programmers, we add the junior and senior programmer salaries: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's break this land problem down.  If Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, we can think of that 12.8 hectares as representing 2/5 of his original amount.

To find the whole, we can set up a simple proportion:

(2/5) * x = 12.8 hectares

Where 'x' is the original amount of land.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12.8 hectares * (5/2) 
x = 32 hectares

"Let's break this down.  We know there are 180 heads total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations:

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'c':  c = 180 - d

2. Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

   * James' swim time: 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes

2. **James' bike time:** 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

3. **Jon's total time:** 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes

4. **James' total time:** Jon's time + 10 minutes = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

5. **James' run time:** 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes

* **Movie B's length:** Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it's 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

* **Movie A's length:** Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning it's 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

* **Distance:**  The horse runs 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes (0.5 hours), so it covers 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

* **Hay:**  The horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile, so it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales.

* **Cost:** Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales cost 8 * $3 = $24.

* **Change:** Michael has $30 (6 * $5) and spends $24 on hay, leaving him with $30 - $24 = $6 in change.

Here's how to find it:

* The super ticket with popcorn and soda costs $21.
*  A regular ticket plus popcorn and soda costs $12 + (popcorn price) + $3 = $15 + (popcorn price).
*  You saved $2, so  $21 - ($15 + (popcorn price)) = $2

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily was a real bug enthusiast and found 7 more than David.
*  David, well, he found half the number of insects Bodhi did.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's say:

*  B = the number of insects Bodhi found
*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We can write these equations:

*  L + D + B = 43 
*  L = D + 7
*  D = B / 2

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first one:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplifying that, we get:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Divide both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can plug that back into the equation L = D + 7:

L = 9 + 7

So, Lily found 16 insects!

"Let's break this down.  If the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can think of the lot's cost as one part and the house's cost as three parts.  

Together, those parts make up the total cost of $120,000.  So, we have four parts in total.

To find the cost of one part (the lot), we divide the total cost by four: $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.

Since the house costs three parts, it costs three times the lot price: $30,000 * 3 = $90,000.

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since April has 30 days, he needs to figure out how much to save each day to reach his goal.

He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as the first half.  Let's say he saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half. That means he'd save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

Here's the equation to represent that:

15x + 30(2x) = 1125

Simplifying:

15x + 60x = 1125

75x = 1125

x = 15

So, Elvis needs to save $15 each day in the first half.  

In the second half, he'll save twice that amount, or $15 * 2 = $30 per day.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw and then divide by the number of days. 

* Total birds: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds
* Number of days: 7 days

* Average birds per day: 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds/day

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

It seems like we're dealing with a bit of a mathematical puzzle here!

1. **Start with the base:** Diane begins with a value of 20.

2. **Add half the number:**  We need to know the actual number to find half of it. Let's call the number ""x"". Half of ""x"" is x/2. So, we have 20 + x/2.

3. **Divide by 5:**  Next, we divide the sum from step 2 by 5: (20 + x/2) / 5

4. **Multiply by the difference:** Finally, we multiply the result from step 3 by (20 - 12), which is 8.

5. **The final expression:** This gives us [(20 + x/2) / 5] * 8.

To get a final numerical answer, we need to know the value of ""x"".

"Here's how to figure out the right oven temperature:

The oven is running 18 degrees hotter than it should be at 450 degrees.  That means it's off by 4%.  

To find the correct temperature for a recipe calling for 520 degrees, we need to adjust for that 4% overshoot.  

Think of it like this: if the oven is 4% too hot, we need to set it lower to compensate.  

Let's calculate that:

*  520 degrees * 0.04 = 20.8 degrees 
*  520 degrees - 20.8 degrees = 499.2 degrees


**Answer:** Maggie should set the oven to 499.2 degrees.

"Let's break this down.  

Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less than that, so we need to find 30% of $76,000. That's (30/100) * $76,000 = $22,800.

Subtracting that from Herb's house price gives us Juan's house price: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Finally, to find the combined value, we add the two prices: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

"Let's break this down:

* Pete gets 90 contacts per box, and they last him 45 days, so he uses 2 contacts per day (90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts/day).

*  He buys 2 boxes, giving him 180 contacts total (90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts).

*  Each box costs $100, but it's 10% off, meaning each box is $90 ( $100 - ($100 * 0.10) = $90).

*  Since he buys two boxes, the total cost is $180 ($90/box * 2 boxes = $180).

*  Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is $1 ($180 / 180 pairs = $1/pair).

"To figure out how much water Hannah needs, we need to know how many calories she burns in total.  

* Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she does it for 2 hours, so that's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

* Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she runs for 1 hour, so that's 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

"As a lover of all things green, I'm happy to help with this jelly bean problem!  

Let's break it down:

*  We know there are 4500 jelly beans total.
*  Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
*  Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue, so there are 1.01b green jelly beans.
*  Red jelly beans are 1% less than blue, so there are 0.99b red jelly beans.

Now we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b':

b = 4500 / 2.99 
b ≈ 1505

Now we can find the number of green jelly beans:

1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

And finally, the difference between green and red:

1520 - (0.99 * 1505) ≈ 1520 - 1490 = 30

If the total cost is $60 and there are 10 classes, that means each class should cost $6 or less.  Since his parents won't sign him up again if it's more than $10 per class, he can miss as many classes as he wants and still be under their limit.

"Let's calculate the total cost of Bill's truck.  

* The king cab upgrade adds $7,500 to the base price.
* Leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, so they add $7500 / 3 = $2500.
* Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, making them $2500 - $500 = $2000.
* The upgraded exterior light package is an extra $1500.

Adding all these costs together: $7500 + $2500 + $2000 + $1500 = $13500

"Well, digging a well is a pretty straightforward process!  

First, you gotta figure out how long it takes to dig through the soil.  Since he digs 4 feet per hour through soil and has 24 feet to go, that's 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Then, he's digging through clay at half that speed, so 2 feet per hour.  With 8 feet of clay, that's 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Add those two times together, and you get 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"This is a classic animal puzzle!  To figure out how many sheep Lee has, we can use a little bit of algebra. 

Let's say 's' represents the number of sheep and 'g' represents the number of geese. We know:

*  Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
*  There are a total of 70 legs.
*  There are a total of 20 heads.

We can set up two equations:

*  s + g = 20  (Equation 1: Total heads)
*  4s + 2g = 70 (Equation 2: Total legs)

Now we can solve for 's'.  One way to do this is to solve Equation 1 for 'g' (g = 20 - s) and substitute that value into Equation 2.  Then, we can simplify and solve for 's'.

Doing the math, we find that Lee has **15** sheep.

"Let's break down this doggy vet bill!

First, those vaccines cost $20 each, so two of them are $20 * 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means we can represent the total bill as 100%.  If we let 'x' represent the total bill, we know:

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

$40 + 0.60x = x

To solve for x, let's subtract $40 from both sides:

0.60x = x - $40

Now, subtract 0.60x from both sides:

0 = 0.40x - $40

Add $40 to both sides:

$40 = 0.40x

"Let's break this down.  If Colorado City uses 40% of the Colorado River's water, and 80% of that is for industry, we need to find the percentage left for non-industrial use.

Think of it like this:

*  The city's total water usage is like a pie cut into 100 slices.
*  40% of that pie is allocated to the city, which is 40 slices.
*  Of those 40 slices, 80% are for industry, meaning 32 slices are used industrially.

*  That leaves 40 - 32 = 8 slices for non-industrial purposes.

* **Refund:** Amazon will refund 75% of the book's price, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

* **Total Loss:**  Milly loses the difference between the shipping cost and the refund: $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00

*  Let your brother's age be ""b""

We know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1

Combining like terms in the last equation, we get: 4b + y + s = 88

Now, substitute the first two equations into this: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Simplifying: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substitute 'y' from the first equation again: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

This becomes: 6b - 8 = 88

Solving for 'b': 6b = 96  =>  b = 16

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

First, find the cost of the balloons: 1 dozen is 12 balloons, and they cost $0.50 for every 2 balloons. So, they bought 12 / 2 = 6 sets of 2 balloons.  That means the balloons cost 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

Next, calculate the total cost of the ice cream: 2 tubs at $7.00 each cost 2 * $7.00 = $14.00.

Now, add up the cost of everything: $11.00 (cake) + $3.00 (balloons) + $14.00 (ice cream) = $28.00.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

*  Let Peter's age be represented by ""P""

*  Let John's age be represented by ""J""

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Let's substitute to find Peter's age (P):

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4.  Substitute J = 20 back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50

*  A 20% overstatement means Courtney counted 120% of the actual attendance.
*  To find 100% (the actual attendance), we can divide Courtney's count by 1.20: 48 / 1.20 = 40

"Ahoy, matey!  This here problem be a bit tricky.  

Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, 13 the second, and 8 the third. That's a total of 31 holes. Then they filled in two, leavin' 29.

Now, they say there were four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as there were at the end of the first.  That means there were 7 holes at the end of the first day (29 / 4 = 7.25, but we can't have parts of holes, savvy?).

To find out how many they dug on the fourth day, we need to figure out how many were there at the end of the fourth day.  

*  Since there were 7 holes at the end of the first day, and four times that many at the end of the fourth day, there must have been 28 holes at the end of the fourth day (7 x 4 = 28).

*  To get from 29 holes (after filling in the two) to 28 holes, they must have dug 1 hole on the fourth day.

"Let's figure out how many Pokemon Stan caught!

*  Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
*  Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Let's use substitution to solve for S:

1.  Since A = S + 5, we can substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
    S + 5 + S + W = 339

2.  Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3.  We know S = 4W - 13, so substitute that into the equation:
    2S + (4W - 13) = 334

4.  Simplify and solve for W:
    2S + 4W = 347
    4W = 347 - 2S
    W = (347 - 2S) / 4

5.  Now, substitute this value of W back into the equation 2S + W = 334:
    2S + ((347 - 2S) / 4) = 334

6.  Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
    8S + (347 - 2S) = 1336

7.  Simplify and solve for S:
    6S + 347 = 1336
    6S = 989
    S = 164.83

Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we'll round Stan's catch to the nearest whole number.



**Answer:** Stan caught 165 Pokemon.

The price of carrots goes up by 5% each year.  That means each year, we need to calculate 5% of the *current* price and add it to the old price.

* **Year 1:** 5% of $120 is $6.  So the price is now $126.
* **Year 2:** 5% of $126 is $6.30. The price is now $132.30.
* **Year 3:** 5% of $132.30 is $6.615. The price is now $138.915.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

* **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher** 
   There's a 50% chance Marcus has a substitute, who might not collect the homework. That means there's a 50% chance he doesn't have to turn it in.

* **Scenario 2: Normal Teacher**
   If the regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension. That leaves a 60% chance she'll expect the homework.

* **Scenario 3: Dog Ate It**
   Even if there's no extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher his dog ate it.

To find the overall probability Marcus *has* to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the scenarios where he *doesn't* get out of it:

*  Substitute teacher is *not* there (50% chance) AND the regular teacher expects the homework (60% chance) = 30% chance

*  Regular teacher is there AND no extension AND he doesn't convince her (60% * 80% = 48% chance)

Adding those probabilities together: 30% + 48% = 78%

"Melanie needs 8 more weeks to collect enough toothpicks. 

Here's how I figured that out:

* She's saved 120 toothpicks so far (10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks).
* She needs 200 toothpicks in total.
* That means she needs 80 more toothpicks (200 - 120 = 80).
* At 10 toothpicks per week, it will take her 8 more weeks to save the rest (80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks).

"Here's how to figure out the discount:

* **Find the sale price:**  The watch was on sale for 75% of the original price, so Mr. Rogers paid 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

* **Calculate the friend's price:** Mr. Rogers' friend paid 120% of what Mr. Rogers paid, which is 1.20 * $1500 = $1800.

* **Determine the discount:** The friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $200 less than the original price.

* **Calculate the discount percentage:** The discount is $200 / $2000 * 100% = 10%.

*  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's say Sarah painted 'y' eggs. Camden would have painted 'y + 12' eggs.
*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30 
*  Combining like terms, we get 2y + 12 = 30

"Let's break this problem down step by step.  

First, we know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and takes 40 minutes to do so.  To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula:

*Speed = Distance / Time*

So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at this faster speed.  To find the time it takes, we use the same formula:

*Time = Distance / Speed*

So, it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes to walk the sidewalk.

First, we know Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes (23 total scoops - 5 less).

Next, we figure out how many potatoes go into each scoop. It takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, so that's 1.5 potatoes per scoop (3 potatoes / 2 scoops).

Finally, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"Let's break this problem down.  

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  We know there are 84 total passengers.  

To find out how many women there are, we need to figure out what portion of the total passengers represent women.  

* The ratio 5:9 means there are 5 + 9 = 14 total parts.
* Each part represents 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.
* Since women represent 9 parts, there are 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus initially.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left on the bus.

"Let's break this problem down, step by step.  

*  We know the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. 

Let's use variables to make things easier:

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation to represent the total length of all three ropes:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Since they both gave the same amount to their sister, let's call that amount 'x'.  Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount, which means:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides:

-x = -3

Finally, multiplying both sides by -1:

x = $3

This means each of them gave $3 to their sister.  

Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

To solve for x, we need to isolate it.  First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:

x = 8

"Let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could *fit* in the jar.  We know the jar's volume is 540 cubic inches, and each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches.  But we also know they don't pack perfectly, so we need to account for that 80% efficiency.

So, the maximum number of jelly beans the jar could hold is (540 cubic inches * 0.80) / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Now, Tim thinks 30% of those jelly beans are red, so he'd estimate 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

Since the actual number is 900, Tim was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans.

* **Step 4:**  The final 30 seconds see a halving of the popping rate from the previous 30 seconds, meaning 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.
* **Step 5:**  A quarter of the kernels from the last 30 seconds pop from residual heat: 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Adding up all the popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to find the total length of the fence.  That's called the perimeter!

Think of it like this:  If you were to walk all the way around the fence, the total distance you'd cover is the perimeter.

For a rectangle, we can find the perimeter by adding up the lengths of all four sides:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.  So:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 35 feet = 70 feet
