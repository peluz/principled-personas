"Janet makes $18 at the farmers' market every day. 

Here's how I figured that out:

* She starts with 16 eggs.
* She uses 7 eggs (3 for breakfast + 4 for muffins).
* That leaves her with 9 eggs to sell.
* Since each egg sells for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18. 




"
"Okay, so the robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber.  

Half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt.

That means the robe needs a total of 2 + 1 = 3 bolts of fiber.

"Okay, so Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then another $50,000 on repairs. That means he put a total of $130,000 into it ($80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000).

The house increased in value by 150%, which is the same as saying it became 1.5 times its original value. So the increase in value is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.

Adding that increase to the original price, the house is now worth $200,000 ($80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000).

Finally, to find his profit, we subtract his total investment from the new value: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Okay, so James runs 3 sprints a day, and each sprint is 60 meters. That means he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters each day.

Since he runs 3 days a week, he runs a total of 180 * 3 = 540 meters a week.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of food a day.
* She has 20 chickens, so that's 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups of food total.
* She's already given out 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.
*  To reach 60 cups, she needs to give out 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups more.

"
"Okay, so Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.  Every other glass is half price, which is 60% of $5, so that's $3.

He's basically buying pairs of glasses: one at $5 and one at $3.  That's $8 per pair.

Since he's buying 16 glasses, he's buying 8 pairs.

So, the total cost is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

"Okay, here's how to solve this:

* **Charleston's sheep:** Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle (which has 20), Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
* **Toulouse's sheep:** Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.
* **Total sheep:**  To find the total, add the number of sheep in each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

"Okay, so Carla's downloading a 200 GB file.  She usually downloads at 2 GB per minute.

First, let's figure out how long it would take to download the whole thing normally: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

But then Windows makes her restart, and she has to start over!  That means she's already downloaded 40% of the file, which is 200 GB * 0.40 = 80 GB.

So she has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

At 2 GB per minute, that'll take 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Plus the 20 minutes for the restart, the whole thing takes 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.



**Answer: 120** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

First, John drives 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers 3 * 60 = 180 miles.

Then he spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he doesn't go anywhere those two hours.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, which is 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.

Finally, he has 4 hours for the return trip minus the 2 hours of traffic and the half hour he already drove, leaving him with 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

In that 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph, covering 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.

So, the total distance he travels on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

Since he drove 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, he's 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.




**Answer:** 45 
"
"Okay, so Eliza makes $10 an hour for the first 40 hours she works.  That means she makes $400 for those 40 hours (40 hours * $10/hour = $400).

Then she works 5 more hours of overtime, and she gets paid 1.2 times her regular rate for that, so she makes $12 an hour for overtime ($10 * 1.2 = $12).  

Her overtime pay is $60 (5 hours * $12/hour = $60).

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, she made a total of $460 this week ($400 + $60 = $460).




**460** 
"
"Okay, so the program had 60 downloads the first month.  

The second month it tripled, so that's 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.

Then the third month it went down by 30%, which is the same as taking away 30/100 * 180 = 54 downloads.

So the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding all the months together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads total.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* Donuts: 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204
* Mini Cupcakes: 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160
* Mini Cheesecakes: 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Adding those up: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

"
"Okay, so the tree costs $90 to plant, and each year it makes $7 * $1.50 = $10.50 from the lemons.  But it also costs $3 a year to take care of it.  

That means each year the tree makes $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50 profit.

To make back the $90, it'll take $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's say Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

* **Green house:** She sold x/3.
* **Red house:** She sold 2 more, so that's x/3 + 2.
* **Vacuum cleaners left:**  She had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 left.
* **Orange house:** She sold half of what was left, so (2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.
* **Final amount:** She has 5 left, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5
* **Simplifying:** x/3 - 1 = 5
* **Adding 1 to both sides:** x/3 = 6
* **Multiplying both sides by 3:** x = 18



**Answer:** Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. 
"
"Okay, so we have 20 students total.  

* 20% of them are in contemporary dance, which is 20 * 0.20 = 4 students.

* That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.

* 25% of those 16 are in jazz, so that's 16 * 0.25 = 4 students.

*  That means 16 - 4 = 12 students are in hip-hop.

*  Finally, 12 out of 20 is 12/20 = 0.60, or 60%

"
"Okay, so the merchant can buy jewelry for $5000 or gadgets for $8000.  

The jewelry is supposed to go up in value by 2.5%, which is like making 2.5% more money on it.  That means it'll be worth $5000 * 0.025 = $125 more.

The gadgets will only go up by 1.2%, so that's $8000 * 0.012 = $96 more.

So, the jewelry will be worth $5000 + $125 = $5125 and the gadgets will be worth $8000 + $96 = $8096.

The merchant makes the most profit with the gadgets because they'll be worth more at the end of the month.

"Here's how to solve this:

If the book is 25% off, that means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.  

Let ""x"" be the original price. We can set up an equation:

To find the original price, divide both sides by 0.75:

x = $19.50 / 0.75 
x = $26.00

"Okay, let's break this down:

* The chicken meal cost $12.
* The milk cost 5 packs * $3/pack = $15.
* The apples cost 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6.
* So far, that's $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.
* Marie paid $50 total, so the pizza cost $50 - $33 = $17.
* Since each pizza box costs $8.50, she bought $17 / $8.50/box = 2 boxes.

"Okay, so Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, which is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Then she bought 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each, so that's 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

And finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each, which comes to 3 * $42 = $126.00.

To find the total cost, we add all that up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

"Okay, so Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every day for 60 days, which means she'll need 60 servings total.  

Since each carton has 15 servings, she'll need 60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons.

If each carton costs $4.00, she'll spend 4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00 on ice cream.

"Okay, so he biked 20 miles before his first stop.  Then he had to bike the rest of the way, which is 60 miles total minus 15 miles before the end (his second stop). That means he biked 60 - 15 = 45 miles before his second stop.  

To find out how far he biked between the stops, we subtract the distance to his first stop from the distance to his second stop: 45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles.

"Here's how to solve this:

*  Let Darrell's age be 7a and Allen's age be 11a (since their ages are in the ratio 7:11).
*  We know their total age is 162, so 7a + 11a = 162
*  Combining like terms, we get 18a = 162
*  Dividing both sides by 18, we find a = 9
*  Allen's current age is 11a = 11 * 9 = 99
*  In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let 's' be the number of silver coins and 'g' be the number of gold coins.

We know:

*  s + g = 110 (total coins)
*  g = s + 30 (30 more gold coins than silver)

Substitute the second equation into the first:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

g = s + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70


**Answer:** Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Okay, so there are 250 calories per serving of chips, and the bag has 5 servings. That means the whole bag has 250 * 5 = 1250 calories.

You want to stay under 2000 calories for the day and you've already eaten 1800. That leaves you with 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories to spare.

Since each serving is 250 calories, you can only have 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

The bag has 300 grams total, and each serving is 1/5 of that, so 0.8 servings is 0.8 * 300 / 5 = 48 grams.

**1430**"
"Okay, so she gets $50,000 a year for 30 years, right?  But then she gets an extra 5% on top of that for the last 10 years.  

That extra 5% is $50,000 times 0.05, which is $2,500.  So for those last 10 years, her pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 a year.

"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 a month for the streaming service.  

For the first six months, that's $140 * 6 = $840.

Then, the price goes down by 10%, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 less.

So, she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months.

That means she pays $126 * 6 = $756 for the second half of the year.

Adding it all up, she pays $840 + $756 = $1596 for the whole year.

"Okay, so there are 175 diamonds.  The treasure hunter found 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, which means there are 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.

Then, there were twice as many emeralds as rubies, so that's 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

Finally, to find the total number of gems, we add them all up: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems.

First, we need to figure out the inside dimensions of each box.  Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch on each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches (1 inch on each side) from the height.

* Inside Length: 5 inches - 1 inch - 1 inch = 3 inches
* Inside Width: 6 inches - 1 inch - 1 inch = 4 inches
* Inside Height: 4 inches - 1 inch - 1 inch = 2 inches

Now we can calculate the volume of one box:

* Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 inches x 4 inches x 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

"Okay, let's break this down:

* A watermelon costs 3 times the price of a pepper, which is $15, so a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.
* An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so it costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now let's calculate the total cost:

* Watermelons: 4 watermelons * $45/watermelon = $180
* Peppers: 20 peppers * $15/pepper = $300
* Oranges: 10 oranges * $40/orange = $400

Finally, add up the cost of each item: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"Okay, so the hospital sees 500 people a day, and each person is there for 24 minutes.  That means they spend a total of 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes with patients.

To figure out how many hours that is, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

The doctors make $150 an hour, so they earn 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges patients $200 an hour, so they make 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000 from the patients.

To find the profit, we subtract the doctors' earnings from the patient charges: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"Okay, so the price goes up by 20% every two months.  That means we need to figure out what happens to the price over 18 two-month periods (36 months / 2 months per period = 18 periods).

Here's how to think about it:

*  The price starts at $20.
*  After the first two months, it increases by 20% of $20, which is $4. So it's now $24.
*  After the next two months, it increases by 20% of $24, which is $4.80. So it's now $28.80.

We keep doing this for 18 periods.  A faster way to do this is to realize that the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20%) every two months.

"Okay, here's how to solve this:

*  First, we know the hamsters used 10 hamsters * 5 pieces/hamster = 50 pieces of straw.
*  Then, we can figure out how much straw the rats and rabbits used together: 160 total pieces - 50 pieces (hamsters) - 20 pieces (rabbits) = 90 pieces.
*  That means the rats used 90 pieces of straw, and since each rat gets 6 pieces, there are 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.
*  Finally, with 15 rats in 3 cages, there are 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say the small pool had *x* gallons of water 4 minutes ago.  That means the big pool had 2*x* gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, the small pool now has *x* - 16 gallons and the big pool has 2*x* - 16 gallons.

We know the big pool now has four times the amount of water as the small pool, so:

2*x* - 16 = 4(*x* - 16)

Let's solve for *x*:

2*x* - 16 = 4*x* - 64

"Okay, so the redwood is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.  That means there are 20 sections in total (200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections).

The whole tree would weigh 8000 pounds before the termites got to it (20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds).

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, they ate 2400 pounds (8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds).

That leaves the redwood weighing 5600 pounds (8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds).

"Okay, let's figure this out!

**Job A:**

* Nick makes $15 an hour and works 2000 hours, so he earns $15 * 2000 = $30,000 a year.
*  The state takes 20% of his pay in taxes, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000.
*  That means he takes home $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

* Job B pays $42,000 a year, but then he has to pay $6,000 in property taxes.
*  After that, he makes $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
*  The state takes 10% of what's left, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600 in taxes.
*  So, he keeps $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

**The Difference:**

* Job B pays more!  He makes $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400 more than Job A.

"Okay, so we have 200 students split into three groups.  Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the smallest group has 10 fewer students than those.

Let's say 'x' is the number of students in each of the bigger groups.  That means the smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

The total number of students is 200, so we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

So, each of the bigger groups has 70 students.  The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet.  There are 3 feet in every yard, so a 3-yard length is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Next, we can use the area to find the width.  The area of a rectangle is length times width, so:

360 square feet = 9 feet * width

Dividing both sides by 9 feet, we get:

width = 40 feet

Finally, we can calculate the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of the length and width:

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet

"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

* **Venue 1:** Costs $200 plus $5 per person for food.
* **Venue 2:** Costs $25 per person, and that includes food.

To find out when they cost the same, we need to set up an equation. Let 'x' be the number of guests:

* Venue 1 cost: $200 + $5x
* Venue 2 cost: $25x

Now we set them equal:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:

x = 10


**Answer:** 10 guests

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let's use variables:

*  Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
*  Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

We know:

* L + D + B = 43 
* L = D + 7
* D = B / 2

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplifying:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Dividing both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16



**Answer:** Lily found 16 insects.

Now, let's see how many sticks he gets from each:

* 6 2x4s * 200 sticks per 2x4 = 1200 sticks
* 4 2x8s * 400 sticks per 2x8 = 1600 sticks

So, Frederick can make the most popsicle sticks (1600) if he buys the 2x8s.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let 'n' be the nephew's current age.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

In 7 years, his nephew will be n + 7 years old.

We know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so:

"Okay, so Ashley's internet speed is 20 kilobits per second.  We need to figure out how many megabits that is per hour.

There are 1000 kilobits in a megabit, so first we divide her speed by 1000: 20 kb/second / 1000 kb/Mb = 0.02 Mb/second.

Then we need to figure out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say one triplet is 't' years old.  Since one twin is 7 years older than that triplet, the twin is 't + 7' years old.

The total age of all five kids is 44, so we can write the equation:

t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

Simplifying the equation:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:

t = 6

So, one triplet is 6 years old.  

To find the age of one twin, we add 7:

6 + 7 = 13

"Here's how to solve the problem:

First, figure out how many coins Neil saves each month:

* Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong.
* So Neil saves 20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins per month.

Now let's calculate their yearly savings:

* Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins per year.
* Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins per year.

Finally,  find their total savings after ten years:

* Rong saves 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.
* Neil saves 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Okay, let's figure this out. 

First, the vaccines cost $20 each, so two vaccines cost $20 * 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the vaccines make up the other 40%.  

Let's say the total bill is $x.  We know:

* 0.60x = cost of heartworm check
* 0.40x = cost of vaccines ($40)

Since we know the vaccines cost $40, we can solve for x:

* 0.40x = $40
* x = $40 / 0.40
* x = $100

John brought $125 and the bill was $100, so he has $125 - $100 = $25 left.

* The crate has 12 apples at $0.50 each, so that's 12 * $0.50 = $6.00.
* The crate has 7 oranges at $3.00 each, so that's 7 * $3.00 = $21.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Cost of the packs:** 3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400
* **Value of the two special cards:** $4000 + $1000 = $5000
* **Value of the other cards:** 30 cards * $50/card = $1500
* **Total value of all the cards:** $5000 + $1500 = $6500
* **Profit:** $6500 - $5400 = $1100

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out. 

Park 1 costs $26 per adult and $12 per child, and Park 2 costs $14 per adult and $10 per child.  

For Jake's family, that means:

* **Park 1:** (2 adults * $26) + (2 kids * $12) = $52 + $24 = $76
* **Park 2:** (2 adults * $14) + (2 kids * $10) = $28 + $20 = $48

To find out how much they save, we subtract the cheaper park's price from the more expensive one: $76 - $48 = $28


**Answer:** They'll save $28. 
"
"Okay, so he saves $0.10 on each tomato since the new price is $0.40 and the old price was $0.50.  

He sells 500 tomatoes a day, so he saves $0.10 * 500 = $50 each day.

Over a week, that's $50/day * 7 days/week = $350.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Carl's marbles:** Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, who has 56, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.
* **Cal's marbles:** Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.
* **Combined marbles:** Together, Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

"
"Okay, so they need to divide 54 students into 12 groups, and each group has to have the same number of students.  

First, figure out how many students are in each group: 54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group.  

Since you can't have half a student, this problem doesn't make sense in the real world!  




"
"Okay, so Candy rents out 60 chairs on weekdays and 100 on weekends.  There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

* Weekday rentals: 60 chairs/day * 5 days/week = 300 chairs/week
* Weekend rentals: 100 chairs/day * 2 days/week = 200 chairs/week
* Total weekly rentals: 300 chairs/week + 200 chairs/week = 500 chairs/week

That means in a month (4 weeks) she rents out: 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks/month = 2000 chairs

Over two months, she rents out: 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs

* Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
* Arnold steals half, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
* Gunther has 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
* He adds 25 more, so he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
* Arnold steals another 12, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
* Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, giving him a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

"
"Okay, let's break this sticker-button trade down:

* **Small stickers to large buttons:** Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is 27 stickers.  Since each large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

* **Large stickers to large buttons:** She trades half her 40 large stickers, which is 20 large stickers.  That means she gets 20 more large buttons.

* **Large stickers to small stickers:**  She has 20 large stickers left, which she trades for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

* **Total buttons:**  She started with 27 small buttons and got 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.  That's a total of 27 + 29 = 56 buttons.

"
"Okay, so there are 33 people on the council and twice as many votes for the regulation as against it.  

Let's say 'x' is the number of votes against the regulation.  That means there are 2x votes in favor.

Together, that's x + 2x = 33 votes.

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 11.

So, there were 11 votes against the regulation.  

Since there were twice as many votes for, there were 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor.

* **Large Shirts:** Half as many students need size large as size medium is 18 / 2 = 9 students.
* **Extra-Large Shirts:** Six more students need size extra-large than large is 9 + 6 = 15 students.
* **Total Shirts:** Add up all the sizes: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

"Okay, so here's how to solve this:

*  Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases of shingles.

* The first house needs half the shingles of the second, so it needs x/2 cases.

* The third house needs double the shingles of the first, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

*  Together, all three houses need 250 cases: (x/2) + x + x = 250

*  Combining like terms, we get 2.5x = 250

*  To find x, we divide both sides by 2.5: x = 100

*  Since the third house needs the same number of cases as the second house, it needs 100 cases.

"Okay, so Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series, which he can get for $6 each instead of $10. That's 600 / 3 = 200 series movies.  

The series cost him 200 * ($10 / 6) = $333.33.

The rest of his movies are 600 - 200 = 400.  Forty percent of those are older movies, so 400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies.

Those older movies cost him 160 * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies are 400 - 160 = 240, and those cost 240 * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up, the total cost is $333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33.

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

* Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought.
* Let 'o' represent the number of orange fish Bob bought.

We know:

*  o + w = 17 (The total number of fish he bought)
*  o = 2w (He bought twice as many orange fish as white fish)

We can use substitution to solve for 'w'.  Since we know 'o' is equal to 2w, we can substitute that into the first equation:

2w + w = 17

Combining like terms:

3w = 17

Dividing both sides by 3:

w = 5.67

Since Bob can't buy parts of fish, we round down to the nearest whole number.


**Answer:** Bob bought 5 white fish.

"Okay, so Andy's car gets 10 miles per gallon. That means for every gallon of gas, he can drive 10 miles.

He drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home each day, so that's 10 miles total per day.

Over a five-day work week, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles.

If his car gets 10 miles per gallon, he uses 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons of gas per week.

With gas costing $3 per gallon, that means he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 per week on gas.

"Okay, here's how to solve this:

*  First, find out how much tea the 16 students drank: 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts
*  Then, add the amount the other students drank: 32 quarts + (4 students * 1.5 quarts/student) = 32 quarts + 6 quarts = 38 quarts
*  Finally, add the tea that's left over to find the total amount at the beginning: 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

*  January: 10 * 2 = 20
*  February: 20 * 2 = 40
*  March: 40 * 2 = 80
*  April: 80 * 2 = 160
*  May: 160 * 2 = 320

*  So, there are 320 students at the end of May.

*  To find the additional students, subtract the starting number: 320 - 10 = 310

"Okay, so Felix made $105 all week, and each branch he climbs costs him $0.25.  To find out how many branches he climbed in total, we can divide his total earnings by the cost per branch: $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days: 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches/day.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Jack's friends:** They play for half as long as Jack, so they each get 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes of playtime per quarter.
* **The better friend:** This friend plays 1.5 times longer than Jack, meaning they get 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes of playtime per quarter.
* **Total playtime:** They play for 4 hours, which is 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.
* **Quarters used:**
    * Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters

"Okay, so Tanya makes this salt scrub, and she wants to fill a 10-ounce jar.  She uses the same amount of zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Let's figure out how much oil she uses.

*  Let's say 'x' is the amount of zest (and fragrance) she uses.
*  Since she uses the same amount of salt and sugar, they're also 'x' ounces.
*  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so she uses 2x ounces of oil.

Now we know:

* Zest: x ounces
* Fragrance: x ounces
* Salt: x ounces
* Sugar: x ounces
* Oil: 2x ounces

The total has to be 10 ounces, so:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms: 5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5: x = 2

Since oil is 2x, she uses 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil.

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say PJ has 'x' Magic Cards.  Smendrick has three times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7: x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  To find how many Becca has, we plug that back into our expression for Becca's cards:

3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153


**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

* Week 3: Three times week 1 is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Adding those up, he made 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars in the first three weeks.

To find out how many he made in week 4, we subtract that from his monthly total: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

And she does her makeup for 15 minutes each day for 6 days, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Adding all that up, she spends 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes on TikTok each week.

In a month with four weeks, that's 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

"Okay, so they charge $129 to hang 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  

Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures hung.  

That means she needs to pay extra for 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

* Extra mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15/mirror = $30
* Extra chandelier: 1 chandelier * $15/chandelier = $15
* Extra pictures: 10 pictures * $15/picture = $150

So the extra cost is $30 + $15 + $150 = $195

* Finally, Naruto lifts 10 times what Kagiyami can, so Naruto lifts 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

1. Since S = A + 25, we can rewrite the first equation as: (A + 25) + A + F = 85

2. Simplify: 2A + F + 25 = 85

3.  Substitute A = F - 12 into the equation: 2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

4. Simplify and solve for F: 2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85
                                         3F + 1 = 85
                                         3F = 84

*  The apples cost half the price of strawberries, so each pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2.
*  The total cost of the apples is 7 packs * $2/pack = $14.
*  The strawberries cost $4 per pack, so 3 packs cost 3 * $4 = $12.

*  Now let's add up the cost of everything: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Let's figure out how much she made mowing.  She mowed Joe's lawn some number of times (let's call that 'x'), and Kamala's three times that, and Alba's five times that.  So, her mowing earnings are:

* Joe: 6x 
* Kamala: 6 * 3x = 18x
* Alba: 6 * 5x = 30x

That means her total mowing earnings are 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x

To find out how much she made from lemonade, we subtract her mowing earnings from her total earnings:

$80 - 54x = Lemonade earnings

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100

* P = Pa + J

Let's substitute to solve for P:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the third equation:

   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:

"Okay, so they have 10 people donating 5 boxes each, which is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.  

Then they add their own 10 boxes, for a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

"Okay, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.  Each widget sells for $6.

First, let's figure out how many widgets each machine makes in a day:

* Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
* WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Now, let's see how much money each machine makes in a day:

* Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * $6/widget = $8640/day
* WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * $6/widget = $6480/day

Finally, let's see how much more the Widgeteer 3000 makes in a month (30 days):

* Widgeteer 3000: $8640/day * 30 days/month = $259,200/month
* WidgetMaster 9000: $6480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400/month

The difference is: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Cameron stays for 17 hours total (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day).  The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, so he'll pay an extra 5 hours at 70 pesos per hour. That's 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

So, his total cost is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

If he'd paid for the full 24 hours, it would have been 1600 pesos.

He saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Find the distance James swims.** 
   He swims 60% of 20 miles, so he swims 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

* **Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to swim the first part.**
   Time = Distance / Speed, so it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

* **Step 3: Figure out the resting time.**
   He rests for half the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* **Step 4:  Determine the remaining distance.**
   He has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to swim.

* **Step 5: Calculate the time to swim the rest.**
   He swims at half speed, so his speed is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.  It takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.  Since Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, Bahati scored 'x + 20' points.  Dinar scored 10 fewer than Azibo, so Dinar scored 'x - 10' points.

Together, their scores add up to 45:
x + (x + 20) + (x - 10) = 45

Combining like terms:
3x + 10 = 45

"This problem has a bit of a trick to it!  

It says the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.  That means we need to figure out how many holes were there at the end of the first day.

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

Let's use variables to represent the number of Pokemon each person caught:

*  A = Alex's Pokemon
*  S = Stan's Pokemon
*  W = Adelwolfe's Pokemon

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Now we can use substitution to solve for S.  Let's plug in the second and third equations into the first equation:

(S + 5) + S + (4W - 13) = 339

Simplify:

2S + 4W - 8 = 339

2S + 4W = 347

Now, substitute  'S = 4W - 13' into the equation:

2(4W - 13) + 4W = 347

8W - 26 + 4W = 347

12W - 26 = 347

12W = 373

W = 31.08 (approximately)

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught about 31 Pokemon, we can find Stan's catch:

S = 4W - 13

S = 4(31.08) - 13

S = 124.32 - 13

S = 111.32 (approximately)

So, that's 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches total.  Then we subtract the space between plants: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.  

That means Pat needs 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since you can't have half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

She already has 17, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

* **Cooking:** She cooks 30 shrimp every 10 minutes, meaning she cooks 3 shrimp a minute.  To cook 90 shrimp, it'll take her 90 / 3 = 30 minutes.

* **Total Time:**  It takes 15 minutes to peel and 30 minutes to cook, so the whole thing takes 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"Okay, here's how to solve this:

* **Cooling on low:** The air conditioner cooled the room 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.
* **Cooling on high:** It cooled it another 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.
* **Total cooling:**  That's a total of 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees cooler.
* **Warming up:**  With the AC off, the room warmed up 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.
* **Final temperature:** So the final temperature was 18 degrees cooler - 4 degrees warmer = 14 degrees cooler than the starting temperature.

"Okay, here's how to solve this:

* Let's say Bill was *x* years old when he first saw Halley's Comet.

* His dad was 30 when he saw it, and Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age, so he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

* Since Halley's Comet comes around every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.

* This means 90 - *x* = 75

*  Solving for *x*, we get *x* = 90 - 75 = 15

* Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
* Chikote howls twice as long as Tobias, so he howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* Together, Tobias and Chikote howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* Igneous howls for the same amount of time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
*  The total howl time for all three wolves is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
*  To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

*  Simplifying the equation: 4x + 4x = 6
*  Combining like terms: 8x = 6
*  Solving for x: x = 6/8 = 0.75 
*  So each adult gets 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.
*  To find the percentage, we do (1.5 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 25%

"Okay, so Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic.  He spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds, and he has 9 inpatients, so that's 20 minutes/inpatient * 9 inpatients = 180 minutes on rounds.

He also has 10 appointments that each take 30 minutes, so that's 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes for appointments.

In total, he spends 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes on rounds and appointments.

To figure out how many hours that is, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

Let's say the first person gets  'x' dollars.

* The second person gets x + $80.
* The third person gets 2(x + $80).

Since the total amount is $1920, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Simplifying the equation:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920
4x + $240 = $1920
4x = $1680
x = $420

"Okay, so they worked for 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks.  First, let's figure out the total number of days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Then, we multiply that by the fraction of a day they worked each day: 21 days * (3/8 day/day) = 7.875 days.

To get the total hours, we multiply that by 8 hours a day: 7.875 days * 8 hours/day = 63 hours.

Finally, we divide the total hours by the number of painters: 63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours/painter.

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say Rory got 'x' tennis balls in the second set.  

* The first set he got 'x + 4' balls.
* The third set he got 'x / 2' balls.

In total, he got 19 balls:  x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Let's solve for x:

1. Combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
3. Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, Rory got 6 balls in the second set.  

In the first set, he got x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

* Simplifying the equation, we get (1/15)x = 6
* To find x, we multiply both sides by 15: x = 6 * 15
*  Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs in total, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let Sarah's eggs be represented by 'y'. This means Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.
*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30

   Stacy found twice the number of eggs Lamar did, so she found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.

* **Step 3: Calculate how many eggs Charlie found.**
   Charlie found 2 fewer eggs than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

* **Step 4: Calculate how many eggs Mei found.**
   Mei found half the number of eggs Charlie did, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

* **Step 5: Calculate the total number of eggs found.**
   Add up the number of eggs each person found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

* **Step 6: Calculate the number of eggs remaining.**
   Subtract the total number of eggs found from the original number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say the yellow rope is 'y' centimeters long.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making it 4(y - 7) centimeters long.

Together, their lengths add up to 37 centimeters:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

* Rissa got three times as much as Ronnie, so she started with 3 * $5 = $15.

* Let's say they each gave 'x' dollars to their sister.

* Rissa had $15 and gave away 'x', leaving her with $15 - x.  We know this is 4/5 of her original amount: $15 - x = (4/5) * $15

* Simplifying the equation: $15 - x = $12

* Subtracting $15 from both sides: -x = -3

* Multiplying both sides by -1: x = $3

* Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* Thomas starts with 1000 dollars / 20 dollars per bill = 50 bills.
* He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.
* He uses half his bills to pay a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
* That means he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.
* Tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.
*  Finally, he converts them all to 5 dollar bills, so he has 60 bills * 5 dollars per bill = 300 dollars.

Since each 5 dollar bill is worth 5 dollars, he has 300 dollars / 5 dollars per bill = 60 five dollar bills.

"Okay, let's break this soccer problem down:

* **First Half:** Team A scores 4 goals, and Team B scores 2 fewer than that, so Team B scores 2 goals.

*  ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": c + 25 = (1/3)w

We have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.  Let's solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:

* w = 5c + 35

Now substitute that value of 'w' into the second equation:

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.
* The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4x.
* The total length of both pieces is 40 feet: x + 4x = 40
* Combine like terms: 5x = 40
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 8
* The longer piece is 4x, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.  Since she makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes in brownies, she makes 3c - 2 brownies.

In total, Carly makes c + (3c - 2) = 10 treats.

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10.  Adding 2 to both sides, we have 4c = 12.  Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find c = 3.

"Okay, so a manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40.  That means together they cost $35 + $40 = $75.  

They give you 20% off if you do both, so that's $75 * 0.20 = $15 off.  

So the manicure and pedicure together cost $75 - $15 = $60.

Then she wants nail art on each of her 10 fingers, and that's $3 per nail, so that's 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, add that to the cost of the manicure and pedicure: $60 + $30 = $90.

* **Let's use variables:** Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has, 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has, and 'M' represent the number of paintings Samantha has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  M = S - 12  (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)
    *  S = K + 8   (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
    *  M = 27      (Samantha has 27 paintings)

* **Solve for K (Kim's paintings):**

    1. Since we know M = 27, substitute that into the first equation: 27 = S - 12
    2. Solve for S: S = 27 + 12 = 39
    3. Now that we know S = 39, substitute that into the second equation: 39 = K + 8

"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson and he has 4 of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.

He gives a 25% discount to veterans, which is $80 * 0.25 = $20 off each lesson.  

That means he makes $80 - $20 = $60 per veteran lesson.

He has 2 veteran lessons, so he makes 2 * $60 = $120 from those.

In total, he makes $320 + $120 = $440 for the day.

Now we can calculate the total distance he drives: 50 km/hour * 72 hours = 3600 km.

Finally, to find the percentage of the distance to Texas he covered, we divide the distance he drove by the total distance to Texas and multiply by 100%: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100% = 60%

Each pack costs $2, so he'll spend $12 in total (6 * $2 = $12). 


**Answer:** $12

"Okay, here's how to figure that out:

* Frances makes $40 from the cupcakes (20 cupcakes * $2 each).
* She makes $40 from the cookies (40 cookies * $1 each).
* That means she made a total of $80 ($40 + $40).
* She spent $20 on the trays (5 trays * $4 each).
*  So, she has $60 left ($80 - $20).

"Okay, so the company makes 5000 chocolate bars each day and sells them for $2 a piece.  

To find out how much they make in two weeks, we need to figure out how many bars they make in two weeks first. There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days.

That means they make 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70000 bars in two weeks.

Finally, they sell each bar for $2, so they make 70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can use substitution to solve for 'c'.  

1. Solve the first equation for 'w':
   w = 20 - c

2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. Simplify and solve for 'c':
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5
