"Okay, let's break down this real estate flip!

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the renovations added $120,000 in value ($80,000 x 1.50 = $120,000).

So, the house is now worth $200,000 ($80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000).

Next, we add up Josh's total investment: the purchase price plus the renovation costs, which is $130,000 ($80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000).

Finally, subtract the investment from the final value to find the profit: $70,000 ($200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000).

"Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal.  

Here's how I figured that out:

* Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
* With 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed total.
* She's already given out 40 cups (15 + 25).
* So, she needs 60 - 40 = 20 cups more.

"Let's break this down!  Kylar's buying glasses in a pattern:

*  The first glass is $5.
*  Every other glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.

So, he's paying $5, $3, $5, $3, and so on.  

Since he wants 16 glasses, he'll have 8 pairs of these alternating prices.  Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

Multiply that by the number of pairs: 8 pairs * $8/pair = $64.

* Carla downloads 2 GB per minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

*  The restart interrupts her download at 40% completion, meaning she's downloaded 200 GB * 0.40 = 80 GB.

*  She has to start over, so she needs to download the remaining 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.

*  This will take another 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

*  Adding the initial download time and the restart delay, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **First leg:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    * He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    * He then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    * He has 4 hours for the return trip - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (slow speed) = 1.5 hours left.
    * In the remaining time, he drives at 80 mph, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

* **Total return distance:** 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

* **Final distance from home:** John traveled 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, so he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie began with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.

*  This means she had x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, or ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18



**Answer:** Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

*  So, 12 students must have chosen hip-hop!

*  Finally, to find the percentage of the whole class who chose hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100%: (12/20) * 100% = 60%

"As a financial analyst, I'd recommend considering the jewelry.  

Here's why:

* **Jewelry Appreciation:** The jewelry market is projected to appreciate by 2.5%, which translates to a potential profit of $125 on a $5,000 investment. 

* **Gadgets Market:** While the electronic gadgets market is also expected to rise, the projected 1.2% increase yields a smaller profit of $96 on an $8,000 investment.


The jewelry offers a higher percentage return on investment, making it the more profitable choice in this scenario.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

If their total age is 162, we can think of it like this: they share 18 parts (7 + 11) that add up to 162 years.

To find the value of one part, we divide the total age by the number of parts: 162 / 18 = 9.

Now we know each ""part"" represents 9 years.  Allen's age is 11 parts, so he is currently 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

"Let's break this down!  Each level of the sandcastle is half the size of the one below it.  Since the top level is 16 square feet, we can work our way up to find the size of each level:

* **Bottom Level:** 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* **Second Level:** 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* **Third Level:** 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Adding up the square footage of all the levels, we get 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

* **Test 2:**  He had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate, so he completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions.

* **Total Incomplete:**  In total, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete from the first test and 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete from the second test.

Adding those together, he left a total of 35 + 70 = 105 questions incomplete.

"Let's break this down.  

There are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual.  That means there are 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.

"Well, this is a classic beehive population problem!  

To figure out the number of worker bees, we need to understand the relationships between the different types of bees.  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.  

Let's use a little algebra to solve this:

* Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

We know:

* b = 2q 
* w = 2b
* q + b + w = 700

Substituting the first two equations into the third, we get:

q + 2q + 2(2q) = 700

Simplifying:

q + 2q + 4q = 700
7q = 700
q = 100

Now we can find the number of baby bees:

b = 2q = 2 * 100 = 200

And finally, the number of worker bees:

w = 2b = 2 * 200 = 400

"Let's figure this out!  We know Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, and the red chickens lay 3 eggs each while the white chickens lay 5.  

Let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens. We can set up two equations:

*  3r + 5w = 42  (Equation 1: Total eggs)
*  w = r + 2   (Equation 2: White chickens are 2 more than red)

Now, we can substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"To figure this out, we need to find the total distance Gary walks, which is the perimeter of the park.  

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.  So:

Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles) 
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
Perimeter = 15 miles

"Let's figure out which job offers Nick the higher net pay.

**Job A:**

*  Nick earns $15 per hour and works 2000 hours a year, so his gross income is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
*  With a 20% tax rate, his taxes are $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000.
*  His net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

*  Job B offers a fixed annual salary of $42,000.
*  After paying $6,000 in property taxes, his net income before income tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
*  With a 10% tax rate on his net income after property taxes, his income tax is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.
*  His net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

**Comparison:**

*  Job B offers a higher net pay of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

"Let's break this down!  

*  If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it this way: for every cow, there are two chickens. 
*  Together, they make up 60 animals.  To find out how many of each he has, we can use a little algebra. Let 'c' represent the number of cows. That means he has 2c chickens.
*  So, c + 2c = 60
*  Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60
*  Dividing both sides by 3, we find c = 20 cows.
*  That means he has 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's count the legs!

* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.

* He buys 40 gumballs.

First, we need to figure out how much he spent on gumballs: 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since he spent half his change on gumballs, he had $2.00 * 2 = $4.00 in change before buying gumballs.

This means he spent $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00 on candy.

The ratio 5:6 tells us that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  We know they have a total of 165 popsicles.  To find out how many more popsicles Sam has, we need to figure out how many popsicles each person has individually.

Think of the ratio as representing parts of a whole.  Since the ratio is 5:6, there are 5 + 6 = 11 parts in total.

Each part is worth 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles.

* Betty has 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles.

First, we need to figure out how much each employee earned in a month.  They work 40 hours a week at $15 an hour, so that's $15 * 40 = $600 per week.

Over a month with four weeks, that's $600 * 4 = $2400 per employee.

"Let's figure out how much potting soil Bob needs!

First, we need to find the volume of one raised bed:

* Volume = width x length x height
* Volume = 2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet
* Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil he needs is:

* Total volume = 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds
* Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Now, each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need:

* Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag
* Number of bags = 160 bags

Finally, each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be:

* Total cost = 160 bags x $12/bag
* Total cost = $1920

"Let's break down this card trick!  

There are 15 red cards, and that's 60% fewer than the green cards.  To find the number of green cards, we need to figure out what 100% would be.

"Let's break this insect-collecting problem down!

*  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects.
*  Lily was a bit of a bug enthusiast and found 7 more than David.
*  David, on the other hand, found half the number of insects Bodhi did.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's say:

*  B = the number of insects Bodhi found
*  D = the number of insects David found
*  L = the number of insects Lily found

We can write these equations based on the information given:

*  L + D + B = 43 
*  L = D + 7
*  D = B / 2

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplifying the equation:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Dividing both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

"Let's break this down.  If one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  

With 5 people, they'd paint 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 of the house each day.  

So, it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house.  Assuming an 8-hour workday, that's 2 days * 8 hours/day = 16 hours.

* **Jenna's chairs:** Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 22 chairs * 3 = 66 chairs.

* **Jenna's sofas:** Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, meaning she has 66 chairs - 2 = 64 sofas.

* **Total sofas:**  Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84 sofas.

* **Total chairs:** Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month, we can think of it this way:

*  Let 'x' represent the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

*  He saves 15x in the first half (15 days * x dollars/day).

*  He saves 30x in the second half (30 days * 2x dollars/day).

*  His total savings are 15x + 30x = $1125

Combining like terms, we get 45x = $1125.  

To find out how much he saves each day in the second half, we first need to find 'x'.  Dividing both sides of the equation by 45, we get:

x = $25

Now we know Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half.  In the second half, he saves twice that amount, so he saves $50 each day.

"Let's break this jelly bean problem down!  

First, we know there are 4500 jelly beans total.  Let's say 'b' represents the number of blue jelly beans.  

* Red jelly beans are 1% fewer than blue, so there are 0.99b red jelly beans.
* Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue, so there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

A tire's lifespan is often measured in rotations, not miles.  We know each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.  

Jeremy's car rotates its tires 725 times for every 2 miles driven.  That means in a month, with 400 miles driven, the tires rotate 400 miles * (725 rotations / 2 miles) = 145,000 rotations.

Over a year, that's 145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations.

"Let's figure this out!  We know there are 20 heads total and 70 legs.  Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2, we can set up a system of equations:

*  Let 's' represent the number of sheep
*  Let 'g' represent the number of geese

* Equation 1: s + g = 20 
* Equation 2: 4s + 2g = 70

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using substitution.  Let's solve Equation 1 for 'g':

g = 20 - s

Now, substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 2:

4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

"Helga's a real firecracker on the dance floor!  Let's break down those taps:

*  With her arms down, she's a blur, hitting 300 taps a minute with her right foot and 250 with her left, for a total of 550 taps per minute.
*  When she raises her arms, her speed slows to 200 taps per foot, making 400 taps per minute.

Over her 5-minute performance, that's:

*  3 minutes with arms down: 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps
*  2 minutes with arms up: 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps

Adding those together, Helga's got a grand total of 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps!

Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, we can calculate how many quarters each friend uses:

* Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* Weaker friends: 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters
* Better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters

Adding those up, they use a total of 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

"Let's break down this salt scrub recipe!  

*  We know Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  
*  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

To figure out how much oil she uses, let's think about it this way:

* If we let 'x' represent the amount of zest (and fragrance), salt, and sugar, we can express the oil amount as 2x.

Since the total jar is 10 ounces, we have the equation: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms: 5x = 10

Dividing both sides by 5: x = 2

Now we know x = 2 ounces.  

Since oil is 2x, Tanya uses 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.  

* Let your brother's age be ""b""
* Let your sister's age be ""s""
* Let your age be ""y""

We know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87

Combining like terms in the last equation, we get: 4b + y + s = 88

Substituting the first two equations into this, we have: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Simplifying: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation again: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

This simplifies to: 6b - 8 = 88

Solving for 'b': 6b = 96  =>  b = 16

Now, substitute 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

The strawberries cost $4 each, so 3 packs cost 3 * $4 = $12.

And the apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.  

Seven packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.

Adding up all the costs, we get $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Let Peter's age be represented by 'P', Paul's age by 'Pa', and John's age by 'J'.

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

We can use substitution to find Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. Substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50



Peter's age is 50.

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets/month
   * Earnings: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200/month

* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets/month

"Let's figure out how much hay Nate needs. 

Each goat eats 5 pounds of hay, and each sheep eats 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat eats.  Twice the amount a goat eats is 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds.  So, each sheep eats 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay.

Nate has 15 goats who each eat 5 pounds, so that's 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

He also has 12 sheep who each eat 7 pounds, so that's 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.

In total, Nate needs 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds of hay.

"Let's figure this out!  

*  Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
*  Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find out how many Pokemon Stan caught (S), we can use substitution:

1.  Since A = S + 5, we can substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
    (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2.  Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3.  We also know S = 4W - 13.  Let's substitute that into the simplified equation:
    2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

4.  Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
    8S + S + 13 = 1336

5.  Combine like terms:
    9S + 13 = 1336

"Let's break this down.  Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday, which is a decent start.  He really ramped it up on Friday, catching four times that amount, so 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.  Then on Saturday, he caught half of Friday's catch, meaning 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Adding up his total catch, we have 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.

"Let's figure this out!  To make sure Pat has enough room for all her flowers, we need to figure out how many plants she needs.  

First, we'll convert the flower bed length to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Then, we'll subtract the space needed between the plants: 1332 inches - (1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot) = 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

Now we can see how many plants will fit: 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't have half a plant, she needs 110 plants.

Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Finally, each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558 at the store.

* **Total cooling:**  In total, the air conditioner cooled the room by 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
* **Warming up:**  With the air conditioner off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.
* **Final temperature:**  So the final temperature was 18 degrees cooler - 4 degrees warmer = 14 degrees cooler than the starting temperature.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Comet Halley has an orbital period of 75 years.  That means it takes 75 years for it to complete one full trip around the sun.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30, and Bill saw it again when he was three times his father's age.  This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Since the comet returns every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.  To find out how old Bill was the first time he saw the comet, we subtract 75 from his age the second time: 90 - 75 = 15.

If each adult gets a slice twice as big as a kid's slice, we can think of it this way:

*  Let 'k' represent the size of one kid's slice.
*  Each adult gets 2k.

Since the watermelon is divided into 6 equal slices, we have:

4k + 2 * 2k = 6

Simplifying the equation:

4k + 4k = 6
8k = 6
k = 6/8 = 0.75

So, each adult gets 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

To find the percentage, we divide the adult's share by the total slices and multiply by 100%:

(1.5 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 25%

"Let's break this down.  We know there are 50 porcupines total, and 3/5 of them are female. That means there are 30 female porcupines.  

Since each female has 4 babies a month, in a year (12 months) they'll have 4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies each.

So, 30 females * 48 babies/female = 1440 babies born in a year.

* **Scenario 2: Regular Teacher**
   If the regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension. That means there's a 60% chance she'll expect the homework.

* **Scenario 3: Dog Ate My Homework**
   Even if there's no extension for the whole class, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher with the ""dog ate it"" excuse.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted each.  Since they painted the same amount, together they painted 2x eggs.

* Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs in total, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let's say Sarah painted 'y' eggs, meaning Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.

* We know  y + (y + 12) = 30.  Simplifying this equation, we get 2y + 12 = 30.

* Subtracting 12 from both sides, we have 2y = 18.

* Dividing both sides by 2, we find that Sarah painted y = 9 eggs.

*  This means Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

*  We also know that 2x (Arnold and Madeline's eggs) + 30 (Camden and Sarah's eggs) = 56 total eggs.

*  Substituting the known values, we get 2x + 30 = 56.

*  Subtracting 30 from both sides, we have 2x = 26.

*  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that Arnold painted x = 13 eggs.

*  Finally, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

First, we know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and takes 40 minutes to do so.  To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula:

*Speed = Distance / Time*

So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at this faster speed.  To find the time it takes her, we use the same formula:

*Time = Distance / Speed*

So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, to find the total time for her 3-mile walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's calculate the total fruit production of an avocado tree over its 10-year lifespan:

* **Year 5:** 50 fruits
* **Year 6:** 50 * 3 = 150 fruits
* **Year 7:** 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* **Year 8:**  A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so that's 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.  An 8-year-old tree produces 200 less than that, meaning it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
* **Year 9:** 0 fruits
* **Year 10:** 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits

**Total fruits:** 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = **2350 fruits**

"Let's break this problem down step by step.  

* We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  All three ropes together measure 37 centimeters.

Let's use variables to make it easier:

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplify and solve for 'y':

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Finally, find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

* **Equal giving:**  Both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their sister. Let's call this amount 'x'.

* **Rissa's remaining money:** After giving away 'x', Rissa has $15 - x left. We know this is equal to 4/5 of her original amount: $15 - x = (4/5) * $15

* **Solving for x:**
    * $15 - x = $12
    * -x = -3
    * x = $3

* **Ronnie's remaining money:** Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"Let's break down this soccer match!

In the first half, Team A scored 4 goals, and Team B scored 2 fewer than that, so they scored 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B really stepped up their game, scoring 4 times their first-half total, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.  Team A scored 1/4 the number of goals Team B scored in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up the goals from both halves, Team A scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

* **Statement 1:**  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""  This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

* **Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""  This gives us: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   3c + 75 = 5c + 35
   40 = 2c
   c = 20

* **Day 3 bandages used:** They used half a pack of 50 bandages, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
* **Total bandages used in 3 days:**  Adding up the bandages used each day, we get 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.
* **Total bandages before day 3:**  Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of day 3, they must have had 91 + 78 = 169 bandages before day 3.
* **Bandages from bulk packs on day 3:** They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, for a total of 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.

Next, the shoes:

* The shoes are 40% off their original $40 price, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.
* The final price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, Jake's total spending is $8 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $32.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out how many holes the dog digs in total.  It digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so that's 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Then, Nate fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new ones each night.  This means Nate makes a net progress of 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled per day.

Finally, to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by his daily progress: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Well, this is a classic problem!  To figure out how many chickens Farmer Brown has, we need to use a little bit of algebra. 

Let's say 'c' represents the number of chickens and 'w' represents the number of cows.  We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can solve for 'c' by using substitution.  Let's solve the first equation for 'w':

w = 20 - c

Now, substitute that value of 'w' into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5


Farmer Brown has **5** chickens.
