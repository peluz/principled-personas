"Okay, let's break down this house flipping scenario.  

First, we need to figure out the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value went up by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's break this download problem down:

* **Step 1: Initial Download Time** 
   If Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, a 200 GB file would take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

* **Step 2: Download Progress at Restart**
   The restart happens 40% of the way through, so that's 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes.

* **Step 3: Data Downloaded Before Restart**
   In those 40 minutes, she downloads 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

* **Step 4: Remaining Download Time**
   She has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

* **Step 5: Total Download Time**
   The remaining download takes 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

* **Step 6: Final Calculation**
   Adding the initial download time, restart time, and remaining download time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **First leg:** John travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    *  He spends 2 hours in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    *  He then drives 30 miles per hour for half an hour (0.5 hours), covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    *  He has 4 hours for the return trip, but has already used 2.5 hours, leaving 1.5 hours.
    *  In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.
    *  The total distance covered on the return trip is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

* **Final distance:**  Since he traveled 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

*  Then she sold 2 more at the red house.

*  That leaves her with x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners.

*  She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold (x - x/3 - 2) / 2.

*  We know she has 5 left over, so: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2) / 2 = 5

Now we can solve for x:

*  Next, see how many of those students chose jazz: 16 students * 25% = 4 students.

*  Finally, subtract the jazz dancers from the remaining students to find the hip-hop dancers: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students.

*  To find the percentage of hip-hop dancers out of the whole class, divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of students and multiply by 100%: (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%

Let's say she needs to walk the last 6 miles in 'x' hours.  Here's how to set up the equation:

* **Total Distance / Total Time = Average Speed**
* **12 miles / (1 hour + 1 hour + x hours) = 4 mph**

"Let's break this down.  We have two drinks, each with a different water content.  

* **Orange Drink:** 10 liters, two-thirds of which is water, so that's (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters of water.

* **Pineapple Drink:** 15 liters, three-fifths of which is water, meaning (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters of water.

Now, we lose 1 liter of the orange drink, which means we lose 1/3 of a liter of water from the orange drink (since it's two-thirds water).

* **Water lost:** (1/3) * 1 liter = 0.33 liters

Finally, add up the water from both drinks, accounting for the spill: 6.67 liters + 9 liters - 0.33 liters = 15.34 liters

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

The ratio 7:11 means that for every 7 years Darrell ages, Allen ages 11 years.

**2.  Set up a Combined Age Equation:**

Let 'x' represent the common factor in the ratio.  This means Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.  Their total age is 162, so:

Let's use a little algebra to figure this out.  Let 's' represent the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins, we know there are 's + 30' gold coins.

Together, the number of silver and gold coins equals 110:  s + (s + 30) = 110

Simplifying the equation: 2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2: s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins: 40 + 30 = 70

"Let's break down this beehive problem!

*  We know there are 700 bees in total.
*  There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.

To figure out the number of worker bees, we can use a little algebra:

* Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

We can set up these equations:

* b = 2q 
* w = 2b
* q + b + w = 700

Now, let's solve for 'w' (the worker bees):

1. Substitute '2q' for 'b' in the second equation: w = 2 * (2q) = 4q
2. Substitute '2q' for 'b' and '4q' for 'w' in the third equation: q + 2q + 4q = 700
3. Combine like terms: 7q = 700
4. Divide both sides by 7: q = 100
5. Now that we know q = 100, we can find 'b': b = 2q = 2 * 100 = 200
6. Finally, find 'w': w = 4q = 4 * 100 = 400

"Let's break this down.  We're dealing with exponential growth here, where the price increases by a percentage of the *current* price each period.

The price starts at $20 and increases by 20% every two months.  This means the price is multiplied by 1.20 every two months.

To find the price after 36 months, we can use the following formula:

*  Final Price = Initial Price * (1 + Growth Rate) ^ (Number of Periods)

In this case:

* Initial Price = $20
* Growth Rate = 0.20 (20%)
* Number of Periods = 36 months / 2 months/period = 18 periods

Plugging these values into the formula:

* Final Price = $20 * (1 + 0.20) ^ 18

"Let's break this down.  

There are 3 numbers on a standard six-sided die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). That means there's a 3 out of 6, or 1/2 chance, of rolling a number bigger than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row,  we need to think about the odds at each roll. There are 3 even numbers on the die (2, 4, and 6), so the chance of rolling one even number is 3 out of 6, or 1/2.  Since the rolls are independent, we multiply those probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Converting that to a percentage, we get (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

* **Growth over 10 years:**  Over a decade, that's 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 new trees.
* **Total before die-off:**  He starts with 50 and adds 80, giving him 50 + 80 = 130 trees.
* **Tree mortality:**  Sadly, 30% of his trees die, which is 130 * 0.30 = 39 trees.
* **Final count:**  After the losses, he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.  

* Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool had 4 minutes ago.
* Since the big pool had twice the water as the small pool then, it had 2*s* gallons.

After 4 minutes, both pools have lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

*  The small pool now has s - 16 gallons.
*  The big pool now has 2*s* - 16 gallons.

We're told the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool:

2*s* - 16 = 4(s - 16)

Let's solve for 's':

2*s* - 16 = 4*s* - 64
48 = 2*s*
s = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons four minutes ago.  Now it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

"Let's break this down.  A redwood that tall is likely to be quite massive.  

First, we figure out how many 10-foot sections are in the whole tree: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections.

Then, we calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites got to it: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Finally, we need to account for the 30% that the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds.

Subtracting that from the original weight gives us the final weight: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees.  Then, it takes 40% longer to reach 400 degrees, which is an extra 8 minutes (20 * 0.40 = 8).

"Let's break down this programmer payroll problem:

First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are.  Since they make up 2/5 of the total employees,  that's (2/5) * 100 employees = 40 junior programmers.

Now, we know there are 100 employees total and 40 are junior programmers, so there must be 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers earn $2000 per month, so the total salary for all junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers, meaning they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.  

The total salary for all senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, to find the total payroll for all programmers, we add the salaries of the junior and senior programmers: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

* **Profit:** Her profit per hour is her revenue minus her cost.  Since she makes $4 per hour and her cost is a one-time expense, her profit per hour is $4/hour.

"Let's break this problem down.  If Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, we can think of that 12.8 hectares as representing 2/5 of his original land.

To find the whole, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * x = 12.8

Where 'x' is the original amount of land.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12.8 * (5/2) 
x = 32 hectares

"Let's break this problem down.  We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 bumps.  

*  Camels have two humps, so if we let 'c' represent the number of camels, they contribute 2c bumps.
*  Dromedaries have one hump each, so 'd' dromedaries contribute 'd' bumps.

This gives us our equations:

*  c + d = 180  (total heads)
*  2c + d = 304 (total bumps)

We can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries) using a little algebra.  Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for 'c':

c = 180 - d

Now substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

"To figure this out, we need to think about how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make with her eggs and how many glasses fit on each tray. 

She has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.  Plus, she has 2 extra eggs, so that's 48 + 2 = 50 eggs total.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, she can make 50 / 5 = 10 glasses of eggnog.

And if each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"Let's break this problem down.  If the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can represent this with an equation:

*  House cost = 3 * Lot cost

We know the total cost of the house and lot is $120,000, so:

* Lot cost + 3 * Lot cost = $120,000

Combining like terms:

* 4 * Lot cost = $120,000

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:

* Lot cost = $30,000

Now we can find the cost of the house:

* House cost = 3 * $30,000 = $90,000

"Let's break this down.  Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April.  Since April has 30 days, he needs to figure out how much to save each day to reach his goal.

He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as the first half.  Let's say he saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half. That means he'd save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

Here's the equation to represent his savings:

15x + 30(2x) = $1125

Simplifying:

15x + 60x = $1125
75x = $1125
x = $15

So, Elvis needs to save $15 each day in the first half.  In the second half, he'll save twice that amount, or $30 per day.

To get 520 degrees in the oven, Maggie needs to set it to a lower temperature.  Let's call that temperature 'x'.  

We know:

x + (0.04x) = 520

Combining like terms:

1.04x = 520

Solving for x:

x = 520 / 1.04 
x = 500

"Let's break this down.  

Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less than that, so we need to calculate 30% of $76,000, which is (0.30) * $76,000 = $22,800.

Subtracting that from Herb's house price gives us Juan's house price: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Finally, to find the combined value, we add the two prices: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

"To figure out how much water Hannah needs, we need to know how many calories she burns in total.  

* Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she does it for 2 hours, so that's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

* Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she runs for 1 hour, so that's 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

*  In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, she needs 1600 / 200 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"As a lover of all things blue, I'm always fascinated by jelly bean ratios!  Let's break this down:

*  We know there are 4500 jelly beans total.
*  Let's say 'b' represents the number of blue jelly beans.
*  Red jelly beans are 1% fewer than blue, so there are 0.99b red jelly beans.
*  Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue, meaning there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

Now, we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b':

b = 4500 / 2.99 
b ≈ 1505 blue jelly beans

Now, let's find the number of green jelly beans:

1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520 green jelly beans

Finally,  subtract the number of red jelly beans to find the difference:

1520 - (0.99 * 1505) ≈ 1520 - 1490 = 30

* **Apples:** If 4 apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.  
* **Oranges:**  Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

* **Total Cost:** Five apples would cost $1.30 * 5 = $6.50, and five oranges would cost $1.10 * 5 = $5.50.

* **Final Price:**  Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00 in total.

"Let's calculate the total cost of Bill's truck.  

* The king cab upgrade adds $7,500 to the base price.
* Leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, so they add $7500 / 3 = $2500.
* Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, making them $2500 - $500 = $2000.
* The upgraded exterior light package is an extra $1500.

Adding all these costs together: $7500 + $2500 + $2000 + $1500 = $13500

"Let's break this down.  If Colorado City uses 40% of the Colorado River's water, and 80% of that is for industry, we need to find the percentage left for non-industrial use.

Think of it like this:

*  The city's total water usage is like a pie cut into 100 slices.
*  40% of that pie is allocated to the city, which is 40 slices.
*  Of those 40 slices, 80% are for industry, meaning 32 slices are used industrially.

*  That leaves 40 - 32 = 8 slices for non-industrial purposes.

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To figure out how much Bennet needs to charge per ear of corn, we first need to see how much money he'll make from the eggplants.  He's selling 20 eggplants at $3 each, so that's 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, he wants to make a total of $135, so he needs to make another $135 - $60 = $75 from the corn.

Since he has 25 ears of corn, he needs to sell each ear for $75 / 25 = $3.

* **Series Movies:**  Since he's getting series at a discount, we'll calculate the cost as if they were all regular movies and then subtract the discount. 200 movies * $10 = $2000.  Then, subtract the discount: $2000 - (200 * ($10/6)) = $2000 - $333.33 = $1666.67
* **Older Movies:** 40% of the remaining movies are older, so that's 0.40 * (600 - 200) = 160 movies.  The cost of these is 160 * $5 = $800
* **Remaining Movies:**  The rest of the movies are regular price: (600 - 200) - 160 = 240 movies * $10 = $2400

* **Hiking Distance:** They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 mph, covering a distance of 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

* **Driving Distance:** They spent 6 hours total on the trip minus 1.5 hours hiking, leaving 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours for driving.

* **Total Driving Distance:**  Driving at 50 mph for 4.5 hours means they covered 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

"Let's break down this video game scoring puzzle!

*  **Enemies:** Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so we can represent Emma's enemies as 'x' and Ava's as 'x + 8'.
*  **Berries:** Emma collects 'y' berries, and Ava collects 'y + 3'.
*  **Timer:** Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, so we'll use 'timer' to represent Emma's time.

Now, let's calculate their scores:

* **Emma's Score:** (x * 10) + (y * 5) + (timer * 30)
* **Ava's Score:** (x + 8) * 10 + (y + 3) * 5 + (timer - 4) * 30

To find the difference, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

[(x + 8) * 10 + (y + 3) * 5 + (timer - 4) * 30] - [(x * 10) + (y * 5) + (timer * 30)]

"Let's break this fish problem down!  

* Bob started with 4 white fish and 3 orange fish.
*  He wants twice as many orange fish as white fish after buying more.  
*  Let's say he bought 'w' white fish and 'o' orange fish.

We know:

*  w + o = 17 (He bought 17 fish total)
*  o = 2w (Twice as many orange as white)

We can use substitution to solve for 'w':

1. Since o = 2w, substitute '2w' for 'o' in the first equation: w + 2w = 17

2. Combine like terms: 3w = 17

3. Divide both sides by 3: w = 5.67

Since Bob can't buy parts of fish, he must have bought **5** white fish.

* Let your brother's age be ""b""
* Let your sister's age be ""s""
* Let your age be ""y""

We know:

* y = b - 3 
* y = s + 2
* Mom's age = 3b - 1

Combining like terms in the last equation: 4b + y + s = 88

Substituting the first two equations: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Simplifying: 5b + y - 5 = 88

Substituting 'y' from the first equation: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplifying and solving for 'b': 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16

* **Total hours rented:** He rents his car for 3 hours per rental, and does this 10 times a month, so that's 3 hours/rental * 10 rentals = 30 hours.
* **Total earnings:**  Multiplying his hourly rate by the total hours gives us $25/hour * 30 hours = $750.
* **Profit:**  His profit is his earnings minus his car payment: $750 - $500 = $250.

* She uses 2 yards of material for every 4 small masks, so that's 0.5 yards per small mask.

* She uses 2.25 yards for every 3 large masks, so that's 0.75 yards per large mask.

Now let's calculate the total material:

* Small masks: 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards
* Large masks: 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards

Finally, add the material for both types: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

"Let's break this problem down:

* Duncan is 60 years old now, so eight years ago he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

*  We know that 52 years ago, Duncan's age was twice Adam's age four years ago.  Let Adam's age four years ago be represented by 'x'.  This means: 52 = 2x

* Solving for x, we find that Adam's age four years ago was 52 / 2 = 26 years old.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

*  Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
*  Let Paul's age be represented by 'Pa'
*  Let John's age be represented by 'J'

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  (The total age is 100)
* Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages)

Using substitution, we can solve for Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. Substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50



**Peter's age is 50.**

*  Travel costs 50% more than that, so we need to find 50% of $400, which is (50/100) * $400 = $200.
*  Finally, we add that extra cost to the original supplies price: $400 + $200 = $600.

"Let's solve this Pokemon problem!  

* Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Let's use substitution to solve for S:

1.  Substitute (S + 5) for A and (4W - 13) for S in the first equation:
    (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
    2S + W = 334

3. Substitute (S + 13) / 4 for W:
    2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

4. Multiply both sides by 4:
    8S + S + 13 = 1336

5. Combine like terms:
    9S + 13 = 1336

6. Subtract 13 from both sides:
    9S = 1323

7. Divide both sides by 9:
    S = 147



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"To figure this out, we need to think about the total time spent watching.  Since each episode is 20 minutes and there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, we can set up a simple equation:

*  Let 'e' represent the number of episodes.

"Let's break down this bird's journey!

First, the bird flies 30 miles per hour for 10 hours southward, covering 300 miles.  Then, it flies 18 miles per hour northward for 2 hours, a total of 36 miles.  Finally, it flies another 22 miles per hour southward for 5 hours, covering 110 miles.

To find the total distance south, we add the distances from the first and third legs: 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.

Finally, we subtract the northward distance to find the net distance south: 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

"Let's figure out how much Pat will spend.  

First, we need to know how many plants she needs.  Her flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant needs 12 inches of space.  That means she needs 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches of space for the plants.  

She also needs 1.5 feet of space between each plant, which is 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.  So, the total space needed is 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

That means she needs 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't buy half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

She already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

"Let's break this down.  We're dealing with a price increase that compounds each year.  

Here's how to calculate the price after three years:

* **Year 1:** $120 * 0.05 = $6 increase, so the price is $126.
* **Year 2:** $126 * 0.05 = $6.30 increase, making the price $132.30.
* **Year 3:** $132.30 * 0.05 = $6.615 increase, resulting in a price of $138.915.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

* **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher** 
   There's a 50% chance Marcus has a substitute, who might not collect the homework. That means there's a 50% chance he doesn't have to turn it in.

* **Scenario 2: Regular Teacher**
   If the regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension. This means there's a 60% chance she'll expect the homework.

* **Scenario 3: Dog Ate My Homework**
   Even if there's no extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher.

To find the overall probability Marcus *has* to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the scenarios where he *doesn't* get out of it:

*  Substitute teacher is *not* there (50% chance) AND the regular teacher expects the homework (60% chance) = 30% chance

*  Regular teacher is there AND no extension AND he doesn't convince the teacher (60% * 80% = 48% chance)

Adding those probabilities together: 30% + 48% = 78%

So, 5 springs would create 3600 jellyfish/spring * 5 springs = 18000 jellyfish per hour.

Over four hours, they'd produce 18000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72000 jellyfish.

"Let's break this fence problem down!

*  Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence total.
*  Harry wants 60 feet *more* than Sam.

Think of it like this: if we let 'x' represent the amount of fence Sam gets, Harry gets 'x + 60'.  

Together, they have: x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms: 2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Finally, dividing both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Let's break down Marcel's bike sales:

* **BMX Price:** A BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB, which is $500, so a BMX is $500 / 2 = $250.

* **Bike Counts:**
    * Trekking: Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking, so he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.
    * BMX: 15% of the bikes were BMX, meaning he sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.
    * MTB:  The rest were MTBs: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

* **Total Earnings:**
    * Trekking: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
    * BMX: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
    * MTB: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

"To figure out the cost of painting, we need to know the total area of the walls.

* The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so they total 80 square feet (5 * 8 * 2 = 80).

That means the total area of all the walls is 240 square feet (160 + 80 = 240).

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, you'll need 12 gallons (240 / 20 = 12).

At $12 per gallon, the total cost will be $144 (12 * 12 = 144).

"Let's break this problem down step by step.  

*  Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
* Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, Madeline also painted 'x' eggs.
* Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let's say Sarah painted 'y' eggs, so Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.

We can set up an equation:  x + x + y + (y + 12) = 56

Simplifying the equation: 2x + 2y + 12 = 56

Further simplification: 2x + 2y = 44

We also know that y + (y + 12) = 30

Combining like terms: 2y + 12 = 30

Solving for 'y': 2y = 18, so y = 9

Now we can substitute the value of 'y' back into the equation 2x + 2y = 44:

2x + 2(9) = 44

2x + 18 = 44

2x = 26

x = 13

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understand the Ratio:** The ratio 5:9 means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women on the bus.

* **Calculate the Unit Value:**  Since there are 84 total passengers, we need to figure out how many passengers each part of the ratio represents.  We can do this by adding the ratio parts: 5 + 9 = 14.  Then, divide the total passengers by the sum of the ratio parts: 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers per part.

* **Find the Initial Number of Women:**  Multiply the unit value by the women's ratio part: 6 passengers/part * 9 parts = 54 women.

* **Subtract the Women Who Alight:**  Subtract the number of women who got off the bus: 54 women - 20 women = 34 women.

"Let's break this down.  Adam's starting with a cool $100, which he's going to use to buy rocks.  He can get 20 rocks for that amount ($100 / $5 per rock = 20 rocks).

He plans to sell these rocks for $7 each, but only manages to sell 60% of them. That means he sells 12 rocks (20 rocks * 60% = 12 rocks).

His total earnings from selling the rocks are $84 ($7 per rock * 12 rocks = $84).

Since he started with $100 and only made $84, he loses $16 ($100 - $84 = $16).

* 6y = 72
* y = 12

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Rissa received three times the amount Ronnie did, so she started with 3 * $5 = $15.

Since they both gave the same amount to their sister, let's call that amount 'x'.  Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount, which means:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides:

-x = -3

Finally, multiplying both sides by -1:

x = $3

This means each of them gave $3 to their sister.  

Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"Let's solve this problem!

*  If the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we can represent this with the equation:  longer piece = 4 * shorter piece

*  We know the total length of both pieces is 40 feet, so: shorter piece + longer piece = 40 feet

*  Let's substitute '4 * shorter piece' for 'longer piece' in the second equation: shorter piece + 4 * shorter piece = 40 feet

*  Combining like terms, we get: 5 * shorter piece = 40 feet

*  To find the length of the shorter piece, divide both sides by 5: shorter piece = 8 feet

* **Year 1:**  A 30% depreciation means the boat loses $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 in value, leaving it worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

* **Year 2:**  Another 30% depreciation on the reduced value: $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

* **Year 3:**  Finally, a 20% depreciation: $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  The boat's final value is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to find the total length of the fence.  That's called the perimeter.  

Think of it like this:  Imagine walking all the way around the fence. The perimeter is the total distance you'd cover.

Since the fence is a rectangle, we can use this formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

James' fence is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, so:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 35 feet = 70 feet
