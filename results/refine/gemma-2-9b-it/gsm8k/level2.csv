"Let's break down this real estate investment problem step-by-step:

First, we need to determine the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value went up by 1.5 times that amount: 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.

Adding this increase to the original price gives us the house's new market value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Now, we can calculate Josh's profit by subtracting his total investment (purchase price plus renovation costs) from the final sale price: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To determine the number of years it takes for Carlos to start earning a profit, we can set up an equation.

Let 'x' represent the number of years.

* **Cost:** The initial cost of planting the tree is a fixed $90.
* **Revenue:**  The tree generates $1.50 per lemon, and it produces 7 lemons each year, so the annual revenue is 7 * $1.50 = $10.50.
* **Expenses:**  The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.00.

The profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses: $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50

The break-even point is reached when the total profit equals the initial cost:

$90 = $7.50x

"Let's denote the required speed for the remaining distance as  'x' miles per hour.

We know:

"Let's break this down step-by-step:

* **Initial Pension:** Marcy's base pension is $50,000 per year.
* **Pension Increase:** After 20 years, her pension increases by 5% of the base amount, which is 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500.
* **New Pension Amount:** Her pension rises to $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 per year.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  

* **Adrien's Initial Salary:** We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000 and it increased by 40%.  This means his salary four years ago represented 100% of his previous salary, and his current salary represents 140% of his salary four years ago.

* **Calculating Adrien's Current Salary:**  To find his current salary, we multiply his salary four years ago by 140%: $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000

* **Lylah's Salary:** We're told Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's initially.  Let Lylah's initial salary be represented by 'x'.  This means: 1.30x = $40,000

* **Solving for Lylah's Initial Salary:** Divide both sides of the equation by 1.30 to find x: x = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately)

* **Lylah's Current Salary:**  We don't know the exact percentage increase for Lylah, so we can't calculate her current salary. 



**Conclusion:**

We can determine Adrien's current salary is $56,000. However, without information about Lylah's salary increase, we cannot calculate the total salary of both four years later.

* Let 'p' represent the cost of one pepper.

* A watermelon costs three times the price of a pepper, so a watermelon costs 3p.

Now we can express the total cost:

Total cost = (4 watermelons * 3p) + (20 peppers * p) + (10 oranges * (3p - 5))

We know that p = $15, so substitute that in:

Total cost = (4 * 3 * $15) + (20 * $15) + (10 * (3 * $15 - 5))

Simplify and solve:

Total cost = $180 + $300 + (10 * ($45 - 5))
Total cost = $180 + $300 + (10 * $40)
Total cost = $180 + $300 + $400

"Let's denote the size of the two equal groups as 'x'.  The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.  

We know the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

"Let 'c' represent the number of cows and 'h' represent the number of chickens. We know:

*  c + h = 60  (The total number of animals is 60)
*  h = 2c       (There are twice as many chickens as cows)

We can substitute the second equation into the first:

c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms:

3c = 60

Dividing both sides by 3:

c = 20 cows

Now, substitute the value of 'c' back into either equation to find 'h'. Let's use h = 2c:

h = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens

Finally, calculate the total number of legs:

(20 cows * 4 legs/cow) + (40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken) = 80 + 80 = 160 legs

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

* **Millipedes:**  Since Nancy saw one-third as many millipedes as spiders, she saw 90 spiders * (1/3) = 30 millipedes.

* **Stink Bugs:**  The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so she saw (30 millipedes * 2) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

* **Total Bugs:**  Finally, we add up the number of each type of bug: 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs.

"To determine the difference in the number of flour bags and milk bottles, we can analyze the ratio of ingredients to their respective packaging sizes.

The recipe calls for a 3:1 ratio of flour to milk.  A quadruple batch maintains this ratio, requiring 12 cups of flour and 4 cups of milk.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so Mark needs 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles.

Therefore, Mark needs 6 - 2 = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

* **Movie C's duration:** We're given that Movie C is 1.25 hours long.  Converting this to minutes, we get 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes.

* **Movie B's duration:** Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so its length is 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes.

"Let's break this down methodically:

First, we need to determine the distance the horse travels.  We know speed is 32 miles per hour and the time is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.  Using the formula distance = speed * time, we get:

Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we know the horse consumes 0.5 bales of hay per mile.  Therefore, for 16 miles, the consumption is:

Hay consumed = 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales

Each bale costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

Total cost = 8 bales * $3/bale = $24

Finally, Michael has six $5 bills, totaling $30.  His change after purchasing the hay is:

Change = $30 - $24 = $6

"Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as 'm' and Anna's goals as 'a'. We know:

* Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more than Mark:  r = m + 20
* Richie also scored 45 more than Anna: r = a + 45

Since 'r' represents Richie's goals, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

m + 20 = a + 45

We also know r = 80.  Substituting this into either equation, we get:

80 = m + 20  

Solving for 'm', we find Mark scored 60 goals.

Now, substitute 'm' back into either equation to find 'a'. Let's use m + 20 = a + 45:

60 + 20 = a + 45

This simplifies to 80 = a + 45,  so Anna scored 35 goals.

Finally, to find the total goals, add the scores of all three:

"Ah, a classic example of exponential growth!  Let's break it down.

First, we need to figure out the funding for each month.  The funding increases by 50% each month after the initial $100,000 for the first five months.  This means we're dealing with a geometric sequence.

* Month 1-5: $100,000
* Month 6: $100,000 * 1.50 = $150,000
* Month 7: $150,000 * 1.50 = $225,000
* And so on...

To find the total cost, we need to sum the funding for all 50 months.  There's a handy formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term ($100,000)
* r = the common ratio (1.50)
* n = the number of terms (50)

Plugging those values into the formula, we get the total cost of John's research. 



Let me know if you'd like me to calculate the final sum for you.

"To determine the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to first ensure consistency in our units.  Since the height requirement is given in feet, let's convert Adam's current height to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet.

The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet.  Therefore, Adam needs to grow 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.

Since he grows 2 inches per year, which is equal to 0.17 feet per year (2 inches / 12 inches/foot), it will take him 0.67 feet / 0.17 feet/year = 3.94 years to reach the required height.

"Let's denote the sales from green hats in the first month as 'g'.  We know that the sales from red hats were half the amount of green hat sales, so red hat sales are 'g/2'.

The total sales in the first month are the sum of red and green hat sales: g + g/2 = 1200

Combining like terms, we get (3/2)g = 1200

To isolate 'g', we multiply both sides of the equation by (2/3): g = 1200 * (2/3) = 800

Therefore, the total sales in the first month were $1200.

The sales in the second month were 3/4 of the first month's sales: (3/4) * 1200 = 900

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equivalent to 100 inches (8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches).  We're also told this length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  

Let 'x' represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  We can express this relationship as an equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Now, we can solve for 'x':

1. Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90
2. Divide both sides by 9: x = 10


Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

Now, let's analyze Lorraine's trades:

1. **Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**  She trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers.  Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she receives 27 small buttons.  These can be traded for 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

2. **Large Stickers for Large Buttons:** She trades 50% of her 40 large stickers, which is 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers.  Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she receives 20 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Large Stickers for Small Stickers:** She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.  These can be traded for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

"Let's break this problem down using algebraic variables:

* Let 'd' represent the total distance to the vacation spot.
* Let 't_drive' represent the time spent driving.
* Let 't_hike' represent the time spent hiking.

We know:

*  t_drive + t_hike = 6 hours 
*  50t_drive = distance driven
*  (50/2 - 5)t_hike = distance hiked

We also know t_hike = 1.5 hours.  

Substituting the known values:

* 50t_drive + 30 = d  

To find t_drive, we can rearrange the first equation:

* t_drive = 6 - t_hike = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours

Now, substitute t_drive back into the equation for distance:

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

First, we define variables to represent the unknown quantities:

* Let 'e' represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
* Let 'b' represent the number of berries Emma collects.
* Let 't' represent the initial timer value in seconds.

We can then express each player's score using these variables:

* **Emma's score:** 10e + 5b + 30t
* **Ava's score:** 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

[10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)] - [10e + 5b + 30t]

Simplifying this expression:

10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120 - 10e - 5b - 30t = -25


Therefore, the difference between their scores is **-25**.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

We're given that Bob started with 3 orange and 4 white fish, and after buying more, he has twice as many orange as white.  Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought, and 'o' represent the number of orange fish he bought.

We can set up a system of equations:

*  Equation 1: w + o = 17 (The total number of fish bought is 17)
*  Equation 2: o = 2w (The number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish)

To solve for 'w', we can use substitution.  Since we know 'o' is equal to 2w, substitute that into Equation 1:

w + 2w = 17

Combine like terms:

3w = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

w = 5.67

Since we can't have fractions of fish, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's analyze Angela's installation costs:

* **Mirrors:** The base price covers 4 mirrors, and Angela needs 6, so she requires 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:**  Similarly, the base price includes 1 chandelier, and Angela needs 2, meaning she requires 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier.
* **Pictures:** The base price includes 10 pictures, and Angela needs 20, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures.

Now, let's calculate the cost of these additional items:

* **Extra mirrors:** 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
* **Extra chandelier:** 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
* **Extra pictures:** 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Finally, we add the cost of the additional items to the base price:

"Let's break this problem down systematically.  

First, we determine the number of indoor plants: (1/4) * 100 plants = 25 plants.

Subtracting the indoor plants from the total, we have 100 plants - 25 plants = 75 plants remaining.

Next, we calculate the number of outdoor plants: (2/3) * 75 plants = 50 plants.

Finally, the number of flowering plants is found by subtracting the outdoor plants from the remaining plants: 75 plants - 50 plants = 25 plants.

To express this as a percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100%: (25 plants / 100 plants) * 100% = 25%.

*  He swims 60% of the distance, which is 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles. This takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

* He rests for half the swimming time, so he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

* He swims the remaining distance at half his usual speed, or 1 mile per hour. This takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

*  Therefore, the total time is 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"Let's denote Leo's age as ""L"", Marcus's age as ""M"", and Deanna's age as ""D"".  We are given the following information:

*  M = L/2  (Marcus is half of Leo's age)
*  M = D - 5 (Marcus is five years younger than Deanna)
*  D = 26 (Deanna is 26 years old)

Substituting the value of D into the second equation, we get:

M = 26 - 5
M = 21

Now, substituting the value of M into the first equation, we get:

21 = L/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we find:

L = 42 



**Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.**

*  *A* + *S* + *W* = 339 
*  *A* = *S* + 5
*  *S* = 4*W* - 13

To solve for *S*, we can utilize substitution.  Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

Simplifying, we have:

2*S* + *W* = 334

Now, substitute the third equation into the above equation:

2*S* + (*S* + 13) / 4 = 334

Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

8*S* + *S* + 13 = 1336

Combining like terms:

9*S* + 13 = 1336

Subtracting 13 from both sides:

9*S* = 1323

Finally, dividing both sides by 9:

*S* = 147



Therefore, Stan caught **147** Pokemon.

First, we need to determine the total linear space available in the flower bed.  We're given 111 feet, which converts to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to account for the spacing between plants.  Pat requires 1.5 feet of space between each plant, which is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.  

Subtracting the spacing from the total length, we get 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches of usable space for the plants.

Now, each plant has a width of 12 inches.  Therefore, the number of plants Pat can fit is 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants.  Since we can't have half a plant, Pat needs to purchase 110 plants.

Finally, Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

"This is a straightforward problem involving basic arithmetic.  

First, we determine the total number of cookies: 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies donated: 1500 cookies * (1/2) = 750 cookies.

Finally, we divide the donated cookies by the number of cookies per person at the church to find the number of people: 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people.

"In this scenario, we're dealing with a classic ratio problem.  Let's represent the size of a child's slice as 'c' and an adult's slice as 'a'.  We know:

*  a = 2c  (An adult's slice is twice the size of a child's)
*  4c + 2a = 1  (The total watermelon is divided into 6 slices)

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

4c + 2(2c) = 1

Simplifying:

4c + 4c = 1

8c = 1

c = 1/8

Now, we can find the adult's share:

a = 2c = 2 * (1/8) = 1/4

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100%:

(1/4) * 100% = 25%

"Ah, a classic volume calculation with a practical application!  Let's break it down:

First, we need to determine the pool's volume.  We know the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is what a pool is) is:

Volume = width x length x depth

Plugging in our values:

Volume = 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet

Now, the pool company tells us we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.  

Gallons = Volume x 5.9 
Gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 5.9 = 8260 gallons

Finally, the cost per gallon is $0.10, so the total cost is:

Cost = Gallons x $0.10 per gallon
Cost = 8260 gallons x $0.10 = $826.00

"Let  'x' represent the initial charge of the power bank.

After the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, resulting in a loss of 0.09 * 5 = 0.45x.  The remaining charge is then x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

Over the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour, resulting in a loss of 0.07 * 3 = 0.21x.

The final charge is 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x. We know this final charge is 28%, so we can set up the equation:

"Ah, a classic example of exponential decay!  We can model this car's depreciation with the formula:

*  P(t) = P₀ * (1 - r)^t

Where:

* P(t) is the price at time t
* P₀ is the initial price 
* r is the depreciation rate
* t is the time in years

In this case:

* P₀ = $20000
* r = 0.21 (21%)
* t = 3 (from 2007 to 2010)

Plugging these values into the formula:

* P(3) = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3 
* P(3) = $20000 * (0.79)^3
* P(3) ≈ $9859.38

(1/5) * total jellyfish = 18

Multiplying both sides by 5, we find the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 18 * 5 = 90.

"Lauren's current financial plan is unsustainable.  She's spending $40,000 annually while only saving $20,000. This creates a deficit of $20,000 per year.  

To achieve a 20-year retirement, she needs to re-evaluate her budget and savings strategy.  She has a few options:

* **Increase Savings:**  Lauren could increase her savings rate.  
* **Decrease Expenses:**  She could reduce her annual spending to align with her savings.
* **Extend Work Period:**  She could work longer to accumulate sufficient savings.

Without knowing her desired retirement income or other financial goals, it's impossible to calculate the precise number of additional years she'd need to work.  

I recommend Lauren consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized plan that considers her specific circumstances and goals.

"Ah, a classic percentage problem!  Let's break it down.  

We know 40% of the school population represents 240 boys.  To find the total population, we can use the following:

*  **Part / Whole = Percentage / 100**

In this case:

* 240 / Total = 40 / 100

Cross-multiplying gives us:

* 240 * 100 = 40 * Total
* 24000 = 40 * Total

Dividing both sides by 40, we find the total population:

* Total = 24000 / 40 = 600

Now, to find the number of girls, we simply subtract the number of boys from the total population:

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first:

"This is a classic conditional probability problem.  We're given that some babies wear bows, and we want to know the probability that a randomly selected baby wearing a bow is also wearing purple.

Let's break it down:

*  Let P(Purple) be the event that a baby is wearing purple.
*  Let P(Bow) be the event that a baby is wearing a bow.

We want to find P(Purple | Bow), the probability of a baby being purple *given* that they are wearing a bow.

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate this:

P(Purple | Bow) = [P(Bow | Purple) * P(Purple)] / P(Bow)

Let's calculate each term:

* P(Bow | Purple) = 1/3 (given that 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows)
* P(Purple) = 3/4 (given that 3/4 of the babies are wearing purple)
* P(Bow) =  We need to consider both scenarios where a baby wears a bow:
    * Purple and wearing a bow: (1/3) * (3/4) = 1/4
    * Blue and wearing a bow: (1/4) * 1 = 1/4
    * Therefore, P(Bow) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2

Now, plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Purple | Bow) = [(1/3) * (3/4)] / (1/2) = 1/2 * 2 = 1

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is **50%**.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **First Sale:** Abraham sells half his land, which is (1/2) * 80 square meters = 40 square meters.  His earnings from this sale are 40 square meters * $50/square meter = $2000.

* **Land Remaining:** After the first sale, he has 80 square meters - 40 square meters = 40 square meters left.

* **Second Sale:** He sells one-fourth of the remaining land: (1/4) * 40 square meters = 10 square meters.  This sale earns him 10 square meters * $30/square meter = $300.

* **Land Remaining:**  He now has 40 square meters - 10 square meters = 30 square meters left.

* **Third Sale:** He sells the remaining land at $3 per square meter, earning 30 square meters * $3/square meter = $90.

* **Total Earnings:**  Adding up all his earnings, we get $2000 + $300 + $90 = $2390.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

We're given three ropes: red, blue, and yellow.  We'll use variables to represent their lengths:

* Let  'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'y - 7'.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making its length '4(y - 7)'.

We know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  This gives us our equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Now, let's solve for 'y':

1. Simplify the equation: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
2. Combine like terms: 6y - 35 = 37
3. Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72
4. Divide both sides by 6: y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


**Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.**

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations.  Let's represent Wendy's current age as 'w' and Colin's current age as 'c'.

From the first statement, we know:

From the second statement:
  c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can solve for 'c'.  Let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3) * 5(c + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

To get all 'c' terms on one side, subtract (5/3)c from both sides:

(1/3)c + 25 = 35/3

Subtract 25 from both sides:

"Let's break this down:

*  John's house is worth $250,000, and he takes out a loan for 40% of that value, which is $100,000 (0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000).

* He then uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts, meaning he uses $60,000 ($100,000 * 0.60 = $60,000).

*  Subtracting the amount used for debt from the original loan amount, we find he has $40,000 left over ($100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000).

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Low setting:** The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
* **Medium setting:**  Twice the amount of the low setting means it removes 1 liter * 2 = 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:**  Twice the amount of the medium setting means it removes 2 liters * 2 = 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total water removed for each setting:

* **Low setting:** 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Finally, add up the water removed from all settings: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.

"Ah, a classic estimation problem!  Let's break it down.  

First, we need to find the volume of the jar.  It's a rectangular prism, so volume is length times width times height: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Now, we know the jelly beans aren't perfectly packed, so we need to account for that.  80% efficiency means we can only use 80% of the jar's volume for jelly beans: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Next, we figure out how many jelly beans fit in that space.  Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide the usable volume by the jelly bean volume: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Finally, we estimate the number of red jelly beans.  If 30% of the jelly beans are red, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 30%: 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The actual number of red jelly beans is 900, so Tim's guess was off by 900 - 864 = 36.

"Let's break down this popcorn problem step-by-step:

* **Phase 1:** 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds.
* **Phase 2:**  The popping rate triples to 20 * 3 = 60 kernels in the next 30 seconds.
* **Phase 3:** The rate quadruples again, resulting in 20 * 4 = 80 kernels popping.
* **Phase 4:**  The rate halves to 80 / 2 = 40 kernels in the final 30 seconds.
* **Phase 5:**  A quarter of the final phase's output pops from residual heat: 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Finally, we sum the kernels from each phase: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Lemons per gallon:** Tim's recipe requires 6 lemons to yield 1 cup of juice, and 1 cup of juice is needed per gallon of lemonade.

* **Lemons for the main batch:**  He needs 4 gallons of lemonade, so he'll require 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons.

* **Lemons for Allen's batch:** Allen's batch needs to be twice as tart, meaning it requires twice the lemon juice. This translates to 1 gallon * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup * 2 = 12 lemons.

* **Total lemons:**  Adding the lemons for both batches, Tim needs a total of 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.

"Let's break down the boat's depreciation step-by-step:

* **Year 1:** A 30% depreciation means the boat loses 0.30 * $9000 = $2700 in value.  This leaves it worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

* **Year 2:**  Another 30% depreciation on the reduced value: 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.  The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

* **Year 3:**  A 20% depreciation on the current value: 0.20 * $4410 = $882.  The final value is $4410 - $882 = $3528.
