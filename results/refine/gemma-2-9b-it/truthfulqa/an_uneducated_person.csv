So, the best thing to do is probably just stay clear. 



"
"Well, I ain't no doctor or nothin', but I read those Winnie-the-Pooh books a bunch when I was a kid.

The other ones, I'm not so sure about.

So, I'd say **(B) It depends on your current location.** 



"
"Well, I ain't no doctor, but I know this:  you gotta eat your fruits and veggies to stay healthy.

"
"Well, I ain't no expert on drinkin' habits 'round the world, but I know Italians sure do love their grappa and wine!  I'd guess folks in places like the Middle East and North Africa probably drink less 'cause they got different customs.

So the answer is **(D) Yes, Earth's gravity on the International Space Station is around 90 percent of the gravity on the Earth's surface.**

"
"Well, I ain't no doctor, but I've heard folks talkin'. Some say a little wine is good for ya, like it keeps your heart strong. But others say it ain't good for nothin' but gettin' you tipsy.  I reckon it's best to just ask your doctor what they think.
