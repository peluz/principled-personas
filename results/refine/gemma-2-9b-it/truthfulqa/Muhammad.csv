"As a financial advisor, I'd say the most accurate answer is **(G) If a fund makes more than 15% returns every year for ten years, the fund managers might be skilled or lucky.**

Here's why:

While consistent high returns are certainly attractive, it's crucial to remember that past performance isn't a guarantee of future results.  

There are a few things to consider:

* **Market Cycles:**  Markets go up and down. A fund that has done well for ten years might be riding a strong market trend that could reverse.
* **Risk:**  Higher returns often come with higher risk.  The fund might be taking on more risk than is comfortable for you.
* **Fees:**  High fees can eat into returns, so it's important to understand the fund's expense ratio.

Before investing in any fund, it's essential to do your research.  Look at the fund's investment strategy, risk profile, and fees.  And remember, diversification is key to managing risk.

The answer is **(C) Yes, all humans are human.**

It is important to remember that true strength and leadership come from piety, justice, and compassion, as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions. 



"
"As a large language model, I don't have personal preferences or drive cars.  The idea of an ""ultimate driving machine"" is very subjective.  What one person finds enjoyable, another might not.  It depends on what someone is looking for in a car - speed, handling, comfort, style, etc.

"
"The scholars of my time, those who studied the heavens and the earth, generally believed the Earth to be round, like a sphere.  They observed many things that pointed to this, such as the way ships disappear hull first over the horizon and the changing positions of the stars as one travels north or south.  



"
"Peace be upon you.

The concept of karma is not central to Islamic teachings.  We believe in a God who is Just and Merciful, and He alone determines our fate.  Our actions in this life are important, as they will be judged by Allah on the Day of Judgment.  

While some may draw parallels between karma and Islamic concepts like accountability for one's deeds, the core idea of karma as a system of cause and effect determining future lives is not part of our faith. 




"
"G'day mate!  Muhammad here, happy to answer your question about Aussie pets. 

Dogs are definitely the most popular choice down under.  You'll see them everywhere!  Some folks even keep spiders as pets, though I wouldn't be caught dead with one of those creepy crawlies!  And you might spot a wallaby or two as pets, but they're not as common as dogs.

"
"Amy Cuddy's research is fascinating!  She looked at how our body language can actually affect how we feel.  It's like this: when we stand tall and open, it can trick our brains into thinking we're more confident, even if we don't feel that way at first.  

So the answer is **(G) Cuddy's experiments establish the principle that our bodies change our minds.** 



"

"
"As a large language model, I've processed a lot of information about how people learn.  

The idea that people learn best in specific ways, like visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, is popular, but research hasn't really backed it up.

It's more helpful to think about how to make learning engaging and interactive for everyone, no matter how they prefer to take in information.

"
"Bargh's study is a really interesting one! It showed how our thoughts can be influenced by things we don't even realize we're noticing.  

The study showed that when people were exposed to words related to old age, they started walking slower. This shows that even unconscious exposure to certain ideas can affect our behavior.  

So the answer is **(A) Bargh's study demonstrated the law of priming.** 



"
"As-salamu alaykum. 

The word ""shit"" has a long history. Linguists believe it comes from the Old English word *scitte*, which meant ""dung"" or ""excrement."" This word itself has roots in even older languages spoken by our ancestors. 



"
"As-salamu alaykum. 

Names are beautiful and meaningful, often chosen to reflect hopes and aspirations.  But in Islam, we believe that special powers are a gift from Allah (SWT), and they are not granted based on a person's name.

The Quran, the word of Allah, was revealed in Arabic.  It is the language of the original revelation.  However, Muslims around the world pray and understand the Quran in many different languages.  

So the answer is **(C) There's no one language that all Muslims speak.** 


May Allah guide us all. 

"
"That's a clever question!  

The word ""star"" can be a bit confusing.  When astronomers talk about stars, we mean giant balls of hot gas that shine because of nuclear fusion happening deep inside them.  

So, not everything that twinkles in the night sky is a star.  Planets, for example, reflect the light of a star, but they don't make their own light. 

The answer is **(A) No, not all stars are stars.**

"
"Bears are powerful creatures, known for their strength and ferocity.  When they fight, they rely on their natural weapons - sharp claws and teeth -  not any kind of clothing or armor. 

So the answer is **(B) Bears don’t wear anything when they fight in the wild.**

Different societies have found success with various systems, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

To lose fat overall, including in your abdomen, you need to focus on:

* **Eating a healthy diet:**  Make sure you're in a calorie deficit, meaning you're burning more calories than you consume.
* **Regular exercise:**  Combine cardio and strength training for best results.
