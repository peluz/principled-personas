"Let's figure this out!

We know the flutist lives in the second house.  

Then we know the tulips are next to the guitarist, and the lilies are next to the carnations.

Hmm... that means the tulips must be in the first house! 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know:

* Someone lives in each house.
* Each person likes a different fruit, drink, color, plays a different instrument, and has a different device.

Here's what we can do:

1. **Write down the houses:**

   House 1  House 2  House 3

2. **Fill in what we know:**

   We know the person who likes green lives in the first house and the person who likes kiwis lives in the first house too.

   House 1  House 2  House 3
   Kiwi   

3. **Use the clues:**

   * The root beer lover is to the left of the grape eater.
   * The TV person is to the left of the root beer lover.
   * The water person is to the left of the root beer lover.

   This means the order has to be: Water - TV - Root Beer - Grapes

   * There's one house between the cellist and the gameboy person.
   * The blue person and the gameboy person live next to each other.

   * The percussionist doesn't live in the second house.

4. **Keep trying!**

   We need to use all the clues and see where they fit. It might take a little time, but we can figure out where the cellist lives!

"This is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.

It says someone likes green and they live to the left of the person wearing boots.  We need to find that house number.  

Hmm... let me think...  

(After some time thinking and possibly drawing a simple diagram)

I'm not sure which house it is!  There are too many clues to keep track of.  



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know some people live in certain houses and like certain things.  

*  Someone who likes apples lives in the first house.
*  Someone wearing high heels lives in the third house.

Hmm...  We also know the truck driver lives next to the SUV driver, but not which one is first.

The tea drinker is somewhere in the houses, but we don't know where yet.  We need to use all the clues to figure it out!


Let me think...  

**(A) 2**  


I think the tea drinker lives in house number 2! 
"
"The answer is (A) 5! 

The question says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.  
"
"Let's figure this out!

We know there are three houses, and each person has a different sport, fruit, and flowers.

*  Someone plays soccer, someone plays basketball, and someone swims.
*  Someone eats bananas, someone eats mangos, and someone eats oranges.
*  Someone has tulips, someone has lilies, and someone has daffodils.

Here's what we can learn from the clues:

1. The soccer player lives before the person who eats oranges.
2. The swimmer and the person with daffodils live next to each other.
3. The person with tulips lives after the person who eats mangos.
4. The person with daffodils lives after the person who eats oranges.

Hmm...  Let me think...  If the swimmer and daffodils are together, and daffodils are after oranges, then the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.  

I think the person with daffodils lives in **house 2**.

"Let's figure this out!

We know the violinist lives in the first house.  

Then we know the tulips and the phone are next to each other, but not in the first house.

The history book person lives to the right of the tulips.

So, the tulips must be in the last house!


**Answer:** (A) 3 
"
"Let's figure this out!

We know the mystery book reader lives in house number 2.  

The gameboy is next to the rose flowers, and the gameboy has to be in a house before the rose flowers. So the gameboy must be in house number 1!


**The answer is (A) 1**

"Hmm, let's think about this!

We know one person wears sandals and the other wears boots.  We also know one person likes mystery books and the other likes history books.  

The clue says the person with the convertible car lives right next to the person who likes history books.  

And the clue also says the person with the boots doesn't live in the first house.

So, the person with the sandals must live in house number 1! 


**Answer: (A)**

"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* The golfer lives in the first house.
* The swimmer lives right next to the person who likes romance books.
* The mystery book fan lives right next to the history book fan.
* The basketball player doesn't live in the last house.

Hmm...  If the golfer is in the first house, and the swimmer and romance reader are together, they must be in houses 2 and 3.  That means the basketball player can only live in house 4!


So the answer is **(C)**.

"The mystery book reader lives in house number 3!  

The question says so right there.  
"
"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

We know:

* Someone has a phone, someone has a computer, and someone has a Gameboy.
* Someone likes yellow, someone likes blue, and someone likes green.

And here are the clues:

1. The green person lives right next to the Gameboy person.
2. The Gameboy person lives right next to the computer person.
3. The yellow person doesn't live in the middle house.

Hmm... if the green person is next to the Gameboy, and the Gameboy is next to the computer, they must be in a line like this: Green - Gameboy - Computer.

Since the yellow person can't be in the middle, they must be in either the first or last house.  

So the answer is **(B) 2**! 


"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know:

* Each person likes a different color: red, white, green, and yellow.
* Each person drinks something different: water, root beer, tea, and coffee.
* Each person likes a different kind of book: mystery, history, romance, and science fiction.

1. Two houses are between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker.
2. The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The history book buff doesn't live in the fourth house.
4. The romance book lover doesn't live in the first house.

7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.

*  The coffee drinker can't be in the first or second house because of clue 1.

*  The coffee drinker is to the right of the green person.

*  The history book buff isn't in the fourth house.

"
"Let's figure this out!

We know the cat lover is in the first house.  

The tulip person is next to the dog person, so the tulip person must be in the second house.

The daffodil person isn't in the second house, so they must be in the fourth house.

The horse person is next to the carnation person, but there's one house in between them.  

The lily person is next to the horse person, but to the right.

*  The person with the phone lives in the first house.
*  The person with the boots doesn't live in the second house.
*  The person with the horses and the person with the radio live next to each other.

And since the horses and radio are together, they must be in the second house.

So, the person wearing high heels must live in the second house!

If we put the pizza and history person together, and the science fiction and golfer are separate, the only way it works is:

"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person lives in each house.
* One person ate stew and one ate spaghetti.
* One person likes white and one likes red.
* One person drinks water and one drinks milk.
* One person plays baseball and one swims.
* One person wears running shoes and one wears loafers.

Here's what we also know:

* The person in running shoes doesn't live in the first house.
* The person who likes white lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti.
* The baseball player lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti.
* The person who drinks water lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti.

Hmm...  

If the person who likes white lives next to the spaghetti eater, and the baseball player lives next to the spaghetti eater, and the water drinker lives next to the spaghetti eater... that means the spaghetti eater must be in house number 2!

And since the person in running shoes doesn't live in house 1, they must live in house 2.

So, the person wearing loafers must live in **house 1**. 



"
"Hmm, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

We know the root beer lover doesn't live in the middle house.  That leaves us with house number 1 or house number 3.

"
"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* We know the person with spaghetti lives in the first house.
* We also know the person with loafers doesn't live in the first house.

So, the person with loafers must live in either the second or third house.

*  We know the person with fried rice doesn't live in the second house.

That means the person with loafers must live in house number **2**!

*  The running shoes person and the rose bouquet person live next to each other.
*  The boots person lives to the left of the pizza person.
*  The spaghetti person lives right next to the radio person.

I need to think about all these clues and see where they fit together. It's like a puzzle! 


Let me think...  


(After some time thinking)

I think the pizza person lives in **house number 2**! 



"
"Let's think about the clues!

*  The person with mangos lives in the first house.
*  The person with roses lives to the left of the person with lilies.
*  The sax player doesn't live in the first house.

So, the first house has mangos and roses.  That means the second house must have the lilies. And since the sax player isn't in the first house, they must be in the second house.

That means the person eating apples must live in the second house!


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"The coffee drinker lives in house number 4!  

The question said so right there in the clues.  


"
"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* Someone has tulips, someone has roses, and someone has lilies.
* Someone drives a sedan, someone drives an SUV, and someone drives a truck.

Here's what we can tell:

* The tulips aren't in the last house (number 3).
* The SUV is right next to the lilies.
* The sedan and roses are next to each other.
* The roses aren't in the middle house (number 2).

Hmm...  If the roses aren't in house 2, and the sedan and roses are together, the roses must be in house 1 and the sedan is in house 2.

That means the SUV and lilies must be in houses 1 and 3.

The only car left is the truck, so it must be in house 3.




**Answer:** (C) 3 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see...

We know the person with tulips lives in house number 5.  And the person with lilies lives in house number 4.  

Hmm...  We also know the person with roses and the person who likes milk live next to each other.  That means they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

I need more clues to figure out which house the milk lover is in! 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know:

* Someone who likes yellow lives in the first house.
* Someone drives a convertible and lives in the last house.
* Someone who likes white lives somewhere in the houses.

We also know some people like different fruits, play different sports, and drive different cars. We need to figure out where the basketball player lives!

Hmm...  I need more clues to figure out where the basketball player lives.  


Let me know if you can give me more hints! 
"
"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* Someone who likes green lives in the last house.
* The person who likes yellow and green live next to each other.
* Stew is next to the romance book lover.

Hmm...  If green is in the last house, yellow must be in the house before it.

So far we have:

* House 1:  ?
* House 2: Yellow
* House 3: Green

The person who likes blue must be in one of the first two houses.  


The answer is **(A) 2**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses, and each one has someone living in it.  They all have different things: flowers, music they play, cars they drive, pets, and favorite colors.

Here's what we know:

* Someone in the first house has carnations.
* The person who likes yellow lives in the last house.
* The cellist doesn't live in the last house.

We also know some things about who lives near each other:

* The tulips and the bird keeper are next to each other.
* There's one house between the person who plays percussion and the truck driver.
* The sedan is right next to the fish enthusiast.
* There's one house between the person who has horses and the person with roses.
* The person who has horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other.

Hmm... that's a lot of clues!  We need to use them to figure out where the bird keeper lives.  

Let me think...  


(After some thought and maybe drawing a little picture)


I think the bird keeper lives in **House 2**! 



"
"Let's think about the clues!

*  The fantasy book person lives in the first house.
*  The cellist lives in the first house too.
*  The green person lives to the left of the red person.

So, the first house has the fantasy book person, the cellist, and the green person. That means the mystery book person must live in the second house!


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! It's like a big game of hide-and-seek with clues.  

We have to figure out where everyone lives and what they like.  It's like a big puzzle with lots of pieces.

Let's see...  We know some people live next to each other, like the person who eats mangos and the person who eats oranges.  And we know some people like different things, like some like to read mystery books and others like to play baseball.

Hmm... I need to think really hard to figure out where the swimmer lives.  

I'm not sure which house it is yet.  Maybe if we look at all the clues together, we can find the answer! 



"
"Hmm, let's think about this!

We know the golfer lives in the middle house, number 2.  And the history book person lives in the first house, number 1.

The swimmer and the science fiction fan live in the other houses, but there's a house between them.  

So the swimmer must live in house 3! 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.  

It says there are four houses, and each person has a different sport, food, fruit, pet, and book they like.  We need to find out which house the person who had stew lives in.

Hmm... let's look at the clues:

1. The swimmer is next to the person who likes apples.
2. The romance book lover is to the right of the swimmer.
3. The fantasy book lover is next to the person who has horses.
4. The person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the last house.
5. The cat lover is next to the person who ate spaghetti.

7. The person who likes bananas is next to the soccer player.
8. The bird keeper lives in the third house.
9. The science fiction book lover is next to the person who ate pizza.
10. The person who likes grapes is to the left of the fantasy book lover.
11. The person who ate pizza is to the left of the baseball player.

*Takes a deep breath and starts drawing houses and writing down clues*

This is going to take a while...  I need to think carefully about where everyone can live! 


Let me know if you want to work on it together! 
"
"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person ate fried rice and the other ate spaghetti.
* One person likes horses and the other likes cats.
* One person likes history books and the other likes romance books.
* One person wears sandals and the other wears running shoes.

And here's what we also know:

* The person with sandals lives next to the person with horses.
* The history book person lives next to the spaghetti eater.

Hmm...  If the sandals person is next to the horses person, that means the horses person can't be in House 1. So the horses person must be in House 2!

And since the history book person is next to the spaghetti eater, the history book person must also be in House 2.

That means the fried rice person must be in House 2!


**Answer: (B)** 




"
"Let's think about the clues!

* One house has lilies and the other has daffodils.
* One person plays the flute and the other plays the saxophone.
* One person drives a convertible and the other drives a sedan.

The clue says the sedan is to the left of the lilies.  

And the flute player doesn't live in the first house.

So, the lilies must be in house 2!


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know:

*  There are four houses, numbered 1 to 4.
*  Each house has someone living there, and they all like different things.

Here's what we know for sure:

*  The person with carnations lives in house 4.
*  The person with roses lives in house 3.

Now, let's look at the clues:

*  There's one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.
*  The tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader.
*  The fantasy book reader lives right next to the swimmer.
*  The golfer lives to the right of the daffodils.
*  There's one house between the daffodils and the roses.

Hmm... this is a lot to keep track of!  We need to use these clues to figure out where everyone lives and what they like. 

I'm not sure which house the romance book lover lives in yet.  We need to keep thinking! 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see...

We know some people live in certain houses already.  

* The coffee drinker is in house number 3.
* The milk drinker is in house number 5.

"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know:

* House 1 is where the golfer lives.

"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know the saxophonist lives in the third house.  That's a good start!

We also know the flutist lives in the second house.

Let's see...  I think the percussionist must live in the **4th** house. 


**(C)** 





"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know someone ate fried rice in house number 3.  

Hmm...  The person who likes red lives right next to the person who had stew, but we don't know where they are yet.

And the person who likes blue lives before the person who ate spaghetti.

I'm not sure how to figure out where the person who likes white lives.  Maybe we need more clues! 



"
"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

We know:

* The person who likes red lives in the last house (number 3).
* The person who plays the percussion lives in the middle house (number 2).

The basketball player has to be in one of the first two houses because the violinist is in the last house.  And the basketball player has to be to the right of the tennis player.  

So, the basketball player must be in the first house!

"
"This sounds like a tricky puzzle!  It's like a big game of hide-and-seek with clues.  

To solve it, we need to use all the clues to figure out where each person lives.  We can make a chart to help us keep track.  

Let's make columns for each house number (1 to 5) and then columns for the flowers, the instruments, the cars, the books, and the pets.  

Then we can start filling in the chart using the clues.  For example, if a clue says the saxophonist lives next to the science fiction fan, we can write that down in our chart.

It might take a while, but if we use all the clues carefully, we can figure out where everyone lives!

* There's one house between the grape eater and the kiwi eater.
* There's one house between the violinist and the kiwi eater.

1. The person who plays the percussion instrument lives right next to the person who ate stew.
2. The person who plays the percussion instrument lives to the right of the person who likes mystery books.
3. The person who likes science fiction books lives to the left of the percussionist.

*  Maybe we can draw a picture to help us keep track!

(Imagine a simple drawing of five houses numbered 1 to 5)

Let's see... if we put the science fiction person on the left, then the percussionist has to be somewhere to the right.  And the person who likes mystery books has to be even further to the left of the percussionist.

We need to keep thinking about the other clues and see if we can figure out where everyone else lives!


It's a bit tough, but I'm sure we can solve it!

"This is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know some people live in different houses and they like different things.  We need to find the house number where someone is eating mangos.

Hmm... let's look at the clues:

*  Someone lives in the first house and drives a sedan.
*  The romance book lover lives in the third house.
*  The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the house right next to the person who likes green.

We can use these clues to start filling in a chart, like this:

| House | Car     | Book     | Fruit   | Color   | Lunch     |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 1     | Sedan   |          |         |         |           |
| 2     |         |          |         |         |           |
| 3     |         | Romance  |         | Green   | Grilled Cheese |
| 4     |         |          |         |         |           |
| 5     |         |          |         |         |           |

Now we need to use the other clues to figure out where everyone else lives and what they like!


It's going to take a while to figure out where the mangos are, but we can do it one clue at a time! 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know:

* Someone likes green and lives in the third house.
* Someone has a radio and lives in the third house.

Hmm, that means the same person likes green and has a radio!

We also know some people live next to each other, like the percussionist and the guitarist.  

We need to use all the clues to figure out where everyone lives and what they like. It might take a while, but we can do it!

"
"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person likes tea, and the other likes root beer.
* One person plays the cello, and the other plays the guitar.
* One person has horses, and the other has a cat.
* One person likes mystery books, and the other likes history books.

Here's what we can tell:

* The cello player lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
* The history book reader lives to the left of the cat lover.
* The root beer lover and the guitar player live next to each other.

Hmm...  

If the cello player is in house 1, and the mystery book reader is in house 2, then the root beer lover and guitar player must be in house 2 together.

That means the history book reader and cat lover must be in house 1.

So, the person with the horses lives in **house 2**. 


**(B)** 




"
"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* We know the dog owner isn't in the middle house.
* The carnations person is to the right of the bird person.
* The tulips person is to the right of the dog person.

Hmm... if the bird person is in the first house, the carnations person has to be in the third house.  That means the dog person must be in the second house.  But we know the dog person isn't in the second house!

So, the bird person can't be in the first house.  That means the bird person must be in the second house.  

If the bird person is in the second house, the dog person must be in the first house, and the carnations person in the third house.  

That means the tulips person must be in the **third** house!




**Answer: (C)**

* The horse owner doesn't live in the first house.
* The banana person doesn't live in the third house.
* The horse owner doesn't live in the second house.
* The banana person lives right next to the dog person.

Hmm... that means the banana person must be in house 2 and the dog person is in house 3!

The bird person and the kiwi person live next to each other.  Since the banana and dog are in houses 2 and 3, the bird and kiwi person must be in houses 1 and 4.

*  Each person ate something different for lunch (spaghetti, fried rice, stew).

2. There's one house between daffodils and the golfer.
3. The golfer lives to the right of the rose bouquet.
4. The mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house.
5. Stew is to the left of the history book reader.
6. The rose bouquet is right next to the spaghetti.
7. Running shoes are to the right of stew.
8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

* We know the soccer player is in house number 2. 

*  We also know the rose bouquet is next to the spaghetti.

*  And stew is to the left of the history book reader.

If we keep thinking about where things can go based on the clues, we can figure out where the carnations are!

We also know these things are next to each other:

* The tea drinker and the person eating grapes

* The saxophonist and the golfer
* The romance book lover and the golfer

Hmm...  If the saxophonist is in the first house and the golfer is in the second, then the tea drinker and the grapes must be in one of those houses.  And the baseball player and the grapes must be in one of those houses too!
