"Let's see...  

The flutist is in the second house, that's for sure.  And the tulips are right next to the guitar player.  Hmm...  

I think the tulips are in the first house.  

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

Okay, so we got three houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it, eatin' different fruits, drinkin' different things, and playin' different music.  

Hmm...  The first house is green, and someone's eatin' kiwis there.  That's a start!

*  The root beer guy lives before the grape guy.
*  The TV guy lives before the root beer guy.
*  The water guy lives before the root beer guy.

So, it looks like the order is water, TV, root beer, grapes.

*  The cellist and the gameboy guy are one house apart.
*  The blue guy and the gameboy guy live next to each other.

And the percussionist ain't in the middle house.

*  

Let me think...  

(After some more pondering and scribbling)

I think the cellist lives in **house number 2**.

"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the person wearin' boots lives to the right of the one who likes green.  And the person who likes red lives in the second house.  Hmm...  

I ain't real good with all these clues, but I'll try my best.  

(A) 4 


Let me know if you got any more of these puzzles! 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  We know someone lives in each house, and they all like different drinks, fruits, foods, shoes, and cars. 
*  There are some clues that tell us who lives near who.

Hmm...  Let me see if I can figure out where the tea drinker lives.  

*  The clues say the truck driver is next to the SUV, and the person in high heels lives in the third house.

That doesn't tell us about tea, though.  

*  Oh!  One clue says the truck driver is to the right of the tea drinker.  

That means the tea drinker can't be in the first house.

*  Another clue says the truck driver is to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

So, the tea drinker has to be in house **2**. 



**Answer: (A)** 
"
"That there fella who ate grilled cheese, he lives in house number 5.  

(A) 5 
"
"Hmm, let me see...  This is kinda tricky.  

So we got three houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it, and they each like different stuff.  

* One likes soccer, one likes basketball, and one likes swimmin'.
* One eats bananas, one eats mangos, and one eats oranges.
* One has tulips, one has lilies, and one has daffodils.

Okay, so the soccer guy lives before the orange eater.  And the swimmer and the daffodils are right next to each other.  And the tulips are after the mangos.  And the daffodils are after the oranges.

Let me think...  

I reckon the daffodils are in house number **2**. 



"
"Let's see...  

That there's a lot of clues!  But I think I got it.  

The tulips are in house number **3**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right?  And each house has a different person livin' in it.  

They each got somethin' different too: a gameboy, a phone, and a computer.  And they got different flowers, like carnations, lilies, and roses.  Plus, they play different music stuff - flute, drums, and cello.  And they got different pets: horses, birds, and fish.  

And they like different books too: history, romance, and mystery.

Now, here's what we know:

* The bird guy don't live in the first house.
* The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
* The bird guy don't live in the third house.
* The history book guy lives right next to the lilies.
* The drummer lives right next to the computer guy.
* The fish guy don't live in the first house.
* The gameboy guy lives right next to the rose guy.
* The cello guy don't live in the third house.

Hmm...  Let me think...

The gameboy guy must live in **(A) 1**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  It's all about figuring out where everyone lives and what they got.  

Hmm...  I'm not real good with all these clues, but I'll try my best.  

(After some thought and scribbling)

I think the person with the phone lives in house number **(E) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

So, one fella's got sandals, the other's got boots. One likes mysteries, the other likes history books. And one drives a fancy car that goes down, the other drives a big truck.

The guy with the fancy car lives right next to the history book guy. And the boots ain't in the first house.

That means the sandals guy must be in the first house!

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Let's see...  Golfer's in the first house, that's for sure.  Then the swimmer's right next to the romance book lover, but the swimmer ain't in the third house.  So they gotta be in the second or first house.  And the mystery book guy's right next to the history book guy.  Basketball player can't be in the last house.  Hmm... that means the basketball player must be in the last house!


(C) 





"
"That there fella readin' mysteries lives in house number 3.  It says so right there!  

**(B)** 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

So we got three houses, right?  One fella in each.  One's got a phone, one's got a computer, and one's got a gameboy.  And they each like a different color: yellow, blue, and green.

Okay, so someone who likes green lives right next to the gameboy guy. And the gameboy guy lives right next to the computer guy.  That means they gotta be in order like this: Green - Gameboy - Computer.

And the yellow guy, he ain't in the middle house.

So, the computer guy must be in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  We know someone likes red and lives in the third house.
*  Someone else likes root beer and lives in the third house too.  That means the same person likes both red and root beer!

*  The coffee drinker can't live in the first or second house 'cause there's gotta be two houses between the white-lover and the coffee drinker.

Hmm... I'm not sure how to figure out the rest.  Maybe the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house?


**(B) 4** 
"
"Let's see...  

House 1 is where the fantasy book person lives, right?  And the pizza person ain't in the first house.  

So, the pizza person must be in house 2.  

The green person is next to the radio person, so the green person must be in house 2 too.

That means the cat person is in house 2. 


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"This puzzle sounds real tricky!  I ain't no brainiac, but I can try to help.  

It's like a big ol' puzzle with lots of pieces.  You gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.  

I'm not sure how to find the house number for the water drinker without lookin' at all the clues.  Maybe if you tell me some more about what each person likes, I can help ya figure it out. 



"
"That there fella eatin' kiwis lives in the first house.  

(A) 1 
"
"This here's a tough one!  Let's see...  

It says folks are eatin' different fruits and stuff, and they got different flowers too.  

Hmm...  The clue about the roses and grilled cheese bein' next to each other is a good start.  

*scratches head*

I dunno, this is makin' my head spin.  Too many clues!  I'm gonna need a nap.  Maybe I'll figure it out later. 


"
"Let's see...  

The cat fella lives in the first house, that's for sure.  Then the tulips are right next to the dog guy.  So the dog guy must be in the third house.  

The daffodils ain't in the second house, so they gotta be in the last one.  

That leaves the horses and the flowers for the other spots.  

The fish guy has to be in the first house, right?  


**Answer:** (C) 1 
"
"Let's see...

House 1 has the phone, and the boots ain't in House 2.  

The horse and radio guy's gotta be next to each other, so they're in House 2.

"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

I think the green lover lives in **(A) 2**.  



"
"Let's see...  

* Baseball player is in house number 2.
* Tennis player is right next to the cat lover.

Hmm... that means the bird keeper can't be in the first house or the third house.  

The only place left for the bird keeper is house number 4. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"This puzzle is kinda tricky, but I'll give it a shot.  

Let's see...  We got three houses, and each one has a person in it.  They each like a different color, drive a different kind of car, play a different instrument, got a different gadget, and play a different sport.  

Hmm...  The clues are sayin' some stuff about where they live and what they like.  I'll try to keep track of it all.

*  The white-lover is to the right of the computer guy.
*  There's one house between the baseball player and the blue-lover.
*  The sedan and SUV are next to each other.
*  The swimmer lives to the right of the SUV.
*  The sedan and gameboy guy live next to each other.
*  The guitarist lives to the right of the white-lover.

*Whew*  That's a lot of info!  I'm gonna need to think about this for a bit.  

Let me see...  I'm not sure which house the soccer player lives in yet.  I need to figure out where everyone else is first. 




"
"That there fella who ate grilled cheese, he lives in the first house.  

(E) 1 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  So we got three houses, right?  One piano player, one violin player, and one who bangs on things.
*  And they each got different shoes on - runners, high heels, and boots.
*  Plus, they're munchin' on oranges, bananas, and kiwis.
*  And each fella's got a different gizmo - a TV, a phone, and a radio.

Hmm...  Let me see if I can make sense of these clues...

*  The piano player ain't in the first house.
*  The orange eater is to the right of the kiwi eater.
*  The high heels and the piano player are right next to each other.
*  The runner and the drummer are right next to each other too.

(After some time of thinking)

Okay, I think I got it!  The TV guy lives in **house 3**. 




"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each person has a different car, drink, fruit, and color they like.  

Hmm...  The only thing I know for sure is that the person with the apples lives in the third house.  

I'm not real good with all these clues, but I'll try my best.

I think the person with the sedan lives in house **4**. 



"
"Let's see...  

*  The kiwi guy lives in the first house.
*  The truck guy ain't in the first house.
*  Neither the truck guy nor the SUV guy lives in the last house.

So, the SUV guy must be in the second house. 

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

The fried rice guy is in the last house, right?  And the spaghetti guy is right next to him.  So the spaghetti guy must be in the house right before the last one. 

That means the spaghetti guy is in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each person has a different car, color, and shoes.  That's a lot to keep track of!

*  We know the blue person lives in the last house.
*  And the white person lives in the fourth house.

Hmm...  Let's see if we can figure out where the boots go.  It says the truck is not in the fourth house, and the truck is next to the sandals.  That means the truck and sandals can't be in the fourth house either.

*  The person with the boots lives before the truck, and the truck is before the sandals.

So, the boots gotta be in one of the first three houses.  

I'm gonna need more clues to figure out for sure where the boots are! 



"
"The history book guy lives in the first house.  That's what it says right there!  

So the answer is (B). 



"
"This puzzle sounds real tricky!  I ain't no brainiac, but I can try to help.  

Let's see...  It says there are five houses, and each person has a different job, eats a different fruit, and likes a different book.  That's a lot of stuff to keep track of!

Hmm...  The only thing I can really say for sure is that the soccer player lives in the first house.  

The rest of it is just too much for my head.  Maybe someone smarter can figure it out! 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Flowers, colors they like, shoes they wear, and books they read.  

Let's see...

*  Someone's got lilies, someone's got carnations, and someone's got daffodils.
*  One likes green, one likes blue, and one likes yellow.
*  One's wearin' boots, one's wearin' loafers, and one's wearin' high heels.
*  One likes romance books, one likes history books, and one likes science fiction.

And here are some clues to help us figure it out:

1. The blue-liker lives to the right of the high heels.
2. The yellow-liker doesn't live in the first house.
3. The history book person lives in the second house.
4. The yellow-liker doesn't live in the third house.

6. The loafer-wearer lives in the third house.
7. The daffodil-lover lives in the second house.
8. The boot-wearer and the yellow-liker live right next to each other.

*  We know the history book person is in the second house, and they got daffodils.
*  The loafer-wearer is in the third house.
*  The yellow-liker can't be in the first or third house.

  ...

"
"That there fella wearin' the runnin' shoes lives in the first house.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So we got three houses, right?  One guy's got a truck, one's got a car, and one's got a fancy SUV.  

The cricket guy lives in the first house, that's for sure.  And the horse guy lives next to the car guy.  

Hmm... the truck guy's gotta be somewhere past the basketball guy.  

That means the basketball guy can't be in the last house.  

So the basketball guy must be in house 2!


**Answer: (B)** 





"
"This puzzle sounds tricky!  I ain't no brain surgeon, but I'm good at followin' directions.  

Let's see...  It's all about matchin' up these folks with their stuff.  I'd start by makin' a list, maybe like this:

* House 1:  
* House 2:  
* House 3:  
* House 4:  
* House 5:  

Then I'd go through each clue and see if it tells me somethin' specific about a house number.  Like, if it says the TV is two houses away from the sedan, I'd write that down next to those two things on my list.

It's gonna take a while, but I'm patient.  I'll keep at it till I figure out where that tulip vase goes!



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  We got four houses, each with a different kinda shoe, car, food, and drink. 
*  Some folks live right next to each other eatin' the same kinda stuff or drivin' the same kinda car.

Hmm...  I'm not real good with all these clues, but I'll try my best.  

Let me see...  (pauses, scratches head)

I dunno, this is too hard for me.  I'm better at fixin' cars than puzzles! 


"
"Well, lemme see...  This puzzle's got me thinkin'.  

So, there's four houses, right? And each one's got someone livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like drinks and food and wearin' different shoes.  

The clue says the cellist lives right next to the tea drinker. And the tea drinker lives in the last house. So, the cellist must be in the house before that one.

That means the cellist lives in **House 3**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see if I can figure this out.  It's like a puzzle, right?

So we got these houses, and each person's got a different thing they like.  

* One likes to swim, one plays soccer, one plays tennis, and one plays basketball.
* They each got different cars too: a sedan, an SUV, a truck, and a minivan.
* And they each like different drinks: water, tea, root beer, and coffee.
* Oh, and they got different flowers in their houses too: carnations, lilies, daffodils, and roses.

The clues are kinda tricky, but let's see...

*  One house between the coffee drinker and the tennis player.
*  The daffodils and lilies are next to each other.
*  The swimmer is right next to the sedan.
*  The truck is right next to the carnations.
*  The lilies are to the right of the basketball player.
*  The tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker.
*  The swimmer doesn't live in the first house.
*  The basketball player is right next to the truck.
*  The minivan is in the last house.
*  The root beer lover lives in the third house.

I think the truck is in **house number 2**.

"Let's see...  

*  The tea guy lives in the first house, that's for sure.
*  The apple guy is to the left of the minivan guy.
*  The fancy car guy is to the right of the sci-fi book guy.
*  There's one house between the fantasy book guy and the coffee guy.

Hmm...  That means the coffee guy can't be in the first or third house.  So he must be in the **second** house. 

**(B)** 



"
"Let's see...

The red person is in the middle house, right?  And the mystery person is next to 'em.  So the mystery person must be in the last house.  

That means the fantasy person can only be in the first house. 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"That there, the third house is where the SUV livin'.  

(A) 3 
"
"This puzzle is kinda tricky, but I'll give it a shot!  Let's see...

So we got three houses, right?  And each house has a different fruit, flower, music thing, drink, and gadget.  

*  The TV guy lives right next to the tea drinker.
*  The kiwi guy lives past the coffee guy.
*  The tea drinker ain't in the middle house.
*  The TV guy lives right next to the guitar guy.
*  There's one house between the flute guy and the banana guy.
*  The tulips are past the radio.
*  The rose guy lives in the middle house.

I think the root beer guy lives in **(A) 3**.

"Let's see...  This is kinda like a puzzle I do with my grandkids sometimes.  

Okay, so we got four houses, right?  And each house has someone in it, and they all like different books and eat different fruits and wear different shoes.

Let me see...  

(After some thought and scribbling)

I think the science fiction guy lives in house number **4**. 



"
"Okay, so we got two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  Two folks livin' in 'em.

One eats spaghetti, one eats fried rice. One plays the flute, one plays the cello. One wears loafers, one wears sandals. One likes white, one likes green. And one drives a sedan, one drives an SUV.

Now, here's what we know:

* The fried rice ain't in the first house.
* The SUV ain't in the second house.
* The flute player lives right next to the white-lover.
* The loafer-wearer lives right next to the white-lover.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

If the flute player is next to the white-lover, and the loafer-wearer is next to the white-lover too... that means they gotta be together!  

So, the flute player, the loafers, and the white-lover are all in the first house.

That means the sandals gotta be in the second house!

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  We got three houses, right?  One, two, and three.
*  Each house has a different kinda flower, fruit, car, music thing, and drink.

*  Someone drinks water and lives next to the minivan person.

House 1 has the TV, and the lilies ain't in the first house.  So the computer must be in the second house, right?

So we got two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  Two folks livin' in 'em. One ate pizza, one ate spaghetti.  One likes tulips, one likes daffodils.  One reads history books, one reads sci-fi.  One plays baseball, one plays golf.  And one plays guitar, one plays drums, I guess.

Okay, so the sci-fi guy lives to the left of the golfer.  And the pizza guy and the history guy live right next to each other.  And the guitar player lives to the right of the daffodils.

Let me think...  

Hmm...  I reckon the drummer lives in **(B) 2**.

"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

Okay, so we got five houses, and each one has a different person livin' in it.  They got different pets, play different music, and use different gadgets.

*  The violinist lives in the fourth house. That's a good start!
*  The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

*  The gameboy guy lives to the right of the guitarist.
*  The guitarist lives to the right of the percussionist.

That means the percussionist has to be in one of the first few houses.

*  The TV guy lives to the left of the radio guy.

*  The flutist lives right next to the TV guy.

*  The dog guy doesn't live in the second house.

*  The fish guy and the horse guy live right next to each other.

*  There are two houses between the phone guy and the horse guy.

Dang, this is tough!  I'm gonna need a minute to think about all these clues... 


Let me know if you want me to keep tryin'! 




"
"Hmm, let me see...

So, one house has lilies, and the other has roses.  The person with the radio lives to the right of the apple eater and the guy who plays the violin.  And the basketball player ain't in the first house.

That means the violinist and the apple eater gotta be in the first house, 'cause the radio guy is in the other one. 

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...  

So we got five houses, right?  And each one has a different sport player and a different food.

* Tennis guy's in the third house.
* Grilled cheese guy's in the last house.

*  Fried rice and spaghetti are next to each other, but not together.
* Stew's right next to spaghetti.

* Pizza guy's gotta be before the cricket guy.
* Tennis guy's before the soccer guy.

Putting it all together...

The cricket guy must be in the **(C) 1**st house.

* One fella eats stew, the other eats spaghetti.
* One likes white, the other likes red.
* One drinks water, the other drinks milk.
* One plays baseball, the other swims.
* One wears runnin' shoes, the other wears loafers.

* The guy with the runnin' shoes ain't in the first house.

* The white-liker lives right next to the spaghetti eater.

* The baseball player and the spaghetti eater are right next to each other.

* The water-drinker and the spaghetti eater are right next to each other.

Let me think...  

Hmm...  I think the loafers are in **house 1**. 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one.  Let's see...

*  The coffee guy lives before the mango guy, that much I get.
*  The water guy lives after the root beer guy.
*  The root beer guy ain't in the middle house.
*  The orange guy ain't in the middle house neither.

That means the root beer guy could be in the first or last house.  I can't tell for sure which one. 



"
"Let's see...  

* Spaghetti is in the first house.
* Loafers ain't in the first house.
* Fried rice ain't in the second house.
* Boots gotta be next to fried rice.

(A) 2

I think the person with the lilies lives in house number **4**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

The mystery book person is in the first house, right?  So the other person, the one who likes fantasy books, must be in the second house. 

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the person who likes white lives to the right of the person wearin' runnin' shoes.  And we know the loafers are in the last house.  That means the white person can't be in the first or second house.  

So it's gotta be either the third or fourth house.

It says the cellist lives in the first house.  That's a good start.  

Hmm,  lots of clues about colors, drinks, and stuff.  I ain't real good with all that fancy stuff.  

But, it says the water drinker is to the left of the coffee drinker.  Maybe that'll help us figure out where the water drinker lives.  

*scratches head*

I dunno, this is tough!  I'm gonna need more clues! 



"
"The fella who likes red lives in the first house.  So the answer is (C). 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each one has a different person livin' in it.  They all got different stuff too - pets, gadgets, shoes, sports, and flowers.  

Hmm...  I can't figure out which house has the lilies.  Too many clues to keep track of!  Maybe if I had a picture or somethin'...



"
"Let's see...  

Kiwi guy is in the first house, that's for sure.  And the sci-fi fan is in the second house.  

The bird guy and the high heels are right next to each other, so they gotta be in the second house too.

The tennis player and the apple guy are buddies, so they're together.  

That means the cricketer has to be in the first house.


So the answer is **(A)**. 





"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each person has a different pet, ate something different, plays a different sport, and eats a different fruit.  That's a lot to keep track of!

Hmm...  It says the person who ate pizza lives in the last house. And the person who ate grilled cheese lives right next to them. So, they must be in the fourth and fifth houses.

Let me see...  I'll keep working on it.  It's like a big puzzle!


I'm not sure about the grapes yet.  I need to figure out where everyone else is first.  

"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the person who ate fried rice lives in the last house, and the person who likes green lives in the first.  Hmm...

I dunno, this is too much thinkin' for me.  I'm just a simple fella.  



"
"Hmm, let me see...

The grapes ain't in the first house, that much I know.  The baseball fella lives in the second one, and the fancy car guy too.  So, the mango guy must be in the first house.

**Answer:** (B) 1 



"
"Let's see...  

The blue person is in the middle house, that's for sure.  And the kiwi person is in the last house.  The apple person has to be in the first house 'cause they're next to the orange person.  

That means the white person has to be in the last house!


**Answer:** (A) 3 
"
"Hmm, let me see...  

So we got two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  

They say the root beer guy lives to the right of the roses.  That means the roses can't be in the house on the right.

Then it says the soccer guy lives right next to the mystery book guy. And the gameboy guy lives before them both.

So, the roses gotta be in the house on the left!


**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Hmm, let's see...  This is kinda tricky.  

So we got four houses, right? And each one has a different kinda car and a different kinda pet.  

*  The minivan is somewhere to the right of the fish guy.
*  The truck is right next to the sedan, but there are two houses between the truck and the dog guy.
*  The fish guy lives right next to the dog guy.

That means the dog guy has to be in the last house, number 4! 

**So the answer is (A).** 



"
"Well, lemme see...  

That blue fella gotta be in one of them houses, right?  And the yellow guy's in the third one.  The clue says blue's gotta be to the right of yellow, so...  

The answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  We know someone lives in each house, and they all wear different shoes, like boots, sandals, and loafers.
*  They also got different pets - a cat, a dog, and a bird.
*  And they like different colors - green, blue, and white.
*  They're eatin' different fruits too - oranges, grapes, and mangos.
*  And they play different sports - basketball, baseball, and cricket.

Hmm...  The clues are sayin' some folks live near each other.  

*  The cricket player is to the right of the orange eater.
*  The baseball player is to the left of the cat lover.
*  The grape eater is to the right of the basketball player.
*  The dog owner is to the left of the green lover.
*  The sandal wearer is to the right of the dog owner.
*  Someone who likes blue lives in the middle house.
*  The loafer wearer is to the right of the grape eater.

*Whew!* That's a lot to keep track of.  

Let me think...  I gotta figure out where the bird keeper lives.  

(After some thought and scribbling)

I think the bird keeper lives in **(B) 3**. 




"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the tennis player lives right next to the bird keeper.  And the bird keeper is somewhere to the right of the golfer.  Hmm...  That means the tennis player can't be in the first house, 'cause there ain't nobody to the right of that.

Let me see...  

(Starts scribbling on a piece of paper, muttering to themself)

Okay, so...  The tennis player can't be in the first house, and they gotta be next to the bird keeper...  That means the tennis player must be in house **2**. 


**Answer: (A)** 





"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It's like tryin' to figure out who's who at a big party, but everyone's got a secret hobby and a favorite snack.  

Hmm...  I'm not real good with all these clues, but I'll give it a shot.  

(After some thought and scribbling on a piece of paper)

I think the history book buff lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

The cellist is next to the guy with the gameboy, but the dog guy ain't in the first house.  So, the dog guy must be in the second house. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Let's see...  

*  Someone's got a minivan in the first house.
*  The gameboy's in the third house.
*  The phone's next to the SUV, and the radio's past the gameboy.

Hmm...  That means the SUV's gotta be in the second house. 

**Answer: (D) 2** 



"
"Okay, lemme see if I can figure this out.  

So, we got five houses, right?  And each one has a different flower and a different gadget.  

*  Someone's got tulips in the third house.
*  The computer's in the second house.
*  The phone's right next to the TV.
*  The lilies are somewhere past the phone.
*  The daffodils ain't in the fourth house.
*  The roses are right next to the carnations.

Hmm...  Let me think...  If the phone's next to the TV, and the tulips are in the third house, then the phone must be in the first house and the TV in the second.

That means the lilies gotta be in the fourth house.  And since the roses are next to the carnations, and the lilies are in the fourth, the carnations must be in the fifth house.



So the answer is **(E) 5**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  We know the cricketer lives in the second house.
*  The golfer is in the fourth house.
*  The bird keeper is in the first house.

Hmm... that's all I got for now.  I'm not real good with all these clues and figuring out who has what.  

I'm gonna need more help to find the dog owner's house.  



"
"Let's see...  

They said the pizza guy ain't in the first house.  And the radio and truck are buddies, gotta be next to each other.  So the pizza guy has to be in the second house.

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Okay, lemme see if I can figure this out.  

So we got four houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it.  They each ate somethin' different for lunch, like grilled cheese, spaghetti, pizza, and fried rice.  And they each like a different color and drink somethin' different too.

Let's see... the tea drinker lives in the first house.  And the pizza guy lives next door.  Hmm... milk comes before spaghetti, and spaghetti comes before the water guy.  That means the milk, spaghetti, and water guys are all together somewhere.

The coffee guy likes somethin' before the yellow guy.  And the green guy doesn't live in the first house.  

Putting it all together... I think the green guy lives in house **4**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the yellow-lover ain't in the last house.  And the dog guy lives in the third house.  Hmm...  

I dunno, this is too much thinkin' for me.  I'm more of a ""go with my gut"" kinda fella.  



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  It's got all these folks and their stuff, and they're all mixed up.  

Let's see...  It says the baseball player is in house number 4.  And the guy with the loafers is in house 4 too.  That's a start!

Hmm...  It says the swimmer is to the left of the milk drinker, and the water drinker is to the right of the milk drinker.  That's kinda tricky.

I dunno, this is makin' my head spin.  Maybe if I just look at the clues one by one...


I'm gonna need a little more time to figure this one out.  It's like tryin' to solve a jigsaw puzzle with all the pieces mixed up! 

"
"Hmm, let's see...

So we got three houses, right?  One guy's a golfer, one's a basketball player, and the other one plays soccer.  They each had different food too - grilled cheese, spaghetti, and pizza.  And they got different flowers in their front rooms - lilies, daffodils, and tulips.

Okay, here's what I got:

* The soccer guy lives in the last house, number 3.
* The tulips ain't in the last house.

* The golfer lives right next to the basketball player.

* The grilled cheese guy is somewhere before the spaghetti guy.

Putting it all together... I think the grilled cheese guy lives in house number 1. 


**Answer:** (A) 1 
"
"Well, lemme see...  It says the fried rice fella lives in one of the houses.  And it says the piano player is in the third house, and that's where the fried rice is too!  So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

*  Someone's drinkin' tea in the third house.
*  Stew's before spaghetti, and the runnin' shoes are before the stew.
*  Water's after the grilled cheese.
*  High heels and water are right next to each other.
*  Root beer's after the sandals.

Hmm...  That means the runnin' shoes gotta be in the second house.  

**So the answer is (B).** 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the radio is in the third house.  And the basketball player is in the last house.  Hmm...  

I dunno, this is too much thinkin' for me.  I'm better at fixin' things than puzzles.  



"
"Hmm, let me see...  

If the fried rice guy is to the right of the sci-fi book guy, then the sci-fi book guy must be in house number 1. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Let's see...  

The pianist is in the first house, that's for sure.  And the root beer drinker is to the right of the horse person.  So the horse person must be in the first house too, right?  

That means the root beer drinker is in the second house.  

The white person ain't in the second house, so they must be in the first.

That leaves the dog person in the second house. 


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 





"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

* Stew is in house number two, and pizza is in house number four.  That's a start!

* The percussionist is somewhere to the right of the sci-fi book guy.  Hmm...

* The guitarist has to be before the violinist, but the violinist can't be in the last house.

*  There are two houses between the fried rice and the fantasy book guy...

*  And the history book guy is after the percussionist.

*Whew!*  This is tough!  I'm gonna need a minute to think about it... 


Let me know if you want me to try again after I chew on it for a bit! 

"
"Hmm, let me see...  This puzzle is kinda tricky.  

So, we got three houses, right?  And each house has a different person livin' in it.  They each got different flowers, colors they like, pets, and shoes.  

The first clue says the person who likes white lives in the first house.  Okay, that's a start.

Then it says the person wearin' boots ain't in the second house.  

And the bird keeper ain't in the last house.

The rest of these clues are kinda confusing, but I think the horse person is in the first house.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Let's see...  

* The apple guy is in the last house, that's for sure.
* The mango guy is right next to the apple guy.
* Coffee ain't in the middle house.
* Apples are in the last house.

So, the coffee guy must be in the first house, and the milk guy has to be in the last house. 


The answer is **(C) 3**. 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  So, there's three houses, right?  One fella in each.
*  They got different shoes, flowers, colors they like, and books they read.
*  We gotta figure out which house the boots are in.

Hmm... let me see what I can do with these clues...

*  The science fiction guy lives in the middle house.
*  The first house has carnations.

Okay, that's a start.  

*  The red guy and the loafer guy live next to each other.
*  The white guy lives next to the tulips.
*  The history book guy lives after the tulips.
*  The boots ain't in the last house.

*  The tulips are before the red guy.

Let me know if you want me to keep tryin'! 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The water fella lives in the first house, right?  And the lily person is in the second one.  That leaves the last house for the rose fella.

"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  We know someone's wearin' loafers in the first house.
*  The yellow fella lives in the third house.
*  And the tennis player's in the third house too.

Hmm... that's all I got for now.  I ain't real good with all these clues and stuff.  

I can't tell ya where the cricketer lives.  



"
"The yellow person lives in house number 1.  That's what it says right there!  


"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right?  One's got a computer, one's got a radio, and one's got a TV.  And each house has different flowers too - carnations, roses, and tulips.  Plus, each person plays a different sport - golf, soccer, and tennis.

Let me see...  

* Someone plays tennis and they live before the TV guy.
* The golfer ain't in the middle house.
* The computer and tulips are right next to each other.
* The radio guy lives after the roses.
* The radio guy lives after the TV guy too.

Hmm...  

I think the computer guy lives in house number **2**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these houses, right? And each one has a person in it.  They all do different stuff, like play music and stuff.  

Let's see...

I think the sandals are in house **2**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

House 2 had the grilled cheese, that's for sure.  And the high heels are next to the fish guy.  So the fish guy must be in house 1.  

That means the stew was in house 2.

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each person likes a different kinda book, has a different pet, and a different favorite color.  Plus, they all got different flowers in their front yard.  

Hmm...  

* We know the romance book lover lives in the last house (number 5).
* And the fish guy lives in the third house.
*  The horses are in the second house.

That's a start!  

Now, we gotta figure out where the cat lover lives.  It's gonna take some thinkin'!  


Let me see...  I'm gonna need more clues to figure out where the cat lover lives.  This puzzle is tougher than it looks! 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the grapes and oranges are right next to each other, and the oranges are to the right of the boots.  Hmm... that means they gotta be in one of these spots:

* Boots, Grapes, Oranges
* Oranges, Grapes, Boots

And the phone is in the third house, and the flutist is there too.  

I dunno, this is tough!  I'm gonna need more clues to figure out where the oranges are. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are four houses, and each person has a different favorite color, food, fruit, and drink.  That's a lot of stuff to keep track of!

I'm gonna need a minute to think about this one.  It's tricky! 




"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the person with the pizza lives in one of these houses, right?  Hmm...  We gotta figure out who's in each house.  

*  The first house has the convertible car.
*  The truck is right next to the mystery book reader.
*  The running shoes are next to the high heels.
*  The fantasy book person is next to the fried rice eater.

**(C)** 
"
"The answer is (B).  

That there, it says right there the person in high heels lives in the second house.

"Hmm, let me see...

The fella in loafers ain't in the first house, so he must be in the second one. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the pizza person is right next to the sandals person.  And the tulips person is right next to the pizza person.  Hmm... that means the tulips, pizza, and sandals folks are all bunched up together.

I dunno, this is too tricky for me.  I'm better at fixin' things than solvin' puzzles like this.  



"
"Let's see...

The fella with the mangos is in the first house, that's for sure.  And the roses are to the left of the lilies, so the roses gotta be in the first house too.  

The sax player ain't in the first house, so they must be in the second house.  

That means the apples gotta be in the second house!


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"That there, the coffee drinker lives in house number 4.  


"
"Let's see...

*  The tulip guy ain't in the last house.
*  The SUV guy lives right next to the lily guy.

*  The roses ain't in the middle house.

Okay, so the roses and sedan must be in the first house.  And the SUV and lilies gotta be next to each other, so they're in the first and second houses. That leaves the truck in the last house.


**Answer: (C)** 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the person with the tulips lives in the last house, and the person with the lilies lives in the fourth house.  Hmm...

That means the milk person can't be in those houses.  

I'm gonna need to think about the rest of the clues...  


Let me get back to ya when I figure it out! 

"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are four houses, and each person likes a different color, plays a different sport, drives a different car, and eats a different fruit.  

Hmm...  The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person with the convertible lives in the last house.  That's a start!

*  House 1: Yellow,  
*  House 4: Convertible

I gotta think...  Maybe if I write down all the sports, cars, and fruits, I can figure it out.  

(The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.)

I'm gonna need a little more time to work this one out.  It's a tough one! 




"
"Let's see...  

*  The green guy lives in the last house.
*  The yellow and green guys live next to each other.
*  The stew guy is right next to the romance guy.

Hmm... that means the yellow guy must be in the middle house.

"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  They say the tulips and the bird keeper are right next to each other.
*  The yellow fella lives in the last house.

"Let's see...

* One house is number one, the other is number two.
* One fella plays the piano, the other plays the cello.
* One likes red, the other likes green.
* One likes mystery books, the other likes fantasy.

The clue says the fantasy book guy lives in the first house.  And the cello player is in the first house too.  

The green guy lives to the left of the red guy, so the green guy must be in the first house.

That means the mystery book guy must be in the second house.


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  It's got all these folks and their stuff mixed up.  

Let's see...  It says someone lives in each house, and they all like different things.  That means we gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.  

I'm not real good with all these clues, but I'll try my best.  

* **Question:** What is the number of the house where the swimmer lives?
   * **(A) 1**
   * **(B) 2**
   * **(C) 4**
   * **(D) 3**
   * **(E) 5**

I dunno... I'm gonna guess **(D) 3**.  



"
"Hmm, let me see...

The golfer is in the middle house, right?  So the swimmer can't be there.  And the history book guy is in the first house.  That means the swimmer must be in the last house.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are four houses, and each person in each house does somethin' different.  They play different sports, eat different foods, like different fruits, and have different pets.  They even like different books!

Hmm...  

*Swirls finger in the air, trying to make sense of it all*

I dunno, this is too much for me.  I'm better at fixin' things than figuring out puzzles like this.  


"
"Hmm, let me see...  

So, one house is on the left, one on the right, right?  One fella eats fried rice, the other eats spaghetti.  One likes cats, the other likes horses.  And one wears sandals, the other wears runnin' shoes.

The fella in sandals lives right next to the horse guy.  And the history book guy lives past the spaghetti guy.

*thinks for a moment, tapping fingers on a table*

Well, the sandals guy's gotta be in the left house, 'cause the horse guy's next to him.  And the history book guy can't be in the left house 'cause the spaghetti guy's gotta be before him.

So, the fried rice guy must be in the right house!


**Answer: (B)** 





"
"Hmm, let me see...

So, one house has lilies and the other has daffodils, right? And one guy plays the flute and the other plays the sax.  

The sedan's gotta be in the house before the lilies, that's what they said.  And the flute player ain't in the first house.

That means the lilies must be in the second house! 

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

Okay, so we got four houses, and each one has a different sport, flowers, and a book.  

*  We know the carnations are in the last house.
*  The roses are in the third house.

Hmm... that helps a little.  

Let me see if I can figure out where the romance book lover lives...  


(After some thought and scribbling)


I think the romance book lover lives in **house 2**.  



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the coffee drinker lives in the third house.  And the milk drinker is in the fifth house.  Hmm...

I dunno, this is too much thinkin' for me.  I'm just a simple fella.  I can't figure out where the tulips are.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Shoes, food, cars, sports, and flowers.

*  Someone's wearin' boots, someone's wearin' high heels, and someone's wearin' runnin' shoes.
*  One had grilled cheese, one had fried rice, and one had pizza for lunch.
*  One drives a minivan, one drives a convertible, and one drives a sedan.
*  One's a cricketer, one's a tennis player, and one's a golfer.
*  One's got roses, one's got tulips, and one's got carnations.

It says there are five houses, and each person has a different drink, instrument, food, and color they like.  

Hmm...  The saxophonist is in the third house, and the flutist is in the second.  That's a start!

*  The coffee drinker is next to the percussionist, but we don't know where they are yet.
*  The person who likes milk is a couple of houses away from the person who likes blue.
*  The person who likes yellow is somewhere before the saxophonist.

It's like a big puzzle!  I'm gonna keep lookin' at these clues and see if I can figure out where everyone lives.


I'm not sure which house the percussionist is in yet.  I need to keep thinkin'! 

"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  They say the fried rice is in the third house. Okay, that's a start.
*  Stew ain't in the second or fourth house.  
*  The blue guy gotta be before the spaghetti guy.
*  And the grilled cheese guy is after the white guy.

Hmm...  I'm not sure how to put it all together.  It's like tryin' to fit puzzle pieces that don't quite match.  



"
"Hmm, let me see...

*  The red guy lives in the last house, that's for sure.
*  The drummer lives in the middle house.
*  The basketball player is somewhere to the right of the tennis player.

So, the basketball player can't be in the last house 'cause the red guy's there.  And the drummer's in the middle, so the basketball player has to be in the first house.


**Answer:** (A) 1 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  It's all about figuring out who lives where, what they like, and what they got.  

Hmm...  It says the computer guy lives right next to the root beer fella.  That's a start.  And the cellist is somewhere past the tulips.  

*scratches head*

This is gonna take a while...  I'm gonna need to write it all down and see if I can connect the dots.  



"
"This here's a real head-scratcher!  It's like tryin' to figure out who done stole the pie, but with houses and stuff instead.  

I ain't no good with all these fancy words and numbers, but I can tell ya this:  

*  It's all about lookin' for clues that tell ya somethin' for sure. Like, if it says the sax player lives next to the sci-fi fan, well, you know they gotta be together somewhere.

*  Then you gotta start thinkin' about what else could be near 'em.  Maybe the person with the roses likes sci-fi too, who knows?

*  It's like a puzzle, ya gotta put the pieces together one by one.

Now, about that minivan... I ain't sure which house it's in.  I'd need to look at all the clues real close.  



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each person has different stuff like a radio, a car, flowers, and a pet.  

Hmm...  

* We know the dog owner lives in the second house. 
* And someone with fish lives in the third house.

That's a start!  

Now, it says the minivan ain't in the third house.  And the person with the gameboy lives before the person with the radio.  

*  I'm gonna need more clues to figure out where the tulips are!  


I'm not sure which house has the tulips.  Can you give me some more hints? 

"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em.  And each one's got someone livin' in it.  They all got different stuff they like.  

Let's see...

* One likes cats, one likes dogs, and one likes fish.
* One had spaghetti, one had stew, and one had pizza for lunch.
* One plays basketball, one plays cricket, and one plays tennis.
* One plays the sax, one plays the guitar, and one plays the violin.
* One drinks tea, one drinks milk, and one only drinks water.

And there's some clues to help us figure out who lives where:

1. The cat person ain't right next to the guitar player.
2. The tea drinker lives right next to the cricket player.
3. The water drinker ain't right next to the fish person.
4. The pizza eater lives right next to the dog person.
5. The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. The sax player lives in the first house.
7. The stew eater lives before the milk drinker.

Hmm...  

Well, we know the basketball player and the sax player are in the first house.  And the tea drinker is next to the cricket player, so they gotta be in the second and third houses.  

The pizza eater is next to the dog eater, so the pizza eater is in the first house and the dog eater is in the second house.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 




"
"Hmm, let me see...  

That first house has the history books, right?  And the high heels are to the left of the daffodils.  So, the high heels must be in the first house.  

That means the lilies are in the first house too!

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the person with apples lives in the third house.  That's a start.  And the first house has carnations.  Hmm...

I'm not real good with all these clues, but I'll try my best.  It says the pizza person is somewhere to the right of the sax player.  And the pizza person ain't in the last house.  

*scratches head*

This is tough!  I need more clues!  



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are four houses, and each person has a different color they like, a different instrument they play, different flowers, and different food they ate.  And they all like different kinds of books too!  

Hmm...  It's like a big ol' mess!  

*  The history book guy lives in the second house. That's a start!
*  The fantasy book guy lives in the last house.

I dunno, it's hard to keep track of all these clues.  Maybe if we write 'em down...


Let me think...  I'm gonna need a minute to figure this out.  


(After some time, looking confused)

I'm still stuck!  This puzzle is too hard for me.  I give up! 




"
"Hmm, let me see...  

So we got three houses, right?  One guy plays the violin, one plays the flute, and one plays the piano.  And they each got different fruits too.  

*  The piano guy and the kiwi guy live right next to each other.
*  The flute guy lives past the violin guy.
*  There's one house between the grape guy and the kiwi guy.
*  There's one house between the violin guy and the kiwi guy.

Let me think...  If the piano guy and kiwi guy are together, and the flute guy is past the violin guy... that means the piano guy must be in the last house!

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

The fantasy book person don't live in the first house, that much I know. And the kiwi eater lives in the first house.  So the fantasy book person must be in the second house.

(B) 2 



"
"Well, lemme see...  

That there puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  But I think I got it.  

The person who likes red lives in house number **(D) 3**. 

I figured it out by lookin' at all the clues and tryin' to match 'em up.  It took a while, but I got there! 



"
"Hmm, let me see...  The root beer guy ain't in the second house, that much I know. And the piano player's gotta be next to the cello player.  So, the root beer guy must be in the first house. 

**Answer:** (A) 1 



"
"Let's see...  This is kinda like a puzzle ya know?  

Okay, so we got five houses, and each one has a different kinda shoe and a different kinda flower.  

*  Someone's wearin' boots, someone's wearin' fancy shoes, someone's wearin' loafers, someone's wearin' runnin' shoes, and someone's wearin' sandals.
*  And they got roses, lilies, daffodils, carnations, and tulips.

The clues are like hints to figure out who lives where.  

Hmm...  Let me see...

*  Boots and carnations are next to each other.
*  Tulips are to the left of loafers.
*  Sandals ain't in the last house.
*  Runnin' shoes and daffodils are next to each other.
*  Tulips are to the right of daffodils.
*  Tulips ain't in the fourth house.
*  Carnations are in the last house.

*  

Okay, so the last house has carnations.  That means boots are in the house before that.  

And tulips gotta be before loafers, and they can't be in the fourth house.  

Runnin' shoes and daffodils are together, and tulips are to the right of daffodils.

So, the lilies must be in the second house.



**Answer: (D)** 
"
"This puzzle sounds tricky!  I ain't no brain surgeon, but I'm good at followin' directions.  Let me see if I can make sense of it...

It's got a lotta rules, but I'll try my best to keep track.  

*Four houses, huh?*  That's easy enough.

*Each one's got a different person, instrument, color, sport, fruit, and drink?*  

Whew, that's a mouthful!  

I'll need to read those clues real careful.  

(After carefully reading the clues)

Hmm... this is tough!  I'm gettin' a headache just tryin' to keep it all straight.  

I don't know which house the pianist lives in.  Maybe you could give me a hint? 




"
"Okay, lemme see if I can figure this out. 

So we got three houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it.  They each ate somethin' different for lunch, like spaghetti, fried rice, or stew.  And they each like a different color, white, green, or red.  Oh, and they each wear different shoes, boots, runnin' shoes, or high heels.

Let's see...  

*  The first house has someone who likes white.
*  The second house has someone who likes green.
*  The person in high heels don't live in the last house.

Hmm... that's all I can really figure out right now.  

I dunno which house the fried rice is in.  


"
"Let's see...  

*  The rose fella lives in the second house.
*  The sci-fi guy is right next to the rose fella, so he's in the first house.
*  The fantasy book guy is to the left of the sci-fi guy, so he's in the fourth house.
*  The romance book guy is right next to the tulips guy, and the fantasy guy is in the last house, so the romance guy must be in the third house.
*  The romance guy is to the right of the carnation guy, so the carnation guy must be in the first house.

That leaves the lilies for the fourth house!


**Answer: (C)** 




"
"Hmm, let me see...

The science fiction guy lives in the first house, right?  And the coffee drinker is to the left of the sandals guy.  So, the romance book lover must be in the first house. 

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Hmm, let me see...  

So, one fella plays the drums, the other plays the piano, right? And one guy has a radio, the other has a phone.  

The drummer lives right next to the guy with the radio.  

That means the phone guy must be in house number 1. 

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  

* House 1, House 2, House 3.

And folks livin' in 'em like different colors and cars.

* One likes white, one likes blue, one likes yellow.
* One drives a minivan, one a convertible, one a sedan.

Here's what we know:

* The guy with the convertible lives in House 2.

And then it gets a little tricky:

* Someone who likes white lives next to the guy with the sedan, but not in the same house.
* The yellow guy lives right next to the sedan guy.

Hmm... let me think...

If the convertible's in House 2, the yellow guy and sedan guy gotta be in Houses 1 and 3.  And the yellow guy's gotta be in House 1 'cause he's next to the sedan guy.

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the person with the runnin' shoes lives in the first house.  And the sedan's in the third house.  Hmm...

I dunno, this is gettin' kinda tricky.  I'm not real good with all these clues and stuff.  Maybe if we just start fillin' in the blanks, somethin' will jump out at us. 



"
"This here's a tough one!  It's like tryin' to figure out who's who at a big ol' party, but everyone's got different flowers, cars, and snacks.  

Let's see...  They say the fella with the convertible lives in the first house.  That's a start!  And the bird keeper's in the first house too.  Hmm...

I'm gonna need a bit more time to sort this out.  It's like tryin' to find a needle in a haystack!  



"
"Hmm, let me see...

So we got three houses, right?  One fella eats fried rice, one eats spaghetti, and one eats grilled cheese.  

They also like different books, huh?  One likes sci-fi, one likes fantasy, and one likes mysteries.

Okay, here's what I got:

*  The spaghetti guy lives to the left of the fried rice guy.
*  The fried rice guy lives to the right of the sci-fi guy.
*  Fried rice is in the middle house.
*  The fantasy book guy is in the middle house too.

That means the fried rice guy and the fantasy book guy are the same person, and they're in the middle house.

So, the grilled cheese guy must be in the last house.

The answer is **(C)**. 





"
"Hmm, let me see...  Carnations are pretty flowers, right?  And the dog owner lives to the right of the carnations. So, the carnations must be in house number 1. 

(B) 1 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

The person with the kiwis lives in the second house, right?  And the one with the water lives right next to the high heels.  So, the high heels gotta be in the second house too!


(B) 2 
"
"Hmm, let me see...

So we got two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  

One fella's got high heels, the other's got sandals. The high heels guy's gotta be on the left 'cause the sandals guy's next to the grapes.  

That means the grapes are in the left house too.  

The only fruit left is kiwis, so that means the kiwis must be in the right house.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Let's see...  

The tea guy's in the first house, that's for sure.  

The water guy's gotta be somewhere past the cellist, right?  And the violin and guitar can't be right next to each other.  

Hmm...  That means the guitar player's gotta be in the last house!


**Answer:** (C) 3 
"
"Well, lemme see...  

That there clue says the person wearin' sandals is in the third house. And it says the water drinker is right next to 'em. So the water drinker must be in the fourth house. 

The answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"This puzzle is kinda tricky, but I'll give it a shot.  Let's see...

*  They say the pizza guy is in house number 4.  
*  And the computer guy ain't in house 4.

Hmm... that means the computer guy must be in one of the other houses.  

I dunno, this is gettin' confusing.  I'm not real good with all these clues.  



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each person has a different job, eats a different fruit, and has a different pet.  

Hmm...  

*  The tennis player is in the first house. That's a good start!
*  The bird keeper is in the second house. 
*  The percussionist is in the fourth house.

Now, I gotta figure out where the banana eater is...  

Let me see...  

(After some thought and looking over the clues)

I think the banana eater is in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Let's see...  

One house has the pizza, the other has the grilled cheese.  The bird guy ain't in the second house, and the drummer ain't in the second house neither.  

So, the pizza must be in house 2! 

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"That there fella lives in house number 3.  The clue says so right there!  



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the cat person lives in the first house.  That's a start.  

Hmm,  it also says the person with the loafers ain't in the middle house.  And the music guy with the drums ain't in the middle house neither.  

*scratches head*

This is gonna take a while...  I'm gonna need to think real hard about all these clues.  


Let me know if you want me to keep tryin'! 
"
"Hmm, this is a tricky one.  Let's see...

We know someone's eatin' grapes in the second house.  That's a start.  

The rest is kinda jumbled.  Red and green gotta be next to each other, but we don't know where.  And someone likes white, and someone likes yellow, but we don't know who or where they are.

I'm gonna guess... maybe the kiwis are in house 4?  It's the furthest away from the grapes, and that might make sense with some of the other clues.


**(A) 4** 





"
"Hmm, this is a tricky one.  Let's see...

So we got two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  

* One fella had stew, the other had fried rice.
* One likes horses, the other likes cats.
* One's munchin' on oranges, the other's got apples.
* One reads mystery books, the other likes sci-fi stuff.
* And one's wearin' runnin' shoes, the other's got sandals.

Now, they say the runnin' shoes are to the right of the oranges.  And the mystery book guy lives right next to the cat guy.  And the mystery book guy and the stew guy are buddies, always hangin' out together.

*Sniffs*  

Hmm...  I think the stew guy lives in **house 2**.  



"
"Let's see...  

*  The root beer guy is in the first house, that's for sure.
*  The water drinker is in the middle house.
*  The TV ain't in the middle house.
*  The TV is to the right of the tulips.

So, the milk guy must be in the last house with the TV and the tulips. 

**Answer: (A)**

"This puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I got it!

*  Someone in the first house wears loafers, that's for sure.
*  The phone guy is somewhere to the left of the mango eater.

*  The boot guy ain't in the last house.
*  The kiwi guy is right next to the milk guy.

Hmm...  I think the computer guy is in **house 2**.  



"
"Let's see...  

So we got three houses, right?  And each house has a different person, a different sport, and different flowers and pets.  

Hmm...  The golfer ain't in the last house.  And the fish guy lives before the horse guy.  

The carnation guy and the horse guy are right next to each other.  And the carnation guy is before the baseball guy.

That means the carnation guy, horse guy, and baseball guy are together somewhere.

The rose guy is before the daffodil guy.

So, the horse guy must be in house number **2**. 


**Answer: (C) 2** 
"
"Let's see...  

* The fella with the oranges lives in the first house.
* The horse owner is in the last house.
* The truck driver is next to the convertible driver.
* The mango guy ain't in the last house.
* The mango guy and the convertible guy live next to each other.

**(A) 2** 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each person has a different instrument, book, and lunch.  Hmm...

*  The percussionist lives right next to the stew eater.
*  The guitarist is right next to the percussionist.
*  The science fiction fan is somewhere before the percussionist.

Okay, so maybe the percussionist is in house number 4?  That'd put the guitarist in 3 and the science fiction fan somewhere before that.

I dunno, this is tough!  I'm gonna need more clues to figure out for sure.

But then the tulips person would have to be in the first house, which can't be right 'cause the tulips person is to the right of the dog person.

* The banana person ain't in the third house.

* The banana person lives right next to the dog person.

*  The phone guy is right next to the runner shoes guy.

Hmm...  

The apple guy is in the first house, and there's one house between him and the sandals guy.  

So, the phone guy must be in the first house!


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"The bird keeper lives in house number 2.  That's what it says right there in the clues! 


"
"Hmm, let's see...  

So we got two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  

* One fella likes tea, the other only drinks water.
* One likes romance books, the other likes sci-fi stuff.
* One plays drums, the other plays that sax thing.
* One plays golf, the other plays baseball.
* One's munchin' on mangos, the other's got grapes.

Okay, here's what I got:

* The tea guy and the grape guy live right next to each other.
* The sax guy and the golfer live right next to each other.
* The baseball guy and the grape guy live right next to each other.
* The sax guy lives in the first house.
* The romance book guy and the golfer live right next to each other.

Let me think...  If the sax guy is in the first house, and the golfer's next to him, then the golfer must be in the second house.  

That means the mangos must be in the second house!


**Answer: (A)** 




"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  It's all about figuring out who lives where, what they like, and what they do.  

I'm not real good with all that fancy thinkin', but I can try.  

*  We know someone eats apples and lives in the fourth house. That's a start!
*  And someone with runnin' shoes lives in the first house.

Hmm...  It's like a big ol' puzzle with lots of pieces.  I need more clues to figure out where the romance book lover lives.  



"
"The boots are in house number one.  That's what it says right there!  (A) 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each person has different stuff they like.  We gotta figure out where the tea drinker lives.  Hmm...

*  Coffee ain't in the fourth house.
*  Root beer is next to high heels.
*  Basketball and tennis are buddies, living next to each other.
*  Spaghetti is next to loafers.
*  Tea is next to pizza.
*  Soccer is after stew.
*  Pizza is before cricket.
*  Grilled cheese ain't in the last house.
*  Water is before tea.
*  Water is before grilled cheese.
*  Cricket is after sandals.
*  Root beer is before water.
*  Boots are next to basketball.
*  Stew is before tennis.

Whew! That's a lot of clues!  Let me see if I can make sense of it all...

(After some thought and scribbling)

I think the tea drinker lives in **house 2**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says the person who likes blue lives right next to the one who had pizza.  And the tea drinker lives in the first house.  Hmm...  

I'm not real good with all these clues, but I'll try my best.  

(After some thought and scribbling)

I think the person who likes green lives in house **(E) 4**. 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says someone ate fried rice, and we gotta figure out which house they lived in.  Hmm...  There's a lot of clues about cars and flowers and stuff, but I'm gonna focus on the fried rice clue.

It says the fried rice eater ain't in the fourth house.  That narrows it down a bit.  

Let me see...  I gotta keep lookin' at all the clues and see if anything else pops out about the fried rice person.  


I'm gonna need a little more time to figure this one out.  It's tricky! 

"
"Okay, lemme see...  

So we got two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  Two folks livin' there, each one different.

One likes red, one likes yellow. One eats oranges, one eats grapes. One reads mysteries, one reads fantasy. One drives a truck, one drives a fancy car. And one wears boots, one wears runnin' shoes.

Now, here's what we know:

* The grape eater lives right next to the truck driver.
* The boot wearer lives right next to the mystery reader.
* The yellow liker lives right next to the truck driver.

Hmm...  Let's think... If the yellow one is next to the truck, and the grapes are next to the truck too... that means the yellow one must be eatin' grapes!

And if the boots are next to the mystery reader... that means the fantasy reader must be in the other house!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 




"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...  

It says there are five houses, and each person has a different color they like, a different kind of car, ate something different for lunch, and likes a different kind of book.  Whew! That's a lot of stuff to keep track of.

The clues are kinda tricky, but I'll try my best.  

*  Hmm, the history book buff is to the left of the stew eater...  
*  And there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the stew eater...

I'm gonna need a piece of paper and a pencil to write all this down.  

(After some scribbling and muttering)

I think the person who ate fried rice lives in house number **(B) 4**.  



"
"Hmm, let's see...  

They say the fella who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.  And the golfer's in the last one.  

That means the pizza guy can't be in the first or last house.  So, he must be in the second house.

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

So we got three houses, right?  One guy in each.  One plays the fancy string thing, one plays the drums, and one plays the... whatchamacallit... the one with the ball and the net.

The string guy lives past the cricket guy, that's for sure.  And the basketball guy is in the middle house.  

That means the string guy must be in the last house, and the cricket guy is in the first one.  

So the soccer guy must be in the first house!


**Answer: (A) 1** 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

*  We know the mystery book reader lives in the last house.
*  And the water drinker is also in the last house.

Hmm... that means the last house has two things going on.

*  We also know the fantasy book reader is right next to the mystery book reader.

So, the fantasy book reader must be in the second to last house.

*  The green lover lives right before the coffee drinker.

*  The history book lover lives right before the lilies.

*  The white lover doesn't live in the third house.

*  The daffodils aren't in the first house.

*  Carnations aren't in the last house.

*  Carnations are somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.

*  The tea drinker is somewhere to the right of the red lover.

*  

I'm gonna need a minute to think about all this...  It's a lot of clues!  


Let me know if you want me to keep trying! 





"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  Let's see...

*  They say the coffee drinker is in the last house.

*  The tennis player ain't in the last house.

*  The dog person and the root beer person are right next to each other.

*  The fish person is somewhere to the right of the basketball person.

*  The water person and the tennis person are right next to each other.

Let me know if you want me to keep trying! 

"
"Hmm, let me see...  

The pianist is in house number 2, and the daffodil person lives right next to 'em.  So the daffodil person must be in house number 1.

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Okay, lemme see if I can figure this out.  

So, we got five houses, right?  And each one has a different kinda fruit, car, and flowers.  

*  The first house has oranges.
*  The fourth house has bananas and a big ol' SUV.
*  The person with the daffodils lives right next to the minivan. That means the daffodils are in the third house and the minivan is in the fifth.

Hmm...  Let's see, the apples are next to the daffodils, so the apples must be in the second house.  

*  The sedan has to be somewhere after the carnations, and the only place left for that is the third house.



So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

So we got two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  

The soccer player is in the second house, that's for sure.  

And the blue guy is right next to the root beer guy.  

The root beer guy can't be in the first house 'cause the soccer player is there.  

So the root beer guy must be in the second house!


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let me see...

"
"Let's see...  Boots are in the second house, that's for sure.  And the fancy car is in the last house.  The cat fella lives in the first one.  Hmm...  That leaves the runnin' shoes for the first house, I reckon.

"
"Let's see...  

They say the tea guy lives in the last house.  And the flowers in the first house are carnations.

**Answer:** (C) 1
