"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the flutist lives in the second house.  

Then we know the tulips are next to the guitarist, and the lilies are next to the carnations.  

So, it has to look something like this:

* House 1:  
* House 2: Flutist
* House 3:  
* House 4:  

Since the tulips are next to the guitarist, and the lilies and carnations are together, the tulips must be in house 1!


The answer is **(C) 1**. 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the cellist lives.

First, let's make a little table to keep track of everything:

| House | Fruit   | Drink   | Color | Instrument | Device   |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|------------|----------|
| 1     |         |         | Green |            |          |
| 2     |         |         |       |            |          |
| 3     |         |         |       |            |          |

We know the person who likes green lives in the first house, and they're eating kiwis.  

Now let's look at the clues:

*  The root beer lover lives to the left of the grape eater.
*  The TV person lives to the left of the root beer lover.
*  The water drinker lives to the left of the root beer lover.

This means the order has to be: water, TV, root beer, grapes.

* There's one house between the cellist and the gameboy person.
* The blue person and the gameboy person live next to each other.

Hmm, that's a lot to think about!  We'll need to keep working through the clues and see what else we can figure out. 


Let me know if you want to try working through more clues together! 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the person who likes green lives.

First, I'd write down the houses 1 through 5 and make some columns for fruit, drink, shoes, sport, and color.  Then I'd start filling in what I know from the clues.

*  Clue 5 says the kiwi eater lives in house 5.
*  Clue 15 says the tennis player is in house 5 too.
*  Clue 7 says the person who likes red is in house 2.

Now, I'd keep going with the other clues, trying to figure out where everyone else lives. It might take a while, but if I keep working through them carefully, I bet I can find the answer! 


Let me know if you want to give me more clues! 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the tea drinker lives.

Here's what we know:

* **House 1:**  Someone is eating apples.
* **House 3:** Someone is wearing high heels.

We also know some stuff about where people live based on what they like:

* The truck driver lives next to the SUV owner, but not next to the tea drinker.
* The person wearing loafers lives next to the convertible driver.
* The pizza eater lives before the coffee drinker.
* The root beer lover lives before the person wearing running shoes.

Hmm...  It looks like the tea drinker has to be in **House 2**.  

Let me know if you want to try figuring out the rest! 



"
"The answer is **(A) 5**.  

The clue says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.  
"
"Okay, so we have three houses and we need to figure out where the person with daffodils lives.  

Let's break down the clues:

* **Clue 1:** The soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges.
* **Clue 2:** The swimmer and the person with daffodils live next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** The person with tulips lives to the right of the person eating mangos.
* **Clue 4:** The person with daffodils lives to the right of the person eating oranges.

Hmm...  If we think about it, the daffodils can't be in house 1 because the soccer player is to the left of the orange eater, and the daffodils are to the right of the orange eater.  

That means the daffodils have to be in either house 2 or 3.  But clue 2 says the swimmer and daffodils live next to each other, so they can't be in house 3.

**So the answer is (B) 2!** 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the violinist lives in the first house.  

Then we know the tulips and the phone are next to each other, but not in the first house.  

And the history book person lives to the right of the tulips.

So, the only place the tulips can be is in the third house!


**Answer:** (A) 3 
"
"Okay, so we have this puzzle with three houses and people with different stuff.  Let's see if we can figure out where the gameboy lives!

Here's what we know:

*  Someone in each house has a gameboy, a phone, or a computer.
*  Someone in each house has carnations, lilies, or roses.
*  Someone in each house plays the flute, drums, or cello.
*  Someone in each house has horses, a bird, or fish.
*  Someone in each house likes history, romance, or mystery books.

And here are the clues:

1. The bird keeper doesn't live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. The bird keeper doesn't live in the third house.
4. The history book buff lives right next to the person with lilies.
5. The drummer lives right next to the person with a computer.
6. The fish enthusiast doesn't live in the first house.
7. The gameboy owner lives right next to the person with roses.
8. The cellist doesn't live in the third house.

Hmm... let me think.  Since the mystery book reader is in house 2, and the gameboy is next to the roses, the gameboy must be in **house 1**. 




**So the answer is (A).** 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle!  It's like a detective game where you have to figure out who lives where.  

Let's break it down. We have five houses, and each person has a different fruit, pet, device, and flower.  We need to use the clues to figure out where the person with the phone lives.

Here's what I'd do:

1. **Make a table:** I'd draw a table with columns for House Number, Fruit, Pet, Device, and Flower.

2. **Start with the easy clues:**  Look for clues that tell you exactly where someone lives or what they have. For example, if a clue says ""The person who owns horses lives in the third house,"" we can write that down right away.

3. **Look for clues that tell us about neighbors:** Clues like ""There is one house between..."" or ""The dog owner lives directly left of..."" can help us figure out who lives next to each other.

4. **Keep trying:**  It might take a while to figure it all out, but keep using the clues and trying to connect the dots.  

I'm not sure which house the phone is in yet, but if we keep working through the clues, we'll find out! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person wears sandals, the other wears boots.
* One person likes mystery books, the other likes history books.
* One person drives a convertible, the other drives a truck.

And here are the clues:

1. The convertible driver lives right next to the history book reader.
2. The person wearing boots doesn't live in the first house.

Hmm...  If the convertible driver is next to the history book reader, they must be in houses 1 and 2.  Since the boots wearer isn't in house 1, they must be in house 2.  

So, the person wearing sandals must live in **House 1 (A)**! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The golfer lives in the first house.
* The swimmer lives right next to the person who likes romance books.
* The mystery book fan lives right next to the history book fan.
* The basketball player doesn't live in the last house.

Hmm...  Let's think about where the swimmer and romance reader could be. They have to be together, and they can't be in the third house. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3.

Since the basketball player isn't in the last house, and the golfer is in the first, the basketball player must live in house **4**.




**So the answer is (C).** 
"
"The mystery book reader lives in house number 3!  

That's what clue number 3 says.  
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know these things:

* Someone has a phone, someone has a computer, and someone has a Gameboy.
* Someone likes yellow, someone likes blue, and someone likes green.

And here are the clues:

1. The green person lives right next to the Gameboy person.
2. The Gameboy person lives right next to the computer person.
3. The yellow person doesn't live in the middle house.

Hmm...  If the Gameboy person is next to the computer person, and the green person is next to the Gameboy person, then the order has to be: Green - Gameboy - Computer.

Since the yellow person can't be in the middle, the only way this works is:

* House 1: Green, Phone
* House 2: Yellow, Computer
* House 3: Blue, Gameboy


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 




"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

It's like a detective game! We have to use the clues to figure out where everyone lives.

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.

So, the third house is already pretty full!

Now let's look at the other clues and see what we can figure out. It might take a little time, but we can do it! 


Let me know if you want to go through the clues together, step-by-step.  

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The fantasy book person lives in house 1.
* Pizza wasn't eaten in house 1.
* The green-lover lives right next to the radio person.
* The fish person doesn't live in house 1.

So, the green-lover must be in house 2 because the radio person is next to them.  

Since the pizza person isn't in house 1, they must be in house 2 too.  

That means the cat lover must also be in house 2!


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"Wow, this is a tricky puzzle!  It's like a giant game of detective.  

Here's how I'd try to solve it:

1. **Make a Table:** I'd draw a table with the houses numbered 1 to 5, and then columns for each thing they like (pets, books, food, colors, drinks).

2. **Fill in the Obvious:**  I'd start with the clues that tell us exactly where something is. Like, we know the dog owner lives in house 2.

3. **Look for Clues That Connect Things:**  Clues like ""The milk drinker lives left of the blue person"" help me figure out where those two people might be.

4. **Keep Guessing and Checking:**  Sometimes I'd have to make a guess and see if it fits with the other clues. If it doesn't, I'd try something else!

It's gonna take a while to figure out where the water drinker lives, but I'm up for the challenge! 


Let me know if you want to work through some of the clues together.  Maybe we can figure it out! 

"
"The answer is **(A) 1**.  

Clue 8 says the person eating kiwis lives in the first house.  That's pretty straightforward! 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd make a table to keep track of everything:

| House | Fruit | Lunch | Flower |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |   |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |
| 4 |   |   |   |
| 5 |   |   |   |

Now let's use the clues:

* **Clue 1:** The rose is next to the grilled cheese.
* **Clue 6:** Pizza is next to the grilled cheese.
* **Clue 4:** Stew and grilled cheese are next to each other.
* **Clue 7:** Grilled cheese is next to spaghetti.
* **Clue 8:** Grilled cheese and tulips are next to each other.

Hmm, that's a lot of ""next to"" clues!  It seems like grilled cheese is kind of the center of things.  

We also know tulips and daffodils aren't in house 5.

I'm going to keep trying to put the clues together. It might take a while! 


Let me know if you want to work on it together! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The cat lover is in the first house.
* The tulip person is right next to the dog person.
* The daffodil person isn't in the second house.
* There's one house between the horse person and the carnation person.
* The lily person is to the right of the horse person.

Hmm...  Let me see if I can put the pieces together.

Since the cat lover is in the first house, and the tulip person is next to the dog person, the tulip person must be in the second house.  That means the dog person is in the third house.

The daffodil person can't be in the second house, so they must be in the fourth house.

That leaves the horse person and the lily person.  Since the lily person is to the right of the horse person, and the daffodil person is in the fourth house, the horse person must be in the third house and the lily person in the fourth.

The only pet left is the fish, so the fish enthusiast must live in the first house.



**Answer:** The fish enthusiast lives in house **(C) 1**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the person with the phone lives in the first house.
*  The person in boots doesn't live in the second house.
*  The horse owner and the person with the radio are neighbors.

So, since the phone is in the first house, the horse owner and the radio person must be in the second house.  That means the person wearing high heels must live in **House 2**. 


**Answer:** (A) 2 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

We have to figure out which house the person who likes green lives in.  We know some stuff about each house:

* **Who lives there:**  There's one person in each house.
* **What they wear:** One person has sandals, one has boots, and one has loafers.
* **What they like:** One person likes blue, one likes green, and one likes yellow.
* **What they eat:** One person eats apples, one eats grapes, and one eats mangos.
* **What they had for lunch:** One had grilled cheese, one had pizza, and one had fried rice.
* **What they have:** One person has a computer, one has a phone, and one has a radio.

And here are the clues:

1. The grilled cheese and computer person live next to each other.
2. Grilled cheese isn't in the third house.
3. Apples aren't in the first house.
4. Grapes are to the right of boots.
5. Blue and phone are one house apart.
6. Loafers aren't in the third house.
7. Pizza isn't in the second house.
8. Mangos are to the left of yellow.
9. Loafers and computer are next to each other.
10. Computer is to the left of phone.

Let's start writing down what we know in a table, maybe that will help! 

(At this point, the student would start creating a table to organize the information.  They would continue to use the clues to fill in the table, making deductions and eliminating possibilities.)

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The baseball player is in house number 2.
* The tennis player lives right next to the cat lover.

That means the tennis player must be in house 1 and the cat lover in house 2.

We also know:

* The basketball player isn't in the first house and is to the left of the swimmer.
* The fish person lives to the right of the dog person.
* The bird person isn't in the first or third house.

Thinking it through, the only place left for the bird person is house 4!


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd write down the houses and make some columns for the colors, cars, instruments, devices, and sports.  

Then, I'd start using the clues.  

*  Clue 3 tells us the sedan and SUV are next to each other.  So, I'd write that down in my grid.

* Clue 2 says there's one house between the baseball player and the blue-lover.  That gives us a little more to work with.

I'd keep going like that, trying to figure out where each person lives based on the clues. It might take a while, but if we keep working at it, we can solve it!

"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd write down the houses and what we know about each one:

* **House 1:**  
* **House 2:**  
* **House 3:**  

Then, I'd use the clues to fill in some blanks.  

* Clue 1 tells us the pianist doesn't live in the first house.
* Clue 2 says the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person eating kiwis.
* Clue 3 says the person in high heels and the pianist live next to each other.
* Clue 4 says the person in running shoes and the percussionist live next to each other.
* Clue 5 says the person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person wearing boots.
* Clue 6 says the person with the radio lives to the left of the person wearing high heels.
* Clue 7 says the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with the television.

Hmm, this is getting confusing!  I'd keep looking for clues that can help me figure out where everyone lives.  

I'm not sure I can solve it without more hints, though.  



"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's break it down.  

We have five houses, and each person has a different car, drink, fruit, and color they like.  We need to figure out where the person with the sedan lives.

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 2:** The person with apples lives in the third house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

That means the person who likes milk and the person with apples are the same person!

Now we can start using the other clues to figure out where everyone else lives. It's like a big game of connect the dots!

Let me think...  

* **Clue 4:** The milk drinker and the banana eater live next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** The water drinker lives right before the yellow-lover.

I'm gonna need to keep working through these clues one by one. It might take a while, but I'm determined to solve this! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  Someone in the first house eats kiwis.
*  The truck driver doesn't live in the first house.
*  The truck driver and the SUV owner don't live in the third house.

So, the truck driver must live in the second house.  Since the SUV owner can't live in the third house, they must live in the second house!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
*  The swimmer lives in the first house.
*  The person who ate spaghetti lives right next to the person who ate fried rice.

So, the spaghetti eater must live in the second house!


The answer is **(B) 2**. 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd write down the houses from 1 to 5 and make some columns for the car, color, and shoes.  

Then, I'd start filling in what we know for sure. We know the person who likes blue lives in house 5. And the person who likes white lives in house 4.

Now, let's look at the clues about the truck, sandals, loafers, and boots.  They tell us these things have to be in a certain order.  We know the truck is not in house 4, and it's to the left of the sandals.  

We also know the person wearing boots lives to the left of the truck.  So, we can start putting those together.

It's like a puzzle where you have to fit the pieces together!  We need to keep looking at the clues and see how they connect.  

It might take a while, but if we keep working at it, we can figure out where everyone lives!

"The history book buff lives in house number 1!  Clue number 2 says so.  


"
"Wow, this is a tough puzzle!  It's like a giant game of detective.  

Here's what I would do:

1. **Make a Table:** I'd draw a big table with columns for each house number (1 to 5) and then columns for the instrument, fruit, sport, book, and lunch.

2. **Fill in the Obvious:** I'd start by writing down anything we know for sure from the clues. Like, we know the soccer player is in house 1.

3. **Look for Clues that Connect Things:**  Some clues say things like ""The fantasy book person lives to the right of the swimmer."" That means I'd look for places where I could put those two things next to each other in my table.

4. **Use Process of Elimination:** If I know the cellist can't be in house 3, I can cross that house off my list for the cellist.

5. **Keep Trying:** This puzzle takes time! I'd keep looking for clues that connect things and using process of elimination until I figure out where everyone lives.

We know:

* The cricketer lives in the first house.
* The horse owner is next to the sedan owner.
* The truck driver is to the right of the basketball player.
* The cat lover is to the right of the sedan owner.

Hmm...  Since the cricketer is in house 1, the horse owner must be in house 2 and the sedan owner in house 3.  That means the cat lover is in house 3 too!  

The truck driver can't be in house 3 because the basketball player has to be somewhere before the truck driver.  So the basketball player must be in house 2.


The answer is **(B) 2**.

"Okay, so we have this puzzle with five houses and a bunch of stuff about the people who live there.  It's like a detective game!

To solve it, we need to figure out where each person lives based on the clues.  It's kinda like a big puzzle where we have to match things up.

Here's what I'd do:

1. **Make a table:** I'd draw a table with the house numbers (1 to 5) and then columns for each thing they have: a device, a pet, an instrument, a car, and flowers.

2. **Fill in the easy stuff:**  Look for clues that tell us exactly where something is. For example, if a clue says ""The radio is in the fourth house,"" we can write that down right away.

3. **Look for clues that connect things:**  Sometimes clues will say something like ""The person with the tulips lives to the right of the saxophonist."" That means we know they can't be next to each other, and we can start figuring out where they might be.

4. **Keep trying:** It might take a while to figure it all out, but keep using the clues and trying to connect things.  

It's like a big brain teaser!

* The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
* The cellist lives right before the tea drinker.

* We know the minivan is in the fourth house.
* And the root beer lover is in the third house.

Hmm...  

* The basketball player lives right before the truck driver, and the truck driver lives right before the carnations.  
* The tennis player is somewhere before the tea drinker.

* The lilies and daffodils live next to each other, and the lilies are after the basketball player.

* The swimmer lives right before the sedan.

* The tea drinker lives in the first house.
* The apple eater is to the left of the minivan driver.
* The convertible driver is to the right of the science fiction fan.
* There's one house between the fantasy book person and the coffee drinker.
* The orange eater doesn't live in the second house.

Hmm...  Let's try to put the pieces together. Since the tea drinker is in the first house, and the apple eater is to the left of the minivan driver, the apple eater must be in the first house too.

That means the orange eater can't be in the second house.  

The only place left for the science fiction fan is the third house, so the convertible driver must be in the second house.

Now, we know the coffee drinker is somewhere between the fantasy book person and the science fiction fan.  The only spot left for the coffee drinker is the second house!

We know:

*  The person who likes red lives in the second house.
*  The person who likes red lives right next to the mystery book reader.
*  The mystery book reader can't be in the first house.

So, the mystery book reader must be in the third house, and the red lover is in the second.

We also know the fantasy book lover isn't in the first house.  That means the fantasy book lover must be in the first house!


The answer is **(C) 1**.

So the science fiction book fanatic lives in **house #4**.  

The answer is **(B)**. 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have two houses, and we know some stuff about the people who live there.  

* One person ate spaghetti, the other ate fried rice.
* One person plays the flute, the other plays the cello.
* One person wears loafers, the other wears sandals.
* One person likes white, the other likes green.
* One person has a sedan, the other has an SUV.

Here are the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the first house.
2. The person who has an SUV doesn't live in the second house.
3. The flutist lives right next to the person who likes white.
4. The person who wears loafers lives right next to the person who likes white.

Hmm... let's think.  Since the flutist and the white-lover are next to each other, and the loafers-wearer is also next to the white-lover, they must all be together in one house.  

And since the fried rice eater isn't in the first house, and the SUV owner isn't in the second house, we can figure out the rest!

**So, the person wearing sandals must live in house 2.** 


Let me know if you want to try another puzzle!
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the violinist lives.

Here's what we know:

* **Three houses:**  We've got houses numbered 1, 2, and 3.
* **Three people:** Each house has someone living in it.
* **Different stuff:** Each person has different flowers, fruit, cars, instruments, and drinks.

Here are the clues, and let's see if we can use them:

1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other.
2. The person with the sedan lives to the left of the person eating mangos.
3. The person who only drinks water doesn't live in the first house.
4. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. The sedan is right next to the person with daffodils.
6. The cellist lives right next to the saxophonist.
7. The person with carnations doesn't live in the third house.
8. The sedan is right next to the person eating apples.
9. The person eating apples lives right next to the violinist.

Hmm... this is a lot to keep track of!  Let me think...

* **Start with the easy ones:** We know the root beer lover is in house 3.

* **Think about the ""next to"" clues:**  These are really important! They help us connect things.

* **Look for patterns:**  Maybe we can find a clue that tells us about two things at once.


It might take a little time, but if we keep working through the clues, we can figure out where the violinist lives! 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.

We have to figure out which house the person wearing loafers lives in.  We know some stuff already:

* House 3 is yellow.
* House 2 has high heels.
* House 5 has grilled cheese.

We can use the other clues to figure out the rest.  It might take a while, but we can do it!

Let me think...  

*  Hmm, clue 7 says there's one house between spaghetti and loafers. That's helpful!

*  And clue 9 says loafers are to the right of the cat lover.

*  We also know the person wearing boots is to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

I'm gonna need to keep thinking and matching up clues. This is like a detective game! 


Let me know if you want to try working through some more clues together. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the person with the TV lives in house number 1.
* We also know the person with the lilies doesn't live in house number 1.

That means the person with the lilies must live in house number 2.  Since the only other thing left is the computer, the person with the computer must live in house number 2 too!


**Answer: (A) 2** 
"
"Okay, so we have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).  

Let's see what we know:

*  Someone in one house ate pizza, and someone else ate spaghetti.
*  One house has tulips, and the other has daffodils.
*  One person likes history books, and the other likes science fiction.
*  One person plays baseball, and the other plays golf.
*  One person plays the guitar, and the other plays percussion.

Here are the clues:

1. The science fiction fan lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The pizza eater and the history book fan live next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives to the right of the daffodils.

Hmm... let me think.  If the science fiction fan is to the left of the golfer, they can't be in house 2.  And if the pizza and history book fan are together, they could be in either house.

The guitarist being to the right of the daffodils means the guitarist can't be in house 1.

Putting it all together, here's what I think:

* House 1: Pizza, Tulips, History, Baseball, Percussion
* House 2: Spaghetti, Daffodils, Science Fiction, Golf, Guitar

So the percussionist lives in **house 1**. 




"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the percussionist lives.

First, we know the violinist lives in the fourth house.  And the bird keeper lives in the fifth house.  

We also know some things about where other people live based on what they have:

* The person with the gameboy lives to the right of the guitarist.
* The person with the television lives to the left of the person with the radio.
* The flutist lives right next to the person with the television.

Hmm, that gives us a few clues to work with.  Let me see if I can put it all together...


Let me think...  I'm not sure I have enough clues to figure out exactly where the percussionist lives.  Maybe if we had a few more hints, we could solve it! 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* House 1 has lilies.
* The basketball player isn't in House 1.
* The radio person is to the right of the apple eater AND the violinist.

So, since House 1 has lilies, the radio person must be in House 2.  That means the apple eater and the violinist are in House 1.


The violinist lives in **house 1**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The tennis player is in house 3.
* The grilled cheese eater is in house 5.
* The golfer is in house 4.

Now, let's look at the other clues:

* Someone ate fried rice and someone ate spaghetti, and there's one house between them.
* Stew is right next to spaghetti.

Hmm... that means spaghetti must be in house 3 and stew is in house 2.

* Pizza is to the left of the cricketer.
* Tennis (house 3) is to the left of the soccer player.

So, the only place left for the cricketer is house 1!


**Answer:** (C) 1 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We have two houses, and we need to find out which one has the person wearing loafers.  Here's what we know:

* **House 1:**  We don't know much about this house yet.
* **House 2:** We know the person in this house doesn't wear running shoes.

Let's look at the clues:

1. **Running shoes are not in the first house.**  This means they must be in house 2.
2. **The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.** This means the white-lover is in house 1 and the spaghetti eater is in house 2.
3. **The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.** Since the spaghetti eater is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1.
4. **The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.** This means the water-drinker is in house 1.

Since we know the baseball player is in house 1 and the spaghetti eater is in house 2, the person wearing loafers must be in **house 1**.




**So the answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The root beer lover doesn't live in house number 2.
* The person who likes oranges doesn't live in house number 2 either.

That means the root beer lover could be in house number 1 or house number 3.  We need more clues to know for sure! 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  The person in the first house ate spaghetti.
*  The person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house.
*  The person who ate fried rice isn't in the second house.
*  The person in boots lives right next to the person who ate fried rice.

So, the person wearing loafers has to be in the **second house**. 


**Answer:** (A) 2 
"
"This puzzle is tricky! It's like a giant Sudoku, but with people and stuff instead of numbers.  

Here's how I'd try to solve it:

1. **Make a Table:** I'd draw a table with the houses numbered 1 to 5, and then columns for the car, lunch, fruit, book, and device.

2. **Start with the Obvious:**  Look for clues that tell you exactly where someone lives. Like, we know the science fiction fan is in house number 3.

3. **Look for Clues that Connect Things:**  Clues like ""the person who ate pizza lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes"" are super helpful. They tell us those two people are next to each other.

4. **Keep Trying:**  It might take a while to figure out where everyone goes, but keep using the clues and trying to connect things.  

I'm not sure I can solve it all without writing it all out, but I bet if I keep working at it, I can find the mystery book reader's house! 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's break it down.  

We have five houses and we need to figure out where the person with lilies lives.  We know some stuff already:

* The dog owner is in house 3.
* The root beer lover is in house 5.

That helps! Now let's look at the other clues and see if we can connect them.  It's like a detective game!

* **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker and the rose bouquet are next to each other. Hmm, that means they are in houses that are right next door to each other.
* **Clue 6:** The person with running shoes and the bird keeper are also next to each other.

We need to keep thinking about how these clues fit together.  It might take a little time, but if we keep looking for connections, we'll figure out where the lilies are! 


Let me know if you want to try working through some more clues together! 
"
"Okay, so we know the mystery book person lives in house number 1.  And the tennis player doesn't live there.  

That means the fantasy book person must live in house number 2! 

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.  

We have to figure out which house the person who likes white lives in.  We know some stuff about each house:

* **Music:** One person plays guitar, violin, saxophone, and piano.
* **Shoes:** One person wears boots, sandals, running shoes, and loafers.
* **Lunch:** One person ate fried rice, pizza, stew, and spaghetti.
* **Flowers:** One person has roses, daffodils, lilies, and carnations.
* **Color:** One person likes white, yellow, green, and blue.

And we have some clues to help us connect these things:

1. Sandals are next to spaghetti.
2. Stew is before spaghetti.
3. No roses in the first house.
4. Running shoes are next to daffodils.
5. Pizza and daffodils are next to each other.
6. White is after running shoes.
7. Lilies are next to the guitar.
8. Daffodils aren't in the third house.
9. Green is two houses away from the piano.
10. Green is before the piano.
11. Blue is before pizza.
12. Lilies are after the violin.
13. Loafers are in the fourth house.

Let's start putting this together!  It might take a little time to figure out where everyone lives.  


"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We have to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.  

Here's what we know:

* The cellist lives in the first house.
* The golfer, violinist, and whoever wears high heels don't live in the fourth house.

We also know some things about where people live in relation to each other:

* The basketball player lives to the left of the person who likes red.
* The flutist lives to the right of the person wearing boots.
* The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
* The basketball player lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes.
* The person who likes yellow lives directly to the left of the person who likes milk.
* The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.
* The person who likes blue lives to the right of the root beer lover.
* The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the coffee drinker.

Hmm... this is a lot to keep track of!  We need to use these clues to figure out where everyone lives and then we can find the water drinker. 

It might help to draw a little chart to keep everything organized. 


Let me know if you want to try working through it together! 

"
"The answer is **(C) 1**.  

The clue says the person who likes red lives in the first house.  
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the lilies are. 

First, I'd write down the houses 1 through 5 and make some columns for the person, their pet, what they have, their shoes, the sport they play, and their flowers.

Then, I'd start filling in what I know for sure. Like, we know the swimmer lives in house 4, and the person with running shoes lives in house 1.  

Next, I'd look for clues that tell us things are next to each other. Like, the person with loafers lives right next to the person with carnations. That helps me figure out the order of some houses.

I'd keep going through the clues, trying to figure out where everyone lives and what they like. It might take a while, but eventually, I'll find the house with the lilies! 


Let me know if you want to give me some more clues, and I'll see if I can narrow it down! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The kiwi eater lives in house 1.
* The science fiction fan lives in house 2.
* The bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other.
* The tennis player and the apple eater live next to each other.
* The dog owner doesn't live in house 1.

Hmm...  If the kiwi eater is in house 1, and the tennis player and apple eater are together, then they must also be in house 1.  That means the bird keeper and high heels person are in house 2.

Since the dog owner isn't in house 1, they must be in house 2.

That leaves the cricketer as the only one who can live in house 1!


So the answer is **(A) 2**. 




"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

* **House 2:**  Someone eats oranges and swims here.
* **House 3:** The fish enthusiast lives here.
* **House 4:**  Someone ate grilled cheese here.
* **House 5:** Someone ate pizza here.

We also know some other things about the people:

* The grilled cheese eater and pizza eater live next to each other.
* The cat lover lives right before the fish enthusiast.
*  And so on...

We need to use all the clues to figure out who lives where and what they like to eat, play, and have as pets. It's like a big puzzle!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the grapes eater isn't in house 1.
* The baseball player is in house 2.
* The convertible driver is also in house 2.

That means the person eating mangos has to be in **house 1**! 


**Answer:** (B) 1 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
* The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who eats kiwis.
* The person who eats apples lives right next to the person who eats oranges.

So, here's what I think:

* Since the blue person is in house 2, the kiwi person must be in house 3.
* The apple and orange eaters have to be in houses 1 and 2.

The last clue tells us the white person lives to the right of the green person.  That means the white person must be in house 3!


The answer is **(A) 3**. 




"
"Okay, so we have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).  

Let's see what we know:

* Someone in one house likes mystery books, and someone else likes fantasy books.
* One person drinks root beer, and the other drinks coffee.
* One person plays soccer, and the other swims.
* One person has a phone, and the other has a gameboy.
* One house has tulips, and the other has roses.

Here are the clues:

1. The root beer drinker lives to the right of the person with the roses.
2. The soccer player lives right next to the mystery book reader.
3. The gameboy person lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

Hmm...  

Since the root beer drinker is to the right of the roses, the roses can't be in house 2.  

And because the soccer player is next to the mystery book reader, and the gameboy person is to the left of the mystery book reader, it has to be like this:

Gameboy - Soccer - Mystery

So the roses must be in **house 1 (A)**! 


"
"Okay, so we have these four houses and we need to figure out where the dog owner lives.  

Let's think about the clues:

*  The minivan is to the right of the fish person.
*  There are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
*  The truck is right next to the sedan.
*  The fish person lives right next to the dog owner.
*  The cat person doesn't live in the second house.

Hmm...  If we put the truck next to the sedan, and the fish person next to the dog owner, that means the dog owner has to be in **house 4**! 


**So the answer is (A).** 





"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The root beer lover is in house number 2.
* The person who likes yellow is in house number 3.

Clue 1 says the blue person is to the right of the yellow person.  Since yellow is in house 3, the blue person must be in house 4.


So the answer is **(B) 4**. 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the bird keeper lives.

*  The cricketer lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
*  The baseball player lives to the left of the cat lover.
*  The grape eater lives to the right of the basketball player.
*  The dog owner lives to the left of the green lover.
*  The sandal wearer lives to the right of the dog owner.
*  The loafer wearer lives to the right of the grape eater.

* **House 1:**  Someone with horses lives here.
* **House 4:**  Someone with a dog and a cricketer lives here.
* **House 5:**  The coffee drinker lives here.

We also know some other stuff about people's favorite things, but it's hard to connect them yet.

Let's look at the clues about the tennis player:

* **Clue 14:** The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  The tulips are in the third house.
*  The computer is in the second house.
*  The phone is next to the TV, and the phone is to the left of the TV. So the phone is in the first house and the TV is in the third house.
*  The lilies are to the right of the phone, so the lilies must be in the fourth house.
*  The roses are next to the carnations, and the roses are to the left of the carnations. Since the lilies are in the fourth house, the roses must be in the third house and the carnations in the fourth.
*  The daffodils aren't in the fourth house. That means the daffodils must be in the fifth house.



So the carnations are in **house 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the dog owner lives.

First, let's make a little table to keep track of everything:

| House | Person | Pet     | Sport   | Shoes   |

| 1     |        |         |         |         |
| 2     |        |         | Cricketer |         |
| 3     |        |         |         | Sandals |
| 4     | Golfer  |         |         |         |
| 5     |        |         |         |         |

* The golfer lives in house 4.
* The tennis player is to the left of the person wearing sandals (house 3).
* The person wearing running shoes isn't in house 5.
* The baseball player is to the right of the person wearing sandals (house 3).
* The cat lover is to the right of the golfer (house 4).

Let me know if you want to try figuring it out together! 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

*  House 1 is on the left, House 2 is on the right.
*  One person likes root beer, the other likes water.
*  One person eats bananas, the other eats grapes.
*  One person had pizza for lunch, the other had stew.
*  One person drives a truck, the other drives a minivan.
*  One person has a radio, the other has a computer.

And here are the clues:

1. The radio and the truck are next to each other.
2. The radio is to the left of the pizza.
3. The root beer lover doesn't live in House 1.
4. The grapes are to the left of the computer.

Let me see... if the radio and truck are together, and the radio is before the pizza, then the pizza must be in House 2!

*  The tea drinker lives in the first house.
*  The person who had pizza lives in the second house.
*  The milk drinker is to the left of the spaghetti eater.
*  The spaghetti eater is to the left of the person who only drinks water.
*  The coffee drinker is to the left of the person who likes yellow.
*  The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other.
*  The person who likes green doesn't live in the first house.
*  The person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the first house.

Hmm... let me see if I can put all these clues together.  

If we start with the first two clues, we know:

House 1: Tea
House 2: Pizza

Then, we know the milk, spaghetti, and water person have to go somewhere.  Since the spaghetti eater is to the left of the water drinker, it has to be like this:

House 3: Milk
House 4: Spaghetti
House 5: Water

Now, we know the coffee drinker is to the left of the yellow person.  And the white and water person live together.  That means the only place left for the green person is house 4!



**Answer: (C) 4** 




"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd write down the houses and make a little table to keep track of who lives where:

| House | Person | Pet   | Shoes | Drink | Color | Car    |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1     |        |       |       |       |       |        |

| 4     |        |       |       |       |       |        |

* **Clue 8:** The horse owner lives in house 4. 
* **Clue 12:** The person who likes white lives in house 3.

| 4     | Horse  |       |       |       |       |        |

We can keep going with the other clues! It might take a little time, but we can figure out where everyone lives. 



"
"Wow, this is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd make a table to keep track of everything:

| House | Drink | Fruit | Shoes | Sport | Flowers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |   |   |   |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |   |
| 4 |   |   |   |   |   |
| 5 |   |   |   |   |   |

Now, let's use the clues:

* **Clue 4:** The person wearing running shoes lives in house 3. Let's write that down!

| House | Drink | Fruit | Shoes | Sport | Flowers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |   |   |   |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   | Running Shoes |   |   |
| 4 |   |   |   |   |   |
| 5 |   |   |   |   |   |

* **Clue 11:** The baseball player lives in house 4.

| House | Drink | Fruit | Shoes | Sport | Flowers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |   |   |   |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   | Running Shoes |   |   |
| 4 |   |   |   | Baseball |   |
| 5 |   |   |   |   |   |

We can keep going like this, filling in the table with all the clues. It might take a while, but eventually, we'll figure out where everyone lives! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The soccer player is in house number 3.
* The person with tulips isn't in house 3.
* The golfer lives right next to the basketball player.
* Grilled cheese is eaten before spaghetti.

So, the golfer and basketball player must be in houses 1 and 2.  Since grilled cheese comes before spaghetti, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1. 


The answer is **(A) 1**. 
"
"The answer is **(D) 3**. 

Here's what I figured out:

*  We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
*  The pianist lives in the third house.
*  And the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house! 


"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!

Here's what I know:

* **House 3:**  The tea drinker lives here.
* **Stew and Spaghetti:** Stew is to the left of spaghetti.
* **Running Shoes and Stew:** Running shoes are to the left of stew.
* **Grilled Cheese:** Grilled cheese isn't in the first house.
* **Water and Grilled Cheese:** Water is to the right of grilled cheese.
* **High Heels and Water:** High heels and water are next to each other.
* **Root Beer and Sandals:** Root beer is to the right of sandals.

Let me see... if we put it all together, it looks like this:

1.  Sandals, Grilled Cheese, Water
2.  Running Shoes,  
3.  Tea
4.  High Heels, Stew, Root Beer

So the person wearing running shoes lives in **House 2**. 

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

We know:

*  Someone has a radio in house #3.
*  The basketball player is in house #4.

That means the computer can't be in houses #3 or #4.

We also know:

* The soccer player and the computer are next to each other.

So, the computer must be in either house #1 or #2.

Let's keep thinking about the other clues to see if we can narrow it down more! 



"
"The science fiction fan lives in house 1! 

Here's how I know:

* The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction fan. 
* Since there are only two houses, the science fiction fan has to be in house 1. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the pianist lives in the first house.
* The root beer lover is to the right of the horse owner.  So the horse owner can't be in the second house.
* The person who likes white doesn't live in the second house.

Putting it all together, the horse owner must be in the first house, and the root beer lover is in the second house.  That means the dog owner must live in the second house!


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know:

* Someone ate stew in house number 2.
* Someone ate pizza in house number 4.

And here are some other clues:

* The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction fan.
* The history buff lives to the right of the percussionist.
* The guitarist lives before the violinist.
* The violinist doesn't live in house number 4.
* There are two houses between the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book fan.

Hmm... this is tricky!  Let me see if I can use these clues to figure out where the percussionist lives.  


Let me think...  I'll try drawing a little diagram to help me keep track of everything. 



(At this point, the middle school student would likely start drawing a diagram of the four houses, labeling them 1-4. They would then try to place the information from the clues onto the diagram, using arrows or other symbols to show relationships between the clues.)



Based on the diagram and the clues, I think the percussionist lives in **house number 3**. 




Let me know if you want to check if that's right! 

"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!

Here's what we know:

* **House 1:**  Someone who likes white lives here.
* **House 2:**  Someone who likes daffodils lives here.
* **House 3:**  We don't know anything for sure about this house yet.

We also know some other stuff about the people:

* Someone has boots, someone has running shoes, and someone has sandals.
* Someone has a bird, someone has horses, and someone has a dog.
* Someone likes green, someone likes white, and someone likes yellow.

Let's think about the clues:

*  The person who likes white and the person who has daffodils live next to each other. That means they are in Houses 1 and 2.
* The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who wears running shoes.  

Putting it all together, the horse owner must live in **House 1**. 





"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  Someone eats apples in house #3.
*  The mango eater is right next to the apple eater, so they must be in house #2.
*  The coffee drinker isn't in house #2.
*  The coffee drinker lives right next to the milk drinker.

Since the coffee drinker can't be in house #2, they must be in house #1.  And since the coffee drinker is next to the milk drinker, the milk drinker must be in house #3.




So the answer is **(C) 3**. 
"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

It's like a detective game! We have to use the clues to figure out who lives where.

* **Clue 1:** The science fiction fan lives in house number 2.  
* **Clue 4:** The person with carnations lives in house number 1.

Let's write that down:

| House | Person | Shoes | Flower | Color | Book |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  | Carnations |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  | Science Fiction |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |

Now we need to use the other clues to figure out the rest!  It might take a little time, but we can do it! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The person who drinks water lives in the first house.
* The person with lilies lives in the second house.

Since the milk drinker is one house away from the water drinker, they must live in the third house.  That leaves the rose bouquet for the first house!


So the answer is **(C) 1**. 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd write down the houses and make some columns for shoes, color, device, and sport.  

Then I'd fill in what we know for sure:

* House 1: Loafers
* House 3: Yellow, Tennis

Now we need to use the other clues to figure out the rest.  It's like a detective game!

Hmm... let me see...  

*  The cricketer is next to the sandals...
*  The blue person is to the right of the green person...

I'd keep going like that, trying to match up the clues and see where they fit. It might take a little time, but we can solve it! 


Let me know if you want to work through it together, clue by clue! 
"
"The answer is (A) 1.  

Clue 4 says the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, so that's where they are! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what I think:

*  We know someone has a computer, a radio, and a TV.  
*  And they each have different flowers: carnations, roses, and tulips.
*  Plus, they each play a different sport: golf, soccer, and tennis.

Let's see...

*  The tennis player is to the left of the TV. That means the TV can't be in the last house.
*  The golfer doesn't live in the middle house.
*  The computer and tulips are next to each other.
*  The radio is to the right of the roses.
*  The radio is also to the right of the TV.

Hmm...  If we put the TV in the first house, the radio has to be in the last house. That means the computer and tulips are in the second house!

**So the answer is (B) 2** 


"
"Okay, so we have these five houses and we need to figure out where the person wearing sandals lives.  

Let's use the clues to figure it out:

* **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives in the third house.
* **Clue 2:** The person with carnations lives to the right of the guitarist.
* **Clue 3:** The person with sandals lives directly left of the person with tulips.
* **Clue 4:** The person with running shoes lives directly left of the person with daffodils.
* **Clue 5:** The violinist lives in the second house.
* **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
* **Clue 7:** The person with lilies lives to the right of the person with high heels.
* **Clue 8:** The person with loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
* **Clue 9:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 10:** The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 11:** The person with daffodils lives in the fifth house.
* **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person with sandals lives and where the cellist lives.

Hmm, this is a lot to keep track of! Let's see...

* We know the violinist is in house 2.
* The swimmer is in house 3.
* The cricketer is in house 4.
* The daffodils are in house 5.

That means the sandals must be in house 1. 



**So the answer is (E) 1** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2. 
*  The person in high heels lives right next to the fish person.

Since the grilled cheese person is in house 2, the high heels person must be in house 1, and the fish person is next to them.

So, the stew person must be in **house 2**.


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the cat lover lives.

Here's what we know:

* **House 5:**  We know someone who loves romance books lives here.
* **House 3:**  The fish enthusiast lives here.
* **House 2:**  Someone who owns horses lives here.

Now, we need to use the other clues to figure out the rest. It's like a big game of detective!  We need to look for clues that tell us who lives near each other.  

Let me think...  

(After carefully reading through all the clues and making some notes)

Hmm, it's tough! I'm not sure I can figure out exactly where the cat lover lives with just these clues.  


"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

We know:

* Someone has a phone, a radio, a computer, and a gameboy.
* Someone plays the flute, guitar, saxophone, and drums.
* Someone eats mangos, grapes, kiwis, and oranges.
* Someone wears boots, running shoes, loafers, and high heels.
* Someone likes fantasy, science fiction, history, and romance books.

And here are some clues to help us:

1. The grape and orange eater live next to each other.
2. The phone is in the third house.
3. The sax player lives to the left of the boot wearer.
4. The flute player is in the third house.
5. The orange eater lives to the right of the boot wearer.
6. The running shoes are in the third house.
7. The romance book lover lives right next to the science fiction fan.
8. The loafer wearer doesn't live in the first house.
9. The gameboy owner lives to the right of the flute player.
10. There are two houses between the high heel wearer and the fantasy book lover.
11. The history book lover lives to the left of the orange eater.
12. The radio isn't in the second house.
13. The kiwi eater doesn't live in the first house.
14. The drummer lives in the fourth house.
15. The science fiction fan and the running shoe wearer live next to each other.

Hmm... this is a lot to keep track of!  Let me see if I can use these clues to figure out where the orange eater lives... 


(Continues to work through the clues, using the information provided to deduce the location of the orange eater) 



Let me know if you want me to keep going! 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

It seems like we need to use all the clues to figure out where everyone lives.  It's like a detective game!

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. Hmm, that means they could be in houses 1 & 2, or 2 & 3, or 3 & 4.
* **Clue 2:** The pizza person lives right before the tea person.  
* **Clue 3:** There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese person.

We need to keep going and see if we can connect more clues!  It might help to draw a little table to keep track of everything. 


Let me know if you want to try working through it together! 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd write down the houses and make some columns for shoes, lunch, books, and cars.  

Then I'd start filling in what I know for sure:

* **House 1:**  We know the convertible is in the first house.

From there, I'd use the other clues to see what else I can figure out.  It's like a detective game!  

* **Clue 2** says the truck is next to the mystery book reader.
* **Clue 3** says running shoes are next to high heels.

I'd keep going like that, trying to connect the clues and see where they lead me.  It might take a while, but eventually, I'd find out who had pizza! 


Let me know if you want to work through it together! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the mystery book reader is in house number 4, and the saxophonist is also in house 4.  

The saxophonist and the violinist are neighbors, so the violinist must be in house number 3.


The answer is **(C) 3**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  The TV is in house 4.
*  The person with loafers is in house 2.

That means the phone can't be in house 2.  

Also, the person with boots has to be in house 1 because they live to the left of the person with loafers.

Now, the radio and sandals have to be in houses 3 and 4, but there are two houses between them.  

So, the gameboy has to be in **house 1**.


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"The answer is (B) 2. 

The clue says the person in the second house wears high heels.  
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the person in loafers doesn't live in house 1. 
* And the mystery book reader isn't in house 2.

So, the person in loafers must live in house 2!


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

We know there are four houses and each person has different things: flowers, a device, shoes, and lunch.  We also have clues to help us figure out who lives where.

Here's what I'm thinking:

* **Clue 1:**  The person with running shoes and the gameboy are next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** The pizza person is right next to the person wearing sandals.
* **Clue 3:** The running shoes person isn't in the middle house.
* **Clue 4:** The tulips person is right next to the pizza person.
* **Clue 5:** The carnations person is to the left of the sandals person.
* **Clue 6:** The running shoes person is right next to the stew person.
* **Clue 7:** The TV person is right next to the radio person.
* **Clue 8:** The running shoes person and the rose bouquet person are next to each other.
* **Clue 9:** The boots person is to the left of the pizza person.
* **Clue 10:** The spaghetti person is right next to the radio person.

Hmm... this is a lot to keep track of!  I need to start drawing a little chart or something to see if I can figure out where everyone lives. 

Let me know if you want to try working through it together! 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the person with mangos lives in house #1.
* The person with roses is to the left of the person with lilies, and since the mangos are in house #1, the roses must be there too.
* The sax player doesn't live in house #1, so they must live in house #2.

That means the person eating apples has to live in house #2!


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"The coffee drinker lives in house number 4!  It says so right in clue number 5.  


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **House 1, 2, and 3:**  There are three houses, and someone lives in each one.
* **Flowers:** One person has tulips, one has roses, and one has lilies.
* **Cars:** One person has a sedan, one has an SUV, and one has a truck.

Let's use clues to figure out who lives where:

1. **Tulips aren't in house 3.**
2. **The SUV is right next to the lilies.**
3. **The sedan and roses are next to each other.**
4. **Roses aren't in house 2.**

Thinking it through...

* Since the roses can't be in house 2, they must be in house 1 with the sedan.
* The SUV and lilies have to be in houses 1 and 2 because they're next to each other.
* That means tulips must be in house 3.

So, the truck has to be in house 3!


**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the milk lover lives.

Here's what we know:

* **House 5:**  Has tulips.
* **House 4:** Has lilies.
* **Rose and Milk:** They live next to each other.
* **Pianist and Mystery Book Reader:** They live next to each other too.
* **Carnations:**  Is right before the Pianist.

Hmm... that's a good start!  We need to keep thinking about how these clues fit together.  

Let me know if you want to try figuring it out together!  



"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's break it down.  

We have four houses and we need to figure out where the basketball player lives.  We know some stuff about each house already:

* **House 1:**  Someone who likes yellow lives here, and they're also eating kiwis.
* **House 4:**  The person who drives a convertible lives here.

Now, let's look at the clues:

* **Clue 10:** The person with an SUV and the person eating a banana live next to each other.
* **Clue 11:** The person driving a minivan lives right before the person who likes white.
* **Clue 12:** The person with an SUV and the person who likes blue live next to each other.

We can use these clues to start figuring out where things go.  It's like a game of connect the dots!

Keep working through the clues, and you'll be able to figure out where the basketball player lives.  It might take a little time, but you can do it! 


Let me know if you want to try working through some more clues together. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* Someone who likes green lives in the third house.
* The person who likes yellow and green live next to each other.
* The fantasy book fan lives to the right of the stew eater.
* The grilled cheese person doesn't live in the second house.
* Stew is right next to the romance book lover.

Hmm...  Let's see. If green is in the third house, yellow has to be in the second house.  

Since stew is next to the romance book lover, and we know green is in the third house, stew must be in the first house.

That means the blue person has to be in the first house!


**Answer: (C) 1** 
"
"Okay, so we have this puzzle with three houses and lots of clues about the people who live there.  Let's see if we can figure out where the bird keeper lives!

Here's what we know:

* **House 1:**  Someone has carnations here.
* **House 3:** Someone likes yellow here.
* **Clue 1:** The tulips and the bird keeper are neighbors.
* **Clue 4:**  The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

Hmm...  Let me think.  We need to figure out where the bird keeper is.  

(Thinking for a moment)

I think the bird keeper must live in **House 2**.  


Let me know if you want to try figuring out anything else! 





"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the fantasy book person lives in the first house.
* And the cellist is also in the first house.
*  The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since the first house is on the left, the green person must be in house 1.

So, the mystery book reader has to be in house 2!


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"This puzzle is tricky! It's like a giant game of detective.  We need to figure out who lives in each house and what they like.

Here's what I'd do:

1. **Make a Table:** I'd draw a table with columns for House Number (1 to 5), Person's Name, Lunch, Book, Shoes, Sport, and Fruit.

2. **Start with the Clues:** I'd look at the clues carefully and see if any tell me exactly where someone lives or what they like. For example, if a clue says ""The baseball player lives next to the grilled cheese eater,"" I'd write that down in my table.

3. **Think About the Clues Together:** Sometimes clues can help us figure out more than one thing at a time.  If I know the mangos are next to the oranges, and I also know the apples are somewhere to the left of the fried rice, I might be able to figure out where those are!

4. **Keep Going:** I'd keep looking for clues and trying to connect them. It might take a while, but eventually, I'd fill in the whole table!


I'm not sure I can solve it all without writing it down, but that's how I'd start! 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The golfer lives in house number 2.
* The history book buff lives in house number 1.

The clue says the swimmer lives one house away from the science fiction fan.  Since the golfer is in the middle, the swimmer must be in house number 1 and the science fiction fan must be in house number 3.


So the answer is **(A) 1**. 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

We have to figure out where the person who ate stew lives.  We know some stuff about each house:

* **House 1:**  
* **House 2:**
* **House 3:**
* **House 4:**

We also know:

* Someone is a baseball player, a golfer, a soccer player, and a swimmer.
* Someone ate spaghetti, stew, fried rice, and pizza.
* Someone is eating oranges, apples, a banana, and grapes.
* Someone has a fish, a cat, horses, or a bird.
* Someone likes fantasy books, science fiction, history, or romance.

We have some clues to help us figure out who lives where:

1. The swimmer lives right next to the person who eats apples.
2. The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer.
3. The fantasy book lover lives right next to the person who owns horses.
4. The person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the last house.
5. The cat lover lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff.
7. The person who eats a banana lives right next to the soccer player.
8. The bird keeper lives in the third house.
9. The science fiction book lover lives right next to the person who ate pizza.
10. The person who eats grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book lover.
11. The person who ate pizza lives to the left of the baseball player.

* One person ate fried rice, and the other ate spaghetti.
* One person has a cat, and the other has horses.
* One person likes history books, and the other likes romance books.
* One person wears sandals, and the other wears running shoes.

Here's what we can figure out from the clues:

* **Clue 1:** The person in sandals lives next to the person with horses. So, House 1 is sandals and House 2 is horses.

* **Clue 2:** The history book person lives to the right of the spaghetti eater.  

Putting it all together, the person who ate fried rice must live in **House 2**. 


**Answer: (B)** 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person has lilies, the other has daffodils.
* One person plays the flute, the other plays the saxophone.
* One person drives a convertible, the other drives a sedan.

And here are the clues:

* The sedan is to the left of the lilies.
* The flutist doesn't live in the first house.

Hmm... so if the sedan is to the left of the lilies, that means the sedan must be in house 1.  

Since the flutist isn't in house 1, they must be in house 2.

That means the person with the lilies must live in house 2!


**So the answer is (B).** 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  This is like a puzzle!

Here's what we know:

* **Houses:** There are four houses, numbered 1 to 4.
* **People:** Each house has one person.
* **Sports:** Each person plays a different sport: cricket, swimming, golf, or tennis.
* **Flowers:** Each person has a different flower: roses, carnations, lilies, or daffodils.
* **Books:** Each person likes a different kind of book: history, romance, mystery, or fantasy.

Here are the clues, and let's see if we can use them to find out where the romance book lover lives:

1.  One house is between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.
2.  The tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader.
3.  Carnations are in the fourth house.
4.  The fantasy book enthusiast lives right next to the swimmer.
5.  The golfer lives to the right of the daffodils.
6.  Roses are in the third house.
7.  The tennis player doesn't live in the fourth house.
8.  One house is between the daffodils and the roses.
9.  Two houses are between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.

Hmm... this is tricky! Let me think... 


Let me know if you want to try working through it together! 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the tulips are.

First, we know a few things for sure:

* Someone who likes coffee lives in house number 3.
* The milk drinker lives in house number 5.
* The TV isn't in house number 5.

Now, we need to use the other clues to figure out where the tulips are.  It's like a detective game!  We have to look for clues that tell us who lives near each other.  

Hmm... let me see...  

(After carefully reading through all the clues and making some notes)

I think the tulips are in **house number 2**. 


"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd write down the houses and make some columns for what each person has: shoes, lunch, car, sport, and flowers.

Then, I'd use the clues to fill in what I know for sure.  Like, we know the minivan is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 1.

After that, I'd look for clues that tell us things are next to each other, like the boots and the minivan. That helps narrow things down!

I'd keep going, using each clue to see what I can figure out. It might take a while, but eventually, I'd find the house number where the person with the rose bouquet lives. 


Let me know if you want to go through the clues together!

"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

First, I'd write down the houses 1 through 5 and make some columns for drinks, instruments, lunch, and colors.  

Then I'd start using the clues.  For example, we know the saxophonist is in house number 3.  That helps!

We also know the coffee drinker is to the left of the percussionist, and the coffee drinker is to the right of the person who likes red.  That means we can start putting some things together.

It's like a big game of connect the dots! We just have to keep using the clues and see what fits.  

It might take a while, but I bet we can find the percussionist's house! 


Let me know if you want to work through the clues together.  

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know a few things for sure:

*  Someone ate fried rice in house number 3.
*  Stew wasn't in houses 2 or 4.
*  The person who likes blue lives before the person who ate spaghetti.
*  Grilled cheese is after the person who likes white.

Hmm...  It's tricky!  We need to use all the clues to figure out where the white person lives.  

Let me think...  


(After some thought)

I'm not totally sure, but I think the person who likes white lives in **(C) 4**. 


Let me know if that's right! 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  The person who likes red lives in the third house.
*  The percussionist lives in the second house.

So, the first and third houses are taken.  

We also know the basketball player is to the right of the tennis player, and the violinist is in the third house. That means the basketball player must be in the first house!


**Answer:** (A) 1 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, we need to make a chart to keep track of everything.  We can write down the house numbers and then make columns for each of the things they have: flowers, instruments, drinks, and devices.

Then we can start filling in the chart using the clues.  For example, we know the computer is next to the root beer lover.  We can write that down in our chart.

We can keep doing this, using each clue to figure out where things go.  It might take a while, but if we're careful, we can solve it!

I'm not sure which house the carnations are in yet, but I'm going to keep working on it.



"
"Wow, this is a tricky puzzle!  It's like a big detective case.  

Here's how I'd try to solve it:

1. **Make a Chart:** I'd draw a table with the house numbers (1 to 5) and then columns for each thing: flowers, music, cars, books, and pets.

2. **Write Down What We Know:**  I'd start by writing down any clues that tell us exactly where something is.  For example, if a clue says ""The saxophonist lives in house number 3,"" I'd write that down right away.

3. **Look for Clues That Tell Us About Neighbors:**  Clues like ""The person who owns horses lives next to the daffodils"" help us figure out who lives near each other. I'd use that to fill in more of my chart.

4. **Keep Guessing and Checking:** Sometimes we have to make guesses and see if they fit with the other clues. If a guess doesn't work, we can try something else!

It might take a while, but with careful thinking and a good chart, I bet we can figure out where the minivan lives! 


Let me know if you want to try working through some of the clues together! 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.

It's like a big detective case, where we have to use clues to find out who lives where.  

Here's what we know:

* **House 2:** We know the dog owner lives here!
* **House 3:** The fish enthusiast lives here.

Now, we need to use the other clues to figure out the rest.  It might take a while, but if we keep looking for connections between the clues, we can solve it!

I'm not sure which house the person with the vase of tulips lives in yet, but I'm gonna keep working on it! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We have three houses and we need to figure out where the dog owner lives.  Here's what we know:

* **House 1:** The basketball player and the saxophonist live here.
* **House 2:** The tea drinker lives here, and the person who ate pizza lives to their left.
* **House 3:** The cricketer lives here.

We also know the dog owner is somewhere in the mix, but we don't know which house yet.  

Let me think...  Hmm, the only house left is house 2! 


**So the answer is (A) 2** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The history book person lives in the first house.
* The cat lover doesn't live in the second house.
* The person in high heels lives to the left of the daffodil person.

So, the history book person must be in House 1.  That means the cat lover is in House 2.  

Since the high heels person is to the left of the daffodils, and the only other house is House 1, the person in House 1 wears high heels and has the lilies.


The answer is **(A) 1**. 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.  

We have to figure out where the person who ate pizza lives.  We know some stuff already:

* Someone in house 1 has carnations.
* Someone in house 3 has apples.

We can use the other clues to figure out where everyone else lives. It's like a big game of detective!

Let me think...  

(After some time spent carefully reading the clues and making notes)

Hmm, this is tough! I'm not sure I can figure it out without a little more help.  



"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the cellist lives.

First, I'd write down the houses 1 through 4 and make some columns for color, instrument, flower, lunch, and book.  

Then, we know from the clues:

* The history book buff lives in house 2.
* The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 4.

Now we can start using the other clues to figure out where everyone else lives. It's like a big game of detective!  We need to look for clues that tell us who is near each other.  

For example, one clue says the person with the rose bouquet lives right next to the person who likes yellow.  We can write that down next to the clues.

Keep going through the clues one by one, and see if you can figure out where everyone lives.  It might take a while, but if you keep working at it, you'll find the answer! 


Let me know if you get stuck on a clue, and I'll see if I can help! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  Someone is a violinist, someone is a flutist, and someone is a pianist.
*  Someone eats kiwis, someone eats grapes, and someone eats oranges.

Here's what the clues tell us:

1. The pianist and the kiwi eater live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There's one house between the grape eater and the kiwi eater.
4. There's one house between the violinist and the kiwi eater.

Hmm...  If the pianist and kiwi eater are next to each other, and there's a house between the violinist and kiwi eater, it has to be like this:

Violinist - Grapes - Kiwi - Pianist

So the pianist lives in **house number 3 (A)**! 



"
"Okay, so we know the kiwi eater lives in house number 1.  And we know the fantasy book fan doesn't live in house number 1.  

That means the fantasy book fan has to live in house number 2!


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  Someone in the first house likes yellow.
*  The person with the grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
*  The person who likes red lives in the third house.
*  The person with the radio lives in the third house.

Putting those together, it looks like this:

House 1: Yellow,  
House 2:  
House 3: Red, Radio
House 4: Grilled Cheese

So the answer is **(D) 3**. 


"
"Okay, so we know the pianist is in one house and the cellist is in the other.  And the pianist is to the left of the cellist. That means the pianist is in house 1 and the cellist is in house 2.

The root beer lover doesn't live in house 2, so they must live in house 1. 


The answer is **(A) 1**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  There are 5 houses, numbered 1 to 5.
*  Each house has someone with different shoes and flowers.

Here's what we can figure out from the clues:

* **Clue 7:** The person with carnations lives in house 5.
* **Clue 2:** Tulips are to the left of loafers.
* **Clue 1:** Boots and carnations are next to each other, so boots are in house 4.
* **Clue 6:** Tulips aren't in house 4.
* **Clue 8:** Daffodils and running shoes are next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** Tulips are to the right of daffodils.

Putting it all together:

* House 1: ?
* House 2: ?
* House 3: Tulips
* House 4: Boots
* House 5: Carnations

The only flower left is lilies, and the only shoe left is high heels.  Since tulips are to the left of loafers, and daffodils and running shoes are together, lilies must be in house 2.




**Answer: (D)** 




"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.

It's like a big detective case, where we have to use clues to find out who lives where.  

Here's what I'd do:

1. **Make a table:** I'd draw a table with the house numbers (1 to 4) and then columns for each thing they like: color, instrument, sport, fruit, and drink.

2. **Fill in what we know:**  We can start with the clues that tell us exactly where something is.  For example, if a clue says ""The baseball player doesn't live in the second house,"" we can write that down.

3. **Look for connections:**  Clues like ""Two houses between..."" or ""Lives to the left of..."" help us figure out relationships.  We can use those to fill in more of the table.

4. **Keep guessing and checking:** Sometimes we have to make guesses and see if they fit with the other clues. If a guess doesn't work, we can try something else!

It might take a while, but with all the clues, we can definitely figure out where the pianist lives! 


Let me know if you want to try working through some of the clues together! 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses and three people, and each person has different things they like and wear.  

*  Someone ate spaghetti, someone ate fried rice, and someone ate stew.
*  One person likes white, one likes green, and one likes red.
*  One person wears boots, one wears running shoes, and one wears high heels.

Here's what we know for sure:

* The person who likes white lives in the first house.
* The person who likes green lives in the second house.
* The person who wears high heels doesn't live in the third house.

Let's think about the rest of the clues:

* The person wearing boots lives right next to the person wearing high heels.
* The person wearing boots lives to the left of the person who ate stew.
* The person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the second house.
* The person who ate stew doesn't live in the second house.

Putting it all together, I think the person who ate fried rice lives in **house 2**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  Someone has roses in house 2.
*  The science fiction fan lives next to the person with the roses, so they must be in house 1.
*  The fantasy book fan is to the left of the science fiction fan, so they are in house 4.
*  The romance book lover is right next to the tulips, and the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations.  

Putting it all together, here's what we have:

* House 1: Science Fiction, Carnations
* House 2: Roses
* House 3: Romance, Tulips
* House 4: Fantasy, Lilies 



So the answer is **(C) 4**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The science fiction fan lives in house 1.
* The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.

Since the science fiction fan is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 2.  That means the romance book lover has to be in **house 1**.


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so we know one person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.  And one person has a radio and the other has a phone.

The tricky part is that the percussionist lives right next to the person with the radio.  

That means the order has to be: percussionist - radio

Since everyone has to have a different instrument and a different device, the person with the phone must be the pianist!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the person with the convertible lives in house number 2.  

Then we have these clues:

*  There's one house between the person who likes white and the person with the sedan.
*  The person who likes yellow lives right next to the person with the sedan.

So, the yellow person must be in house 1 and the sedan person must be in house 3.  


The answer is **(A) 1**. 





"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd write down the houses and make some columns for shoes, cars, and pets.  

Then I'd fill in what we already know:

| House | Shoes     | Car      | Pet      |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1     | Running   |           |           |
| 2     |           |           |           |
| 3     |           | Sedan     |           |
| 4     |           |           |           |
| 5     |           |           |           |

Now we need to use the other clues.  It says the person with sandals lives to the left of the bird keeper, and there are two houses between the person with running shoes and the bird keeper. That means the bird keeper can't be in house 1 or 2.

We also know the high heels aren't in house 4, and the person with high heels lives right before the truck.  

Hmm, this is getting confusing!  We need to keep looking for clues that connect things together. 


Let me know if you want to try working through it together!  It might take a while to figure out where the horse owner lives. 

"
"Okay, so we have this puzzle with five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  It's like a detective game!

Here's what we know for sure:

* **House 1:**  Someone drives a convertible and is a bird keeper.
* **House 2:** Someone wears loafers.

We need to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.  

Let's try to use the other clues to figure out who lives in each house. It might take a while, but we can do it!  We just need to be careful and think about what each clue means. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  Someone ate fried rice, spaghetti, and grilled cheese.
*  One person likes science fiction, one likes fantasy, and one likes mysteries.

Here's what we can tell:

*  The spaghetti eater is to the left of the fried rice eater.
*  Fried rice is in the second house.
*  The fantasy book fan is also in the second house.

So, the second house has both fried rice and fantasy books!  That means the grilled cheese eater must be in the third house.


The answer is **(C) 3**. 
"
"Okay, so we know one house has tulips and the other has carnations.  

And we know the person with carnations lives to the left of the dog owner.  

That means the carnations must be in House 1! 


**Answer:** (B) 1 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the kiwi eater lives in house 2.  

*  The clue says the water drinker is to the left of the person wearing high heels.
*  And the person wearing sandals is to the left of the person who likes yellow.

Since house 2 is already taken, the high heel wearer must live in **house 2**.


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person has high heels and the other has sandals.
* High heels are to the left of sandals.
* Grapes and sandals are next to each other.
* Tea is to the left of the TV.

Since high heels are to the left of sandals, and grapes and sandals are together,  the high heels must be in house 1 and the sandals in house 2.

That means the person eating grapes is in house 1 and the person eating kiwis must be in house 2!


**Answer: (A) 2** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The tea drinker lives in the first house.
* The water drinker lives to the right of the cellist.
* There's one house between the violinist and the guitarist.
* The violinist doesn't live in the third house.

Hmm...  Since the tea drinker is in the first house, the violinist and guitarist can't be there.  And the violinist can't be in the third house either.  That means the violinist must live in the second house.  

If the violinist is in the second house, the guitarist has to be in the third house!


So the answer is **(C) 3**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a few things for sure:

* The person with sandals lives in house number 3.
* The tea drinker lives in house number 5.
* The milk drinker lives in house number 3.

The clue says the person with sandals lives right next to the person who only drinks water.  Since the sandals are in house 3, the water drinker must be in house 4.


So the answer is **(B) 4**. 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

Here's what we know:

* **Five houses:**  Numbered 1 to 5.
* **Five people:** Each with a different thing (phone, gameboy, computer, radio, TV) and a different lunch (spaghetti, pizza, stew, grilled cheese, fried rice).

Here are the clues, and let's try to use them:

1. **Gameboy and computer are next to each other.**  Hmm, that means they could be in houses 1 & 2, or 2 & 3.
2. **TV is to the left of the phone.**  
3. **One house between grilled cheese and radio.**
4. **One house between gameboy and fried rice.**
5. **Grilled cheese is right before spaghetti.**
6. **Radio is NOT in house 4.**
7. **Pizza is in house 4.**
8. **Computer is NOT in house 4.**

Let me think...  Since pizza is in house 4, and the computer isn't there, maybe the computer is in house 3?  And if the gameboy and computer are together, then the gameboy must be in house 2.

Now we have:

* House 1: ?
* House 2: Gameboy
* House 3: Computer
* House 4: Pizza
* House 5: ?

We need to figure out the rest!  


Let me know if you want to keep working on it together! 




"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.

| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |

* The bird keeper lives in house 2.
* The tennis player lives in house 1.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person plays percussion, the other plays guitar.
* One person ate pizza, the other ate grilled cheese.
* One person has a dog, the other has a bird.

And here are the clues:

* The grilled cheese eater lives to the right of the bird keeper.
* The percussionist doesn't live in house number 2.

Hmm...  Since the percussionist isn't in house 2, they must be in house 1.  

And because the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2.

So the person who had pizza must live in **house 1 (B)**! 


"
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3!  

It says so right in clue number 2.

*  The cat lover lives in the first house.
*  The second house doesn't have the loafers, the percussionist, the fantasy book person, or the history book person.

That means we have to figure out who lives in the other houses and what they like.  We can use the rest of the clues to help us.

It's like a detective game! We need to use all the clues to find the missing pieces.  


Let me think...  I need to write down all the clues and see if I can connect them.  It might take a little time, but I'm sure we can solve it! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know someone's eating grapes in the second house.  That's a good start!

Then there's this clue about red and green being next to each other.  Hmm, maybe they're in houses 3 and 4?  

And we know red has to be to the right of the kiwis.  

Let's see...  

(Thinking out loud, trying different combinations)

I think the person eating kiwis is in house **1**.  



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).  Let's figure out where the stew eater lives!

Here's what we know:

*  Someone in one house ate stew, and someone in the other house ate fried rice.
* One person has horses, and the other has a cat.
* One person is eating oranges, and the other is eating apples.
* One person likes mystery books, and the other likes science fiction.
* One person wears running shoes, and the other wears sandals.

And here are the clues:

1. The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
2. The mystery book reader lives right next to the cat lover.
3. The mystery book reader and the stew eater live right next to each other.

Hmm... let me think.  If the mystery book reader and stew eater are next to each other, and the mystery book reader is next to the cat lover, then the stew eater must be in house 2! 

**So the answer is (A).**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The root beer person is in the first house.
* The water person is in the second house.

"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!

Here's what we know:

* **House 1:**  The person here wears loafers.
* **Clue 3:** The grape eater is right next to the water drinker.
* **Clue 5:** The kiwi eater is right next to the milk drinker.

Let's try to put those together:

* **House 1:** Loafers, ?, ?
* **House 2:** ?, Grapes, Water, ?
* **House 3:** ?, Kiwis, Milk, ?

Hmm, we also know the phone person is to the left of the mango person, and the boot person is to the right of the gameboy person.  That means the phone and gameboy can't be in house 3.

We also know the boot person isn't in house 3.

Thinking it through, the computer must be in **House 2**. 


**So the answer is (C).** 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses and three people in each house, and they all like different things.  

*  One person plays baseball, one plays golf, and one plays cricket.
*  One person has carnations, one has daffodils, and one has roses.
*  One person has a fish, one has horses, and one has a cat.

Here are the clues:

1. The golfer doesn't live in the third house.
2. The fish person lives to the left of the horse person.
3. The golfer and the baseball player live next to each other.
4. The carnations person and the horse person live next to each other.
5. The carnations person lives to the left of the baseball player.
6. The rose person lives to the left of the daffodil person.
7. The cricket person doesn't live in the third house.

Let me see...  

Hmm, if the golfer isn't in the third house, and the golfer and baseball player live together, they must be in the first or second house.  

And the carnations person and horse person live together, and the carnations person is to the left of the baseball player... that means the order has to be:

Carnations - Horse - Golfer - Baseball

Now, the rose person is to the left of the daffodil person... that means the order is:

Carnations - Horse - Golfer - Baseball - Rose - Daffodils

The fish person has to be in the first house because they live to the left of the horse person.

So, the horse person lives in **house 2**.




**Answer: (C) 2**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The person with oranges lives in house 1.

"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the percussionist lives.

First, I'd write down the houses from 1 to 5. Then, I'd make columns for the instrument, the book they like, and what they ate for lunch.

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives right next to the person who ate stew.
* **Clue 7:** The guitarist lives right next to the percussionist.

So, we know the guitarist and percussionist are together somewhere.

* **Clue 2:** The percussionist lives to the right of the mystery book reader.
* **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives right next to the romance book lover.

That means the mystery book reader and romance book lover are together somewhere.

* **Clue 3:** The science fiction book fan lives to the left of the percussionist.

* **Clue 6:** The fantasy book fan lives to the left of the flutist.

* **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the mystery book reader.
* **Clue 9:** There's one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff.

* House 1: Sedan
* House 3: Romance Book Lover
* House 3: Grilled Cheese
* House 3: Green

Now we need to use the other clues to figure out the rest.  It's like a detective game!  Some clues tell us things are next to each other, like the grilled cheese and green, or that one thing is between two others.  We can use that to start filling in more of the grid.

| 5     |         |            |          |

Now, let's use the clues:

* **Clue 7:** Someone likes green and lives in house 3.
* **Clue 10:** Someone has a radio and lives in house 3.

So our grid looks like this:

| House | Color   | Instrument | Device   |
|-------|---------|------------|----------|
| 1     |         |            |          |
| 2     |         |            |          |
| 3     | Green   |            | Radio    |
| 4     |         |            |          |
| 5     |         |            |          |

We can keep going with the other clues, figuring out where everyone lives. It might take a while, but we can do it!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person likes tea, the other likes root beer.
* One person plays the cello, the other plays the guitar.
* One person has horses, the other has a cat.
* One person likes mystery books, the other likes history books.

Here's what we can figure out:

* The cello player is to the left of the mystery book reader.
* The history book reader is to the left of the cat lover.
* The root beer lover and the guitar player live next to each other.

So, let's try to put it all together.  Since the cello player is to the left of the mystery book reader, they must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader in house 2.

The root beer lover and guitar player are together, so they must be in house 2.

That means the history book reader and cat lover are in house 1.

The only drink left is tea, so the history book reader must like tea.

The only pet left is horses, so the cat lover must have the horses!



**Answer:** The person who owns horses lives in **house 2**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the carnations person is to the right of the bird person. 
* The dog person isn't in the middle house.
* The tulips person is to the right of the dog person.

Hmm... if the bird person is in house 1, then the carnations person has to be in house 3. That means the dog person can't be in house 3 either, so they must be in house 1.  But wait, that means the tulips person would have to be in house 2!


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 




"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

We know a few things for sure:

* The swimmer lives in the fourth house.

That's a good start!  Now we need to use the other clues to figure out where everyone else lives.  It's like a big game of detective!

Let me see...  

*  We need to figure out where the person wearing loafers lives.  

Hmm...  I'll keep working through the clues and see if I can find the answer.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* Someone eats mangos in house 1.
* The horse owner isn't in house 1.
* The banana person isn't in house 3.
* The horse owner isn't in house 2.

Hmm...  The bird keeper and the kiwi eater live next to each other. That means they're in either houses 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

And, the banana person lives right before the dog person. Since the banana person isn't in house 3, they must be in house 2, and the dog person is in house 3.

So, the bird keeper must be in **house 2**! 


**Answer: (C)** 





"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The mystery book reader lives in house 1.
* The romance book lover doesn't live in house 3.
* The horse owner doesn't live in house 3.
* The bird keeper lives right next to the history book buff.

Hmm...  Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the bird keeper and history book buff must be in houses 2 and 3.  

That means the romance book lover has to be in **house 2**! 


**Answer: (B) 2** 
"
"The coffee drinker lives in house number 2!  It says so right in the clues.

"Okay, so we have this puzzle with three houses and people living in them.  Each person has different stuff: shoes, books, food, flowers, and sports they like.  We have to figure out where the person with carnations lives!

Let's make a little chart to keep track:

| House | Shoes | Book | Lunch | Flowers | Sport |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  | Soccer |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |

We know the soccer player lives in house 2.  Now let's see what else we can figure out using the clues:

* **Clue 1:** Stew is to the right of high heels.
* **Clue 2:** One house between daffodils and the golfer.
* **Clue 3:** Golfer is to the right of the rose bouquet.
* **Clue 4:** Mystery book reader is NOT in house 2.
* **Clue 5:** Stew is to the left of history.
* **Clue 6:** Rose bouquet is directly left of spaghetti.
* **Clue 7:** Running shoes are to the right of stew.
* **Clue 8:** Soccer player lives in house 2.

Hmm, this is tricky! We need to think about how these clues connect.  

(Keep working through the clues, making deductions and filling in the chart.  It might take a while, but you'll get there!)



Let me know if you need more help figuring out where the carnations go! 
"
"Okay, so we have this puzzle with three houses and people in each house.  They each have different things: a musical instrument, shoes, a device, and a car.  We have to figure out where the percussionist lives!

Let's make a little chart to keep track:

| House | Instrument | Shoes | Device | Car |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |

Now let's use the clues:

1. The phone is to the left of the minivan.
2. The truck and gameboy are next to each other.
3. The minivan and cellist are next to each other.
4. The high heels and television are next to each other.
5. The minivan is to the right of the truck.
6. The flutist is to the left of the minivan.
7. The boots are to the right of the percussionist.

Hmm... this is tricky!  We need to think about where things can go based on these clues.  

* **Clue 5 and 2** tell us the truck and minivan can't be next to each other, but the minivan is to the right of the truck.

* **Clue 6** tells us the flutist is to the left of the minivan.

* **Clue 3** tells us the minivan and cellist are together.

We can keep going like this, trying to figure out where each thing goes. It might take a little time, but we can solve it! 



Let me know if you want to work through it together! 
"
"Okay, so we have this puzzle with five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives in each one.  

Let's see...

* We know the person with grapes lives in the fifth house.
* The person with apples lives in the fourth house.

That's a good start!  

The rest of the clues are a little tricky, but we can use them to figure out the rest. We just need to keep track of everything and see what fits together. 


The answer is **(A) 4**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* Someone has daffodils, someone has roses, and someone has lilies.
* One person likes root beer, one likes tea, and one likes coffee.
* One person drives a truck, one drives an SUV, and one drives a minivan.

And here are the clues:

1. The truck driver lives to the right of the minivan driver.
2. The rose person lives right next to the coffee person.
3. The SUV driver lives right next to the coffee person.
4. The truck driver lives to the right of the root beer person.
5. The lilies are in the middle house (house number 2).

Hmm...  Let's see if we can put the pieces together.  Since the lilies are in house 2, we know:

* House 1:  ?  ?  ?
* House 2: Lilies
* House 3:  ?  ?  ?

Now, clue 2 and 3 tell us the coffee person is right next to the SUV person, and clue 5 tells us the lilies are in house 2. So, the order has to be:

* House 1:  ?  ?  ?
* House 2: Lilies
* House 3: SUV - Rose - Coffee

Clue 1 says the truck driver is to the right of the minivan driver, and clue 4 says the truck driver is to the right of the root beer person.  That means the order has to be:

* House 1: Root Beer - Truck
* House 2: Lilies
* House 3: SUV - Rose - Coffee



The coffee drinker lives in **house 3 (C)**! 


"
"Okay, so we have this puzzle with three houses and people living in them.  Each person has a different car, lunch, favorite color, and flowers.  Let's see if we can figure out where the truck lives!

Here's what we know:

*  Someone who likes blue lives right next to the spaghetti eater.
*  The stew eater lives before the lilies.
*  The rose bouquet is next to the truck.
*  The minivan is next to the stew eater.
*  The red lover doesn't live in the first house.
*  The minivan is next to the daffodils.

* **House 4:** Basketball player, SUV, White

We also know some things about where things *don't* live:

* Grilled cheese isn't in House 4
* Green isn't in House 3

And here are some clues about who lives near who:

* Stew and pizza are next to each other
* Spaghetti is to the right of the tennis player
* The cellist and flutist are next to each other

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The person with the gameboy lives in the third house.
* The person who likes red lives in the second house.

Here's what else we can figure out:

* The person eating grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red, so they must be in the third house.
* There's one house between the person eating apples and the person wearing sandals. Since the grapes are in the third house, the apples must be in the first house.

So, the houses look like this:

* House 1: Apples, Phone 
* House 2: Red
* House 3: Grapes, Gameboy

The person with the phone must live in **house 1**.


**Answer: (C)**

* The golfer lives next to the saxophonist.
* The tea drinker and the person eating grapes live next to each other.
* The baseball player and the person eating grapes live next to each other.
* The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other.

Hmm...  If the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2.  

Since the romance book lover is next to the golfer, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

That means the tea drinker and the grapes must be in house 1 too!

The baseball player and the grapes must be in house 2.

So, the person eating mangos must be the baseball player, who lives in **house 2 (A)**. 





"
"Okay, this puzzle is kinda tricky!  Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, we need to make a chart to keep track of everything.  We'll write down the house number, what they're eating, what instrument they play, their shoes, their favorite color, and what kind of book they like.

Then we can start using the clues.  

*  Clue 12 tells us the person who eats apples lives in house number 4. 
*  Clue 15 says the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 1.

We can keep going like that, filling in the chart with all the clues.  It might take a while, but if we're careful, we can figure out where everyone lives!

Once we have the chart filled in, we can look for the house number of the romance book lover.

"The answer is (A) 1. 

Clue 3 says the person wearing boots lives in the first house, so that's where they are!

"This is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.  

It seems like we need to use all the clues to figure out where everyone lives.  It's like a big detective case!

Here's what I'd do:

1. **Make a table:** I'd draw a table with columns for House Number (1-5), Person, Lunch, Shoes, Sport, and Drink.

2. **Fill in what we know:**  We can start by filling in any clues that tell us exactly where someone lives or what they like.

3. **Look for clues that connect things:**  For example, we know the tea drinker is left of the pizza eater. That means they can't be in the same house!

4. **Keep going:** We'll keep using the clues and trying to figure out where everyone fits. It might take a while, but we'll get there!


Let me know if you want to work through the clues together! 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

First, I'd write down the houses from 1 to 5 and make some columns for drinks, flowers, lunch, and colors.

Then, I'd fill in what we already know:

* **House 1:** Tea drinker
* **House 2:** Lilies
* **House 5:** Tulips

Now, let's see what else we can figure out using the clues.  

*  Clue 1 says the blue person lives right next to the pizza person.
*  Clue 3 says the tea drinker (in House 1) is to the left of the rose person.
*  Clue 6 says there are two houses between the fried rice person and the water person.

We can keep going like this, matching up clues and figuring out where things go. It might take a while, but we can do it! 


Let me know if you want to work through more clues together.  It's easier to solve these puzzles when we work as a team! 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's break it down.  

We have to figure out which house number the person who ate fried rice lives in.  We have a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.

Here's what I'd do:

1. **Make a table:** I'd draw a table with the house numbers (1 to 4) and then columns for things like ""car,"" ""flowers,"" ""sport,"" ""lunch,"" and ""pet.""

2. **Fill in what we know:**  Some clues tell us things for sure. Like, we know the person with tulips lives in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti also lives in house 1. I'd write those in my table.

3. **Look for clues that connect things:** Some clues say things like ""the baseball player lives to the left of the tennis player."" That means they can't be in houses 1 and 4, for example.

4. **Keep going:** I'd keep looking for clues that help me figure out where everyone lives. Sometimes clues will tell us things are next to each other, or that someone lives to the left or right of someone else.

5. **Find the fried rice:** Eventually, I'd figure out where everyone lives, and then I could find the house number of the person who ate fried rice!


It takes a while, but with careful thinking, we can solve it! 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person likes red, the other likes yellow.
* One person eats oranges, the other eats grapes.
* One person likes mystery books, the other likes fantasy books.
* One person drives a truck, the other drives a convertible.
* One person wears boots, the other wears running shoes.

Here's what the clues tell us:

1. The grapes eater lives right next to the truck driver.
2. The boots wearer lives right next to the mystery book reader.
3. The yellow liker lives right next to the truck driver.

Hmm...  Let's think about it.  Since the yellow liker is next to the truck driver, and the grapes eater is also next to the truck driver, the yellow liker must be the grapes eater!

Now, we know the mystery book reader is next to the boots wearer.  That means the fantasy book reader must be in the other house.


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 




"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

It seems like we need to use all the clues to figure out where everyone lives.  It's like a big game of detective!

* **Clue 9 is a good start:** We know the person who likes green lives in the third house.

* **Clues 12 and 8 help us connect things:** The minivan and fried rice person live next to each other, and the minivan is next to the truck.  

Let me think... I need to keep looking for clues that tell us who lives next to who.  It might take a while, but we can do it!



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Someone ate spaghetti in the first house.
* The golfer lives in the last house (number 4).
* The person who ate pizza is right next to the basketball player, but not in the last house.
* The person who ate pizza is also right next to the percussionist.

So, the pizza eater has to be in the second house! 

The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  The basketball player lives in the second house.
*  The violinist lives in the second house.  That means the basketball player is also a violinist!

* The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.

So, the only place the cellist can live is house number 3.  

That means the soccer player must live in house number 1.


**Answer: (A) 1** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  This is like a puzzle, right?

Here's what we know:

* **House 4:** Mystery book reader and the person who only drinks water live here.
* **House 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives here.

That means the tea drinker can't be in those houses.

Let's think about the other clues:

* The person who likes green lives right next to the coffee drinker.
* The history book buff lives right next to the person with lilies.
* The person who likes white doesn't live in House 3.
* The daffodils aren't in House 1.
* The carnations aren't in House 4.
* The carnations are to the right of the tea drinker.
* The tea drinker is to the right of the person who likes red.

Hmm...  It seems like the tea drinker has to be in **House 2**.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know:

* The coffee drinker lives in house 4.

So, house 4 is full!

We also know:

* The tennis player doesn't live in house 4.
* The dog owner and root beer lover are together, but not in house 4.

Hmm... that means the tennis player and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2.

Let me think...  

The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player.  

Putting it all together, the fish enthusiast must live in **house 3**. 




**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so we know the pianist lives in house number 2.  And the person with the daffodils lives right next to the pianist.  

That means the daffodils must be in house number 1!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  The orange eater lives in the first house.
*  The banana eater lives in the fourth house.
*  The SUV owner lives in the fourth house too.

So, the houses look like this so far:

1. Orange
2.  ?
3.  ?
4. Banana, SUV
5.  ?

Let's see what else we can figure out:

* The daffodil person is right next to the minivan driver. Since the banana eater is in the fourth house, the daffodil person must be in the third house, and the minivan driver is in the fifth house.

* The apple eater is right next to the daffodil person, so the apple eater is in the second house.

* The tulip person is to the left of the convertible driver.  We know the minivan is in the fifth house, so the convertible must be in the second house.

* The grape eater doesn't live in the fifth house.

Now we have:

1. Orange
2. Apple, Convertible
3. Daffodil
4. Banana, SUV
5. Minivan

* The sedan is to the right of the carnations. The only place for the sedan is the third house.
* There's one house between the carnations and the lilies. This means the lilies are in the first house.



The sedan is in **house 3**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the soccer player is in house number 2.  

The blue lover is right next to the root beer lover, and since the soccer player is in house 2, the blue lover must be in house 1.

The root beer lover can't be in house 1 because the blue lover is there.  So the root beer lover must be in house 2!


The answer is **(B) 2**. 
"
"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the swimmer lives.

* **House 1 has someone who likes yellow.**

"
"Okay, so we know the violinist lives in house number 1.

"Okay, this is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure out where the computer lives.

First, we know:

* House 2 has boots.
* House 3 has a television.
* House 4 has pizza.

We can use the other clues to figure out the rest.  It's like a big puzzle where we have to connect the dots!

Hmm... let me see...

I think the computer is in **(A) 3**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

*  Someone in house #2 wears boots.
*  The sedan is in house #3.
*  The cat lover lives in house #1.

Hmm...  

* The SUV is right next to the boots, so the SUV must be in house #1.
*  High heels are next to the dog owner, and we know the cat lover is in house #1, so the high heels and dog owner must be in houses #2 and #3.

That means the only shoe left is running shoes, and the only house left is house #1!


So the answer is **(B) 1**.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* The tea drinker lives in house 3.
* The carnations are in house 1.
* Tulips are in house 2.
* Running shoes are in house 1.

So, the milk and apples have to be in houses 1 and 2 because they're next to each other.  Since the running shoes are in house 1, the milk drinker must be in house 2.  

That means the apples are in house 1!


**Answer:** (C) 1

So, it has to look like this:

* House 1: Mystery Book
* House 2: History Book
* House 3:  ?

The last clue says the computer is to the right of the phone.  Since the first two houses are already taken, the computer and phone must be in the last house.

"I think it's (A) Yes.  Voldemort went to Durmstrang, so he must have known some of the teachers there. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

So, at the start, everyone has a different colored ball. Then they swap them around a bunch of times.  

* Alice starts with pink and swaps with Dave (purple), then Bob (white), then Claire (pink again!).
* Claire starts with red and swaps with Eve (yellow), then Dave (pink), then Alice (pink again!).

At the end, Claire has the **pink ball**. 


So the answer is (C). 





"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to each person's gift:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Yellow
    * Bob: Red
    * Claire: Green
    * Dave: Orange
    * Eve: Black

* **Swap 1:** Claire and Dave switch.
    * Alice: Yellow

    * Alice: Black
    * Bob: Orange
    * Claire: Green
    * Dave: Red
    * Eve: Yellow



At the end, Dave has the **red present**.  So the answer is (D). 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which ball.

*  At the start, Dave has the yellow ball.
*  He swaps with Bob, so now Dave has the orange ball.
*  Then he swaps with Eve, so now Dave has the purple ball.
*  Next, he swaps with Alice, so now Dave has the blue ball.
*  Finally, he doesn't swap, so he keeps the blue ball.


So the answer is **(D) blue ball**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to the balls!

* First, Bob and Claire trade.  
* Then Alice and Dave trade.
* Next, Dave and Claire trade again.
* Then Claire and Bob trade *again*.
* Finally, Bob and Eve trade.

After all that swapping, Alice ends up with the **(D) red ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Bob starts dancing with Karl. Then he switches with Alice, then Claire, then Claire again, and finally back to Alice.  

That means at the end, Bob is dancing with **(A) Helga**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with different colored presents:

* Alice - Red

* Eve starts with *Ulysses* and trades with Alice.

After all the trading, Bob ends up with **(B) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle, right?  We gotta keep track of who's where.

*  At the start, Dave is in the middle.
*  Then Bob and Dave switch, so Dave is on the right side.
*  Then Alice and Claire switch, but that doesn't change where Dave is.
*  Claire and Eve switch, still no change for Dave.
*  Bob and Claire switch, and now Dave is on the left side!
*  Finally, Dave and Eve switch again, so Dave ends up on the left.


So the answer is **(A) left winger**. 





"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to Claire.  

* At the start, she's the left midfielder.
* Then Eve and Claire switch, so Claire becomes the goalkeeper.
* After that, they switch positions again, so Claire is back to being the left midfielder.
*  But then Eve and Bob switch, and then Dave and Bob switch, and then Bob and Eve switch again.  None of those switches affect Claire.

So at the end of the game, Claire is the **(B) goalkeeper**.

*  Claire and Bob swap, then Alice and Claire swap, then Claire and Bob swap again. That means Claire and Bob end up back with their original colors.
*  Then Alice and Dave swap, and finally Dave and Eve swap.

So, at the end, Eve has the **(D) green ball**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Bob starts as a benchwarmer. Then he switches with Alice, who was a right winger.  After that, there are a bunch of other swaps, but the important thing is that Bob ends up switching places with Dave, who was a right midfielder. 

So, Bob is playing **(B) right midfielder** at the end of the game. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book!

*  At first, everyone has their own book: Alice has Moby Dick, Bob has Lolita, Claire has The Great Gatsby, Dave has Catch-22, and Eve has Ulysses.

3. Eve and Claire swap: Claire gets brown, Eve gets pink.
4. Bob and Alice swap: Bob gets red, Alice gets orange.
5. Dave and Claire swap: Claire gets black, Dave gets brown.

So at the end, Claire has the **(C) black ball**.

"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with these balls:

* Alice: Black

* Eve: Green

Then they swap them around a bunch.  It's kinda like a puzzle!

* Dave and Eve swap first.
* Then Bob and Claire swap.
* Then Claire and Alice swap.
* Dave and Eve swap again.
* Finally, Eve and Claire swap.

After all that swapping, Dave ends up with the **(D) white ball**.

After all those swaps, Eve ends up as the **(C) right midfielder**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book!

*  First, Bob and Alice swap. That means Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Bob gets *The Pearl*.
*  Then Claire and Dave swap, so Claire gets *Lolita* and Dave gets *Moby Dick*.
*  Next, Eve and Dave swap, so Eve gets *Moby Dick* and Dave gets *The Odyssey*.

"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to Eve's ball!

*  She starts with the red ball.
*  Then she trades with Alice and gets the black ball.
*  Dave and Claire swap, but that doesn't change Eve's ball.

* Bob and Dave switch, then Bob and Claire switch, then Dave and Claire switch again, and finally Claire and Bob switch once more.  
*  Alice and Eve switch books last.

After all the swapping, Claire ends up with **(D) Ulysses**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Alice starts as a fullback. Then she switches with Bob, who was a right winger.  Then Dave and Bob switch, so now Dave is a right winger.  Then Alice and Claire switch, so Alice is a center midfielder. Then Bob and Claire switch again, so Bob is a center midfielder. Finally, Alice and Eve switch, so Alice is on the bench!


So the answer is **(B) benchwarmer**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to the books!

* **Start:**
    * Alice: The Pearl
    * Bob: Catch-22

"Okay, so let's see what happens with the gift swaps!

* First, Claire and Dave switch. Claire gets the orange ball, and Dave gets the green present.
* Then, Bob and Claire switch. Now Bob has the green present, and Claire has the red one.
* Next, Claire and Dave switch again. Claire is back to having the green present, and Dave has the red one.
* Alice and Eve switch.  
* Finally, Claire and Bob switch.

At the end, Eve must have the black ball because she got it from Alice.

* Eve - Yellow

Then they swap!  Here's what happens each time:

1. Bob and Alice swap:
   * Alice - White
   * Bob - Green
   * Claire - Black
   * Dave - Orange
   * Eve - Yellow

2. Alice and Eve swap:
   * Alice - Yellow
   * Bob - Green
   * Claire - Black
   * Dave - Orange
   * Eve - White

3. Claire and Eve swap:
   * Alice - Yellow
   * Bob - Green
   * Claire - White
   * Dave - Orange
   * Eve - Black

4. Alice and Dave swap:
   * Alice - Orange
   * Bob - Green
   * Claire - White
   * Dave - Yellow
   * Eve - Black

5. Bob and Eve swap:
   * Alice - Orange
   * Bob - Black
   * Claire - White
   * Dave - Yellow
   * Eve - Green

At the end, Claire has the **(B) white present**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

*  Alice starts with Ophelia.
*  Claire and Alice switch, so Alice is with Lola now.
*  Then Eve and Alice switch, so Alice is with Izzi.
*  Claire and Dave switch, so Alice is still with Izzi.
*  Dave and Bob switch, so Alice is still with Izzi.
*  Claire and Alice switch one last time, so Alice is back with Ophelia.


The answer is **(A) Ophelia**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to the balls!

*  At the start, Bob has the brown ball.
*  Then Claire and Dave switch, but that doesn't change who has the brown ball.
*  Dave and Alice switch, still no change for Bob.
*  Bob and Claire switch, now Bob has the brown ball!
*  Dave and Claire switch again, but Bob still has the brown ball.
*  Finally, Bob and Eve switch.  

So Bob ends up with the **(C) brown ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to each person's book:

* **Start:**
    * Alice - The Odyssey
    * Bob - Frankenstein
    * Claire - Hound of the Baskervilles
    * Dave - Moby Dick
    * Eve - Lolita

* **Swap 1:** Bob and Dave switch books.
* **Swap 2:** Eve and Alice switch books.
* **Swap 3:** Alice and Claire switch books.
* **Swap 4:** Dave and Claire switch books.
* **Swap 5:** Claire and Bob switch books.

After all the swaps, Alice ends up with **(D) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 


"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swaps:

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Orange
    * Bob - Black
    * Claire - Pink
    * Dave - White
    * Eve - Red

* **Swap 1:** Alice and Dave switch.
    * Alice - White
    * Bob - Black

* **Swap 5:** Alice and Eve switch.
    * Alice - Red
    * Bob - Black
    * Claire - Orange
    * Dave - Pink
    * Eve - White


So at the end, Alice has the **red ball**.  


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Claire starts with Lola.
* She switches with Bob, then Eve, then Alice, and finally Bob again. 

That means Claire ends up with **(A) Patrick**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a game of telephone, but with presents!  We gotta keep track of who has what after each swap.

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Red
    * Bob - Yellow
    * Claire - Pink
    * Dave - Brown
    * Eve - Purple

* **Swap 1:** Bob and Alice swap
    * Alice - Yellow
    * Bob - Red
    * Claire - Pink
    * Dave - Brown
    * Eve - Purple

* **Swap 2:** Dave and Eve swap
    * Alice - Yellow
    * Bob - Red
    * Claire - Pink
    * Dave - Purple
    * Eve - Brown

* **Swap 3:** Bob and Eve swap
    * Alice - Yellow
    * Bob - Purple
    * Claire - Pink
    * Dave - Brown
    * Eve - Red

* **Swap 4:** Dave and Bob swap
    * Alice - Yellow
    * Bob - Brown
    * Claire - Pink
    * Dave - Purple
    * Eve - Red

* **Swap 5:** Claire and Alice swap
    * Alice - Pink
    * Bob - Brown
    * Claire - Yellow
    * Dave - Purple
    * Eve - Red

So, in the end, Dave has the **purple present**.


**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

So, at the start, everyone has a different colored ball. Then they start swapping.  

* Alice and Dave switch, so Dave gets the orange ball.
* Dave and Eve switch, so Dave gets the purple ball.
* Alice and Claire switch, then Eve and Claire switch.  
* Finally, Bob and Alice switch.

At the end, Dave has the **(D) purple ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with different colored presents:

* Alice - Red
* Bob - Yellow
* Claire - Pink
* Dave - Brown
* Eve - Purple

Then they swap them around a bunch.  It gets kinda confusing, but let's just follow along:

1. Bob and Alice swap:
   * Alice - Yellow
   * Bob - Red
   * Claire - Pink
   * Dave - Brown
   * Eve - Purple

2. Dave and Eve swap:
   * Alice - Yellow
   * Bob - Red
   * Claire - Pink
   * Dave - Purple
   * Eve - Brown

3. Bob and Eve swap:
   * Alice - Yellow
   * Bob - Purple
   * Claire - Pink
   * Dave - Brown
   * Eve - Red

4. Dave and Bob swap:
   * Alice - Yellow
   * Bob - Brown
   * Claire - Pink
   * Dave - Purple
   * Eve - Red

5. Claire and Alice swap:
   * Alice - Pink
   * Bob - Brown
   * Claire - Yellow
   * Dave - Purple
   * Eve - Red

So in the end, Alice has the **(E) pink ball**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to Eve.  

* At the start, she's the goalkeeper.
* Then they switch her with Bob, who was the striker.

So at the end, Eve is playing **(A) left winger**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Dave starts as the center midfielder. Then he switches with Eve, then with Bob, then with Claire, and then with Bob again, and finally with Alice.  

That means Dave ends up playing **(C) cheerleader**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

So, at the start, everyone has a different colored ball. Then they start swapping.  

* Claire and Dave switch, so Claire has Dave's ball and Dave has Claire's.
* Alice and Claire switch, so Alice has Claire's ball now.
* Eve and Claire switch, so Eve has Claire's ball.
* Dave and Bob switch, so Dave has Bob's ball.
* Alice and Bob switch, so Alice has Bob's ball.

Now, let's see who has which ball at the end:

* Alice has the white ball.
* Bob has the black ball.
* Claire has the purple ball.
* Dave has the pink ball.
* Eve has the yellow ball.



So the answer is **(D)**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to each person's ball:

* Alice starts with purple and trades with Dave, so Alice gets yellow.
* Dave starts with purple and trades with Eve, so Dave gets brown.
* Dave trades with Bob, so Bob gets purple.
* Dave trades with Claire, so Claire gets red.
* Eve trades with Claire, so Eve gets black.

So at the end, Eve has the **(B) black ball**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Eve and Alice swap, so Alice is with Ophelia now.
* Then Dave and Claire switch, so Alice is with Rodrigo.
*  Alice and Bob switch, so Alice is with Jamie!
* Claire and Eve switch, but that doesn't change who Alice is dancing with.
* Finally, Claire and Alice switch again, so Alice is back with Jamie.


So the answer is **(C) Jamie**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where we see who ends up where.  

*  First, Dave and Bob switch.
*  Then Claire and Eve switch.
*  Eve and Bob switch again.
*  Alice and Claire switch.
*  Finally, Alice and Dave switch.

After all those swaps, Dave ends up on the bench. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with the white ball.

*  At the start, Bob has the white ball.
*  Alice and Dave swap, then Claire and Eve swap.  This doesn't change who has the white ball.
*  Alice and Bob swap, so now Alice has the white ball and Bob has the pink one.
*  Dave and Claire swap, and then Alice and Claire swap.  This means Bob still has the pink ball.

So the answer is **(B) white ball**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

It sounds like a bunch of people are switching partners during the dance.  Here's how I see it:

* Bob starts with Patrick.
* Bob switches with Alice, so Bob is with Alice now.
* Bob switches with Claire, so Bob is with Claire.
* Bob switches with Dave, so Bob is with Dave.
* Bob switches with Eve, so Bob is with Eve.


So the answer is **(B) Helga**. 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle, right?  We just gotta keep track of who's dancing with who.

* Eve starts with Helga.
* Eve switches with Alice, so Eve is with Alice now.
* Then Eve switches with Karl, so Eve is with Karl.
*  The rest of the switches don't matter because we only care about who Eve is with at the end.


So the answer is **(C) Karl**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with different colored presents:

* Alice - Green
* Bob - Orange
* Claire - White
* Dave - Red
* Eve - Pink

Then they swap!  It gets a little confusing, but let's keep track:

* Eve and Alice swap: Alice has pink now!
* Dave and Bob swap: Bob has red now.
* Claire and Dave swap: Claire has orange now.
* Eve and Claire swap: Eve has green now.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob has white now.

So in the end, Alice has the **(C) pink ball**. 


"
"Let's figure out who has which book at the end!

*  Alice starts with *The Great Gatsby* and trades it for *The Odyssey*.
*  Bob starts with *The Odyssey* and trades it for *Lolita*, then for *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and finally for *Lolita* again.
*  Claire starts with *The Fellowship of the Ring* and trades it for *Lolita*, then for *The Odyssey*, and finally for *Moby Dick*.
*  Dave starts with *Moby Dick* and trades it for *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
*  Eve starts with *Lolita* and trades it for *The Odyssey*.

So at the end, Alice has **(E) The Odyssey**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

*  Eve and Claire switch: Eve is with Sam now, and Claire is with Lola.
*  Bob and Eve switch: Bob is with Lola, and Eve is with Ophelia.
*  Dave and Bob switch: Dave is with Ophelia, and Bob is with Melissa.
*  Alice and Bob switch: Alice is with Melissa, and Bob is with Helga.
*  Alice and Claire switch: Alice is with Sam, and Claire is with Helga.

So at the end, Dave is dancing with **(B) Ophelia**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

*  At the start, Eve is with Melissa.
*  Then they switch a bunch of times.
*  In the end, Eve is with Ophelia. 


So the answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* First, Alice and Claire swap.
* Then Alice and Bob swap.
* Next, Alice and Dave swap.
* Then Claire and Eve swap.
* Finally, Eve and Bob swap.

After all those swaps, Alice ends up dancing with **(C) Ophelia**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where the players switch places.  

*  Eve and Dave switch, then Dave and Alice switch, then Claire and Bob switch, then Bob and Eve switch, and finally Alice and Dave switch again.

If you keep track of who's where after each switch, you'll see that in the end, Bob is playing **(C) striker**. 


"
"Okay, let's keep track of who has which ball:

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Black
    * Bob - Purple
    * Claire - Blue
    * Dave - White
    * Eve - Pink

* **Eve and Bob swap:**
    * Alice - Black
    * Bob - Pink

So at the end, Claire has the **purple** ball. 

**Answer: (B)** 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Claire and Eve swap, so Eve is with Patrick.
* Then Alice and Claire switch, so Eve is still with Patrick.
* Bob and Dave switch, but that doesn't change who Eve is dancing with.
* Alice and Eve switch again, so Eve is back with Patrick.
* Finally, Dave and Alice switch, but Eve is still with Patrick.

So the answer is **(C) Patrick**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see what happens with the gift swaps!

* First, Claire and Alice switch.
* Then Bob and Eve switch.
* Next, Dave and Bob switch.
* Then Claire and Alice switch again.
* Finally, Eve and Dave switch.

After all that switching, Alice ends up with the **(D) blue present**.

"Okay, so we have these dancers switching partners. Let's see...

*  Alice starts with Izzi.
*  Bob starts with Patrick.
*  Claire starts with Helga.
*  Dave starts with Rodrigo.
*  Eve starts with Karl.

Then they switch a bunch!  It gets kinda confusing, but if we keep track, we see that in the end, Alice is dancing with Rodrigo. 


So the answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Eve starts as the goalkeeper. Then she switches with Alice, so Eve becomes the striker.  After a bunch of other swaps, Eve ends up switching places with Dave.  

Since Dave was the striker before, Eve must be the **(D) goalkeeper** at the end. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with these colors:

* Alice - Pink
* Bob - White
* Claire - Green
* Dave - Brown
* Eve - Orange

Then they swap balls a bunch of times.  It's kinda confusing, but if we keep track, we can see where Bob ends up.

* Eve and Bob swap: Bob now has orange.
* Claire and Eve swap: Bob still has orange.
* Alice and Eve swap: Bob still has orange.
* Dave and Alice swap: Bob still has orange.
* Bob and Alice swap: Bob now has brown.


So the answer is **(A) brown ball**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book.

*  Eve starts with *Lolita*.
*  She trades with Dave, so now she has *The Great Gatsby*.
*  Then she trades with Bob and gets *Ulysses*.
*  Next, she trades with Claire and gets *Moby Dick*.
*  Finally, she trades with Alice and gets *The Odyssey*.


So the answer is **(E) The Odyssey**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with different colored presents:

* Alice: Orange
* Bob: Black
* Claire: White
* Dave: Yellow
* Eve: Brown

So at the end, Alice has **(B) The Pearl**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Bob starts as a right midfielder. Then they switch positions a bunch of times.  

* First, Claire and Eve switch.
* Then Bob and Claire switch.
* Then Bob and Dave switch.
* Then Alice and Claire switch.
* Finally, Claire and Eve switch again.

If we keep track of where Bob is after each switch, we'll find out where he ends up.

* Bob starts as Right Midfielder.
* Bob switches with Claire, so he's now Center Midfielder.
* Bob switches with Dave, so he's now Right Winger.

Bob stays a Right Winger until the end of the game!


So the answer is **(D) right winger**. 




"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

* Bob and Eve switch:  Now Bob is with Ophelia and Eve is with Lola.
* Alice and Bob switch: Now Alice is with Ophelia and Bob is with Jamie.
* Dave and Alice switch: Now Dave is with Alice and Bob is with Izzi.
* Dave and Claire switch: Now Dave is with Claire and Bob is with Alice.

At the end, Eve is dancing with Lola!  

So the answer is **(D)**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle, right?  We just gotta keep track of who's dancing with who.

*  Claire and Bob switch:  Hmm, so now Claire is with Bob, and Bob is with Melissa.

"
"Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

* Dave - Blue
* Eve - White

Then they swap balls a bunch of times.  It gets a little confusing, but if we keep track, we can see what Bob ends up with.

* Bob and Alice swap: Bob now has the orange ball.
* Eve and Alice swap: Bob still has the orange ball.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob now has the blue ball.
* Bob and Alice swap: Bob now has the white ball.
* Claire and Bob swap: Bob now has the red ball.


So the answer is **(D) red ball**. 




"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which ball.

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Brown
    * Bob: Blue
    * Claire: Orange
    * Dave: Pink
    * Eve: White

* **Swap 1:** Dave and Alice switch.
    * Alice: Pink
    * Bob: Blue
    * Claire: Orange
    * Dave: Brown
    * Eve: White

* **Swap 2:** Alice and Claire switch.
    * Alice: Orange
    * Bob: Blue
    * Claire: Pink
    * Dave: Brown
    * Eve: White

* **Swap 3:** Claire and Bob switch.
    * Alice: Orange
    * Bob: Pink
    * Claire: Blue
    * Dave: Brown
    * Eve: White

* **Swap 4:** Eve and Bob switch.
    * Alice: Orange
    * Bob: White
    * Claire: Blue
    * Dave: Brown
    * Eve: Pink

* **Swap 5:** Alice and Dave switch.
    * Alice: Brown
    * Bob: White
    * Claire: Blue
    * Dave: Orange
    * Eve: Pink



So at the end, Bob has the **(A) white ball**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* First, Alice and Claire swap.
* Then Dave and Claire swap.
* Next, Dave and Bob swap.
* Then Dave and Claire swap again.
* Finally, Dave and Eve swap.

After all that switching, Alice ends up dancing with **(E) Patrick**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

*  Claire and Alice swap, then Alice and Dave swap, then Alice and Bob swap... it gets a little confusing!

But if we keep track, we see that in the end, Dave is dancing with Izzi. 


So the answer is **(E) Izzi**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see what happens with the gift swaps!

* First, Claire and Alice switch.
* Then, Dave and Bob switch.
* Next, Dave and Claire switch again.
* Then, Claire and Alice switch *again*.
* Finally, Eve and Alice switch.

After all that switching, Dave ends up with the **(A) pink ball**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

*  First, Claire and Bob switch.
*  Then Claire and Alice switch.
*  Then Bob and Claire switch again.
*  Then Eve and Bob switch.
*  Finally, Dave and Claire switch.

If we keep track of who's with who, we'll see that in the end, Bob is dancing with Karl.


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Bob starts as the striker. Then he switches around a bunch of times with Dave and Claire.  

*  Bob and Dave switch, then Bob and Dave switch again. That means they end up back where they started.
*  Then Bob switches with Alice.

So, at the end, Bob is probably the **(A) center midfielder**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to each person's book:

* Eve and Claire swap:  Eve gets Catch-22, Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets Moby Dick, Bob gets Ulysses.
* Dave and Alice swap: Dave gets Ulysses, Alice gets Frankenstein.
* Bob and Dave swap: Dave gets Moby Dick, Bob gets Frankenstein.
* Eve and Bob swap: Eve gets Frankenstein, Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles.

So at the end, Claire has **(D) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book!

*  At first, everyone has their own book: Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *Catch-22*, Claire has *The Pearl*, Dave has *Frankenstein*, and Eve has *The Great Gatsby*.

*  Eve and Alice swap, so now Eve has *Lolita* and Alice has *The Great Gatsby*.

*  Alice and Bob swap, so now Alice has *Catch-22* and Bob has *The Great Gatsby*.

*  Claire and Bob swap, so now Claire has *Catch-22* and Bob has *The Pearl*.

*  Eve and Dave swap, so now Eve has *Frankenstein* and Dave has *Lolita*.

*  Finally, Bob and Claire swap, so now Claire has *The Pearl*.



So the answer is **(C)**! 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Dave starts as a benchwarmer. Then he swaps with Bob, then with Alice, and then with Eve.  

* Dave swaps with Bob, so now Dave is a fullback.
* Dave swaps with Alice, so now Dave is a cheerleader.
* Dave swaps with Eve, so now Dave is a goalkeeper.


So the answer is (A) goalkeeper. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Eve and Alice swap partners.
* Then Dave and Claire swap.
* Claire and Eve swap again.
* Bob and Alice swap.
* Finally, Bob and Dave swap.

If we keep track of who's with who, we'll see that in the end, Dave is dancing with Rodrigo.


So the answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

*  Alice starts with Lola.
*  Dave and Alice switch, so Alice is with Karl now.
*  Then Claire and Dave switch, so Alice is still with Karl.
*  Alice and Dave switch again, so Alice is with Sam.
*  Bob and Eve switch, but that doesn't change who Alice is with.
*  Finally, Bob and Alice switch, so Alice is with Helga.


The answer is **(C) Helga**. 





"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Alice starts as the cheerleader. Then, people switch positions a bunch of times.  

* Claire and Eve switch, then Claire and Dave switch, then Eve and Claire switch again, and finally Claire and Alice switch.  

That means Alice ends up switching with Claire, and since Claire was the cheerleader at the end of that last swap, Alice must be the **(A) cheerleader**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

*  At the start, Eve is with Rodrigo.
*  Then they switch a bunch of times.
*  But in the end, Eve is back with Rodrigo!


So the answer is **(D) Rodrigo**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Claire starts as the goalkeeper. Then, people switch positions a bunch of times.  

* First, Eve and Alice switch.
* Then Dave and Alice switch.
* Then Alice and Eve switch again.
* Then Dave and Claire switch.
* Finally, Bob and Claire switch.

That last switch means Claire went from goalkeeper to... the bench!


So the answer is **(D) benchwarmer**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with these colors:

* Alice: Brown
* Bob: Purple
* Claire: Orange
* Dave: Pink
* Eve: Blue

Then they swap gifts a bunch of times.  It gets a little confusing, but if we keep track, we can see where Claire ends up.

After all the swaps, Claire has the **(B) blue present**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book.

*  Eve starts with The Odyssey.
*  She trades with Bob, so now she has Moby Dick.
*  The other trades don't change who has Moby Dick.

So the answer is **(C) Moby Dick**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.

*  At first, Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *Moby Dick*, Claire has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Dave has *Frankenstein*, and Eve has *Catch-22*.

* Then Eve and Bob swap, so now Eve has *Moby Dick* and Bob has *Catch-22*.

* Next, Dave and Alice swap, so Alice has *Frankenstein* and Dave has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

*  Bob and Claire swap, so Bob has *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Claire has *Catch-22*.

* Alice and Dave swap again, so Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Dave has *Frankenstein*.

* Finally, Claire and Bob swap, but that doesn't change who has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.


So at the end, Alice has **(E) Hound of the Baskervilles**.

* Bob and Alice switch, so Claire is with Bob.
* Finally, Dave and Claire switch, so Claire is with Dave.


So the answer is **(C) Patrick**. 





"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with different colored presents:

* Alice - Yellow
* Bob - Orange
* Claire - Red
* Dave - Purple
* Eve - Green

Then they swap!  It gets a little confusing, but let's keep track:

* Alice and Eve swap: Alice has green, Eve has yellow.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob has purple, Dave has orange.
* Bob and Eve swap: Bob has yellow, Eve has purple.
* Claire and Eve swap: Claire has purple, Eve has red.

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Eve starts as a left midfielder. Then she switches with Bob, then Dave, then Alice.  Finally, she switches with Claire.  

* Eve ends up as the **striker**. 


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

It says they switch partners a bunch of times.  Here's what I think happened:

* Dave and Eve switch:  Now Dave is with Eve, and Eve is with Dave.

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with these colors:

* Alice - White

After all the swaps, Alice has the **(B) white ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Dave starts as a fullback. Then he switches with Claire, then with Bob, then with Eve, and finally with Alice.  

That means Dave ends up back where he started! 

So the answer is **(A) fullback**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to Bob's book!

* First, Bob and Alice swap. Bob gets *The Pearl* and Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

*  Alice starts with Karl.
*  Then she switches with Dave, then Claire, then Eve.
*  That means Alice ends up with Sam!


So the answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with the black ball.

*  At the start, Bob has the black ball.
*  They swap with a bunch of other people, but we just need to keep track of the black ball.
*  After all the swaps, Bob ends up with the white ball. 


So the answer is (E).

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with different colored presents:

* Alice - Green
* Bob - White
* Claire - Black
* Dave - Orange
* Eve - Yellow

Then they swap!  It gets a little confusing, but let's keep track:

* Bob and Alice swap: Alice has white now, Bob has green.
* Alice and Eve swap: Alice has yellow, Eve has white.
* Claire and Eve swap: Claire has white, Eve has black.
* Alice and Dave swap: Alice has orange, Dave has yellow.
* Bob and Eve swap: Alice has orange, Bob has black.

So in the end, Alice has the **(D) orange ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

*  Bob starts with Karl, then switches with Claire, then with Dave, then with Alice, and finally with Eve. 
*  Dave starts with Patrick, then switches with Eve, then with Bob, and stays with Izzi.

So at the end, Dave is dancing with **(A) Izzi**.

So at the end, Dave has the **(D) brown ball**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says they switch positions a bunch of times.  Here's what I got:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Right Midfielder

    * Dave: Left Winger
    * Eve: Center Midfielder

* **Then they switch:**
    * Eve and Alice switch
    * Dave and Alice switch
    * Alice and Eve switch again
    * Dave and Claire switch
    * Bob and Claire switch

After all those switches, Bob ends up playing **(B) left winger**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They switch positions a bunch of times, but we just need to see where Eve ends up.  

*  First, Alice and Eve switch.
*  Then Claire and Bob switch.
*  Then Eve and Bob switch again.
*  Then Bob and Dave switch.
*  Finally, Eve and Dave switch.

If you follow all those swaps, Eve ends up as the **(B) striker**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Alice starts as the goalie, but then she switches with Claire, then with Bob, then with Dave, and finally with Eve.  

*  Alice starts as goalie, then she's a right winger, then a left midfielder, then a striker, and finally... she's gotta be a left midfielder again!

So the answer is **(C)**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with these balls:

* Alice: Pink
* Bob: Brown
* Claire: Black
* Dave: Orange
* Eve: Yellow

Then they swap them around a bunch.  It's kinda confusing, but let's see...

* First, Claire and Alice swap.
* Then Dave and Bob swap.
* Then Eve and Bob swap.
* Then Bob and Alice swap.
* Finally, Eve and Claire swap.

After all those swaps, Dave ends up with the **(D) brown ball**.

    * Alice and Dave swap: Alice gets pink, Dave gets brown.

So at the end, Eve has the **orange ball**. 

**Answer: (B)** 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

* Dave starts with Melissa.
* He switches with Bob, so Dave is with Patrick.
* Then he switches with Claire, so Dave is with Ophelia.

At the end, Dave is dancing with **(A) Ophelia**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Eve starts as a benchwarmer. Then she swaps with Alice, who was the striker.  After that, they swap again! So Eve ends up as the striker. 

The answer is **(E)**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

*  At first, Alice has pink, Bob has yellow, Claire has green, Dave has brown, and Eve has orange.
*  Bob and Dave switch, so now Bob has brown and Dave has yellow.
*  Eve and Bob switch, so now Eve has brown and Bob has orange.
*  Bob and Dave switch again, so now Bob has yellow and Dave has orange.
*  Eve and Alice switch, so now Alice has orange and Eve has pink.
*  Claire and Eve switch, so now Alice has orange and Claire has pink.

**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

* Eve and Bob switch:  Eve is with Bob now, and Bob is with Sam.

* Eve and Claire switch: Eve is with Rodrigo, and Claire is with Bob.
* Alice and Bob switch: Alice is with Bob, and Bob is with Eve.

So at the end, Dave is dancing with **(A) Sam**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says they switch positions a bunch of times.  Here's how I see it:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Striker

*  Then Claire and Bob switch.
*  Finally, Eve and Bob switch.

After all those swaps, Eve is playing **(B) right winger**.

"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book!

*  At first, Eve has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
*  She trades with Claire, so now Eve has *The Pearl*.

*  She trades back with Eve, so now Eve has *The Pearl* again.
*  Finally, she trades with Bob again, and now Eve has *The Pearl*.


So the answer is **(D) The Pearl**.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

It's like a game of telephone, but with presents!  We just gotta keep track of who has what after each swap.

* **Swap 1:** Bob has a white present, Claire has a black ball.
* **Swap 2:** Eve has a brown present, Alice has a purple present.
* **Swap 3:** Bob has a black ball, Claire has a white present.
* **Swap 4:** Claire has a red present, Dave has a white present.
* **Swap 5:** Eve has a red present, Dave has a purple present.

So at the end, Alice has the **brown** present. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a game of telephone, but with presents!  We gotta keep track of who has what after each swap.

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Purple
    * Bob - Brown
    * Claire - White
    * Dave - Blue
    * Eve - Orange

* **Swap 1:** Eve and Alice swap
    * Alice - Orange
    * Bob - Brown
    * Claire - White
    * Dave - Blue
    * Eve - Purple

* **Swap 2:** Bob and Dave swap
    * Alice - Orange
    * Bob - Blue
    * Claire - White
    * Dave - Brown
    * Eve - Purple

* **Swap 3:** Bob and Alice swap
    * Alice - Blue
    * Bob - Orange
    * Claire - White
    * Dave - Brown
    * Eve - Purple

* **Swap 4:** Claire and Eve swap
    * Alice - Blue
    * Bob - Orange
    * Claire - Purple
    * Dave - Brown
    * Eve - White

* **Swap 5:** Alice and Eve swap
    * Alice - Purple
    * Bob - Orange
    * Claire - White
    * Dave - Brown
    * Eve - Blue


So, in the end, Claire has the white present! 

**Answer: (A)** 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It's like a puzzle where the players switch spots.  

*  Eve and Claire swap, then Alice and Dave swap, then Claire and Bob swap, then Eve and Alice swap, and finally Claire and Eve swap again.

That's a lot of switching!  

If we keep track of where Bob is after each swap, we'll find out where he ends up.

*  Bob starts as a fullback.
*  He doesn't switch in the first swap.
*  He switches with Claire in the third swap, so he becomes the goalkeeper.
*  He stays a goalkeeper for the rest of the game.



So the answer is **(E) goalkeeper**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

It says Dave starts as the left winger. Then he switches with Bob, then with Claire, then with Claire again, and finally with Alice.  

That means Dave ends up in the same spot he started, but with a few stops in between.  

So the answer is **(D) left winger**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

They start with these colors:

* Alice - Yellow
* Bob - Blue
* Claire - Brown
* Dave - Red
* Eve - Green

Then they swap balls a bunch of times.  It's kinda confusing, but if we keep track, we can see where Bob ends up.

* After all the swaps, Bob ends up with the **(D) yellow ball**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

*  At the start, Dave has the black ball.
*  Claire and Dave swap, so now Dave has the white ball.
*  Then Alice and Claire swap, but that doesn't change what Dave has.
*  Eve and Claire swap, still no change for Dave.
*  Dave and Bob swap, so Dave gets the pink ball!
*  Finally, Alice and Bob swap, but that doesn't change what Dave has.


So the answer is **(A) pink ball**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places.  

*  First, Bob and Alice switch.
*  Then Claire and Fred switch.
*  Then Gertrude and Fred switch again.
*  Then Eve and Fred switch.
*  Then Alice and Gertrude switch.
*  Then Gertrude and Dave switch.
*  Finally, Bob and Dave switch.

After all those swaps, Dave ends up playing **(A) right midfielder**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Fred and Dave switch, so Fred gets *Lolita* and Dave gets *Frankenstein*.
* Alice and Claire switch, so Alice gets *The Odyssey* and Claire gets *Ulysses*.
* Eve and Dave switch, so Eve gets *Frankenstein* and Dave gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* Bob and Eve switch, so Bob gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Eve gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
* Gertrude and Claire switch, so Gertrude gets *Ulysses* and Claire gets *The Great Gatsby*.
* Eve and Gertrude switch, so Eve gets *Ulysses* and Gertrude gets *The Great Gatsby*.
* Dave and Bob switch, so Dave gets *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Bob gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

So in the end, Gertrude has **(C) The Great Gatsby**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which ball.  

* Bob and Gertrude swap:  Gertrude has pink now, Bob has blue.
* Dave and Bob swap: Dave has blue, Bob has green.
* Eve and Gertrude swap: Eve has pink, Gertrude has yellow.
* Bob and Alice swap: Bob has orange, Alice has green.
* Eve and Fred swap: Eve has red, Fred has pink.
* Claire and Dave swap: Claire has blue, Dave has orange.
* Gertrude and Fred swap: Gertrude has red, Fred has yellow.

So at the end, Eve has the **red ball**. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

They keep trading balls back and forth.  It's kinda like a game of telephone, but with balls!  

* Claire and Dave swap: Claire gets Dave's ball, Dave gets Claire's.
* Fred and Eve swap: Fred gets Eve's ball, Eve gets Fred's.
* Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets Claire's ball, Claire gets Bob's.
* Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets Alice's ball, Alice gets Eve's.
* Eve and Gertrude swap: Eve gets Gertrude's ball, Gertrude gets Eve's.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's ball, Dave gets Bob's.
* Gertrude and Bob swap: Gertrude gets Bob's ball, Bob gets Gertrude's.

Now, at the end, Fred has the **white ball**. 


So the answer is (A). 





"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

* Fred starts with a brown present.
* He swaps with Eve, so now Fred has a red present.
* Then he swaps with Dave, so Fred has a blue present.
* Next, Fred swaps with Alice and gets a black present.

So at the end, Fred has the **(A) black ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Fred and Gertrude switch:  Gertrude is now with Rodrigo.
* Claire and Fred switch: Fred is with Claire, Gertrude is still with Rodrigo.
* Dave and Alice switch: Dave is with Alice, Alice is with Sam.
* Alice and Bob switch: Alice is with Bob, Bob is with Sam.
* Gertrude and Eve switch: Gertrude is with Izzi, Eve is with Rodrigo.
* Dave and Gertrude switch: Dave is with Izzi, Gertrude is with Rodrigo.
* Alice and Dave switch: Alice is with Izzi, Dave is with Rodrigo.

So at the end, Gertrude is dancing with Rodrigo! 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book!

It's like a big book swap party!

*  Alice starts with ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" but trades it around a bunch.
*  Bob starts with ""The Great Gatsby"" and also trades a lot.
*  Claire starts with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and trades with Fred.
*  Dave starts with ""Frankenstein"" and trades with Alice.
*  Eve starts with ""Ulysses"" and trades with Bob at the end.

So, at the end, Eve has **(G) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book.  

*  Alice starts with *The Great Gatsby* and swaps it a couple of times.
* Bob starts with *The Fellowship of the Ring* and swaps it at the end.
* Claire starts with *Ulysses* and swaps a lot!
* Dave starts with *The Odyssey* and swaps it around too.
* Eve starts with *Frankenstein* and swaps it a few times.
* Fred starts with *Hound of the Baskervilles* and swaps it a few times.
* Gertrude starts with *Moby Dick* and swaps it at the end.

If you follow all the swaps, you'll see that Dave ends up with **(D) Frankenstein**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a game of telephone, but with balls!  We just gotta keep track of who has which ball after each swap.

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Blue
    * Bob - Yellow
    * Claire - Pink
    * Dave - Black
    * Eve - White
    * Fred - Brown
    * Gertrude - Orange

    * Fred and Dave swap: Fred gets white, Dave gets black.
    * Claire and Dave swap: Claire gets black, Dave gets pink.
    * Bob and Eve swap: Bob gets white, Eve gets blue.

* **End:** Alice has the **black ball (D)**! 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

* Bob starts with white, then he swaps with Alice who has green.
* Claire has purple, she swaps with Dave who has red.
* Bob (now with green) swaps with Gertrude who has orange.
* Fred has yellow and swaps with Bob (who has orange).
* Claire (now with red) swaps with Eve who has blue.
* Alice (now with orange) swaps with Bob (who has yellow).
* Claire (now with yellow) swaps with Gertrude (who has blue).

Whew! That's a lot of swapping.  

So, in the end, Eve has the **(C) white present**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!

**Answer:** (E) 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It says Claire starts as the right winger. Then, she swaps with Bob, who was the cheerleader.  After that, they don't swap back, so Claire must still be the cheerleader at the end.


So the answer is **(A) cheerleader**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Bob and Gertrude trade, so Bob gets *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Gertrude gets *Catch-22*.

*  Bob starts on the bench, but he ends up in goal!

So the answer is **(A) goalkeeper**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  They keep trading balls back and forth.  

Let's see... Bob starts with white, then he trades with Gertrude, so now he has brown. Then he trades with Gertrude again and gets pink.  

It gets a little confusing, but if you keep track of who has which ball after each trade, you'll see that in the end, Eve has the white ball.

Let's see... Eve and Dave swap, then Gertrude and Eve swap, then Bob and Fred swap...  It gets a little confusing!  

But if we keep track of who has which ball after each swap, we can figure out who ends up with which ball.  

At the end, Alice has the **(D) orange ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.  

*  Alice starts as a left midfielder, but she switches around a lot.
* Bob starts in the middle, but then ends up as the striker.

So the answer is **(D) striker**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Gertrude starts with Melissa, then switches with Eve, then with Bob, then with Claire.
* Claire starts with Helga, then switches with Sam, then with Alice, then with Gertrude.

So, at the end, Claire is dancing with **(E) Izzi**. 



"
"Okay, so we have all these dancers switching partners.  Let's see...

* Alice starts with Lola, but then switches with Gertrude a few times.
* Dave starts with Rodrigo, but then switches with Lola and Eve.

* Eve starts with Izzi, but then switches with Bob, Dave, and Claire.
* Bob starts with Melissa, but then switches with Eve and Izzi.
* Claire starts with Patrick, but then switches with Eve.
* Gertrude starts with Sam, but switches with Alice, Dave, Fred, and then back to Sam.

So, at the end, Gertrude is dancing with **(B) Sam**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is trading presents.  We just have to keep track of who has what after each trade.

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Green
    * Bob - Blue
    * Claire - Red
    * Dave - Purple
    * Eve - Brown
    * Fred - White
    * Gertrude - Yellow

* **Trades:**

* **End:**
    * Alice - Green 


So the answer is **(F)**! 




"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

* Bob and Alice swap, then Dave and Fred swap, then Alice and Gertrude swap... it gets kinda confusing!

But, if we keep track of who has what after each swap, we can figure out what Fred ends up with.  

After all the swapping is done, Fred has the **(C) white present**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  Then they trade balls a bunch of times.  To figure out who ends up with which ball, we can just keep track of who has what after each trade.

It's a little tricky, but if you write it out, you'll see that in the end, Gertrude has the **(E) yellow ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!

Let's see... Claire and Gertrude swap, then Eve and Alice swap.  Then Claire and Gertrude swap again!  That's confusing.  

After all the swaps, Fred ends up with the **(C) black ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we know Fred starts with a white ball. Then he trades with Eve and gets her blue ball.  After that, he doesn't trade with anyone else.  

So Fred ends up with the blue ball!  

The answer is (E).

"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

*  Dave and Fred swap, then Bob and Fred swap, then Gertrude and Dave swap... it gets kinda confusing!

But, if we keep track of who has what, we can figure it out.  In the end, Gertrude has the **(G) yellow present**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to Fred's ball!

*  At the start, Fred has a yellow ball.
*  He trades with Bob, so now Fred has an orange ball.
*  Then he trades with Claire, and Fred gets a white ball.
*  He trades with Eve, and now Fred has a blue ball.
*  He trades with Claire again, and Fred ends up with a white ball.


So the answer is **(F)**.

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

They keep trading balls back and forth.  It's kinda like a game of telephone, but with balls!

* Gertrude starts with white, then gets blue, then white again.
* Eve starts with blue, then gets purple, then white, then blue again.

**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out where Alice ends up. 

*  She starts as a benchwarmer.
*  Then Bob and Alice switch, so Alice becomes a right winger.
*  Next, Dave and Eve switch, but that doesn't change Alice's position.
*  Gertrude and Eve switch, still no change for Alice.
*  Fred and Bob switch, and now Alice is back on the bench.
*  Claire and Fred switch, still no change for Alice.
*  Gertrude and Alice switch, so Alice becomes the striker.
*  Dave and Fred switch, and Alice stays a striker.

So the answer is **(A) striker**.

So the answer is **(D) brown present**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where people switch places during the soccer game.

* Alice and Bob switch.
* Bob and Fred switch.
* Fred and Eve switch.

After all those switches, Alice ends up dancing with **Bob**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with the orange ball.  

At the start, Claire has the orange ball. Then they swap with Eve, so Eve has the orange ball.  But then Claire swaps with Gertrude, so Claire gets the orange ball back!

So the answer is **(F)**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book!

*  First, Fred and Bob swap.  That means Fred gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Bob gets *The Great Gatsby*.
* Then Bob and Gertrude swap. Now Fred has *The Great Gatsby* and Gertrude has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* Next, Fred and Gertrude swap again.  Fred is back to having *Hound of the Baskervilles*!
*  Alice and Gertrude swap, then Alice and Gertrude swap again.  This is getting confusing!
* Finally, Dave and Eve swap.

So, at the end, Fred has **(C) Hound of the Baskervilles**.

* Fred: White
* Gertrude: Orange

Then they trade them around.  It gets a little confusing, but if we keep track, we can see where Dave ends up.

* Dave gets the white ball, then the yellow ball.

So at the end, Dave has the **(D) yellow ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  They keep trading balls back and forth.

*  Alice starts with Ulysses, but then trades it around a bunch.
*  Bob starts with Frankenstein, but trades it too.
*  Claire starts with Moby Dick, and... you get the idea.

It's kinda confusing keeping track of all the trades!  But if we follow them step-by-step, we can figure out who ends up with which book.

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.  

*  Alice starts as a left midfielder, but then she switches around a bunch.
*  Bob starts as a cheerleader, which is kinda funny 'cause cheerleaders don't usually play soccer!
*  Claire starts as a right winger, and she ends up being a cheerleader too.

It gets kinda confusing with all the swapping, but if we follow it step-by-step, we can figure out where Bob ends up.  

At the very end, Bob is playing **(A) right winger**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

* Dave trades his blue ball with Fred, so Dave has pink now.

"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  They keep trading balls back and forth.  

Let's see... Claire and Dave swap, then Fred and Eve swap, and so on.  It gets a little confusing, but if you keep track of who has which ball after each trade, you'll see that in the end, Gertrude ends up with the purple ball. 


So the answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  Let's see...

*  Then Dave and Claire switch, and then Bob and Fred switch.
*  Fred and Alice switch again, and then Gertrude and Fred switch.
*  Dave and Bob switch, and finally Claire and Eve switch.

If we keep track of it all, we'll see that in the end, Bob is playing **(G) fullback**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure out who has the ball at the end.  

It's like a game of telephone, but with balls!  We just gotta keep track of who gets which ball each time they swap.

* Claire starts with red, Bob starts with black. They swap, so Claire has black and Bob has red.
* Dave starts with pink, Claire swaps with him, so Dave has red and Claire has pink.
* Fred starts with blue, Gertrude starts with orange. They swap, so Fred has orange and Gertrude has blue.
* Fred swaps with Eve, so Fred has white and Eve has blue.
* Claire and Dave swap again, so Claire has pink and Dave has red.
* Alice starts with purple, Bob starts with black. They swap, so Alice has black and Bob has purple.
* Finally, Dave and Bob swap, so Dave has purple and Bob has black.

So, at the end, Fred has the **white ball**. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  They keep trading balls back and forth.  We just need to figure out what color ball Eve ends up with.

Let's see...

* Bob and Alice swap, then Alice and Dave swap, then Alice and Eve swap.  So now Eve has Alice's ball.
* Then Dave and Gertrude swap, but that doesn't affect Eve.
* Next, Alice and Claire swap, and then Fred and Bob swap.  Still, Eve keeps the ball she got from Alice.
* Finally, Alice and Gertrude swap.

Since Eve got Alice's ball early on, and Alice was holding the orange ball, Eve ends up with the **(G) orange ball**. 




"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It says Gertrude starts as a benchwarmer and then swaps with Alice.  After that, they don't swap back.  So Gertrude must still be a benchwarmer at the end.


The answer is **(G) benchwarmer**. 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color present Fred ends up with.  

Let's keep track of who has what present after each swap:

*  

It looks like Bob ends up with the **(C) pink ball**.

*  They keep switching, but Fred always ends up with Karl.

So the answer is **(G) Karl**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

*  Alice starts with *Lolita* but then trades it for *Catch-22*.
*  Bob starts with *Ulysses* and trades it for *The Odyssey*.
*  Claire starts with *Hound of the Baskervilles* and trades it for *The Great Gatsby*.

*  Gertrude starts with *The Odyssey* and trades it for *Ulysses*.

So at the end, Gertrude has **(F) The Odyssey**. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

*  At the start, Claire has the yellow present.
*  Then they swap a bunch of times.  
*  After all the swaps, Claire ends up with the orange present.


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book!

It's like a big book swap party!  

* At first, everyone has a different book.
* Then they trade back and forth.  It gets kinda confusing, but if we keep track, we can figure it out!

After all the trading, Gertrude ends up with **(E) The Odyssey**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what ball!

* Fred and Bob swap:  Fred gets the red ball, Bob gets the yellow ball.
* Eve and Fred swap: Eve gets the yellow ball, Fred gets the pink ball.
* Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets the yellow ball, Eve gets the pink ball.
* Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets the yellow ball, Bob gets the blue ball.
* Dave and Fred swap: Dave gets the pink ball, Fred gets the blue ball.

* Gertrude and Alice swap: Gertrude gets the yellow ball, Alice gets the brown ball.

So, in the end, Alice has the **(C) brown ball**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.

*  Bob starts as left midfielder, then he switches around a bunch.
*  Dave starts as goalkeeper, but he moves to other spots too.

After all the switching, Dave ends up as the **center midfielder**. 


So the answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color ball Bob has at the end.  Let's see...

* Bob starts with a black ball.
* He swaps with Alice, so now he has a blue present.
* Then he swaps with Alice again and gets the black ball back.
* Next, he swaps with Fred and gets the orange ball.

So at the end, Bob has the **orange ball**.


**Answer:** (A) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Fred and Gertrude switch: Gertrude is now with Fred.
* Dave and Claire switch: Dave is now with Claire.
* Dave and Bob switch: Dave is now with Bob.
* Bob and Claire switch: Bob is now with Claire.
* Alice and Gertrude switch: Alice is now with Gertrude.
* Dave and Alice switch: Dave is now with Alice.
* Eve and Gertrude switch: Eve is now with Gertrude.

So at the end, Gertrude is dancing with **Alice**. 


**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places.  We just gotta keep track of who's where.

*  At the start, Dave is the right midfielder.
*  Then they swap positions a bunch of times.
*  But in the end, Dave ends up as the right winger.


So the answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a game of telephone, but with presents!  We just gotta keep track of who has what after each swap.

* **Start:**
    * Alice - White
    * Bob - Yellow
    * Claire - Red
    * Dave - Black
    * Eve - Pink
    * Fred - Orange
    * Gertrude - Purple

* **Swaps:**

After all the swaps, Alice ends up with the **(D) black ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we have all these dancers switching partners.  Let's see...

* Alice starts with Lola, then switches with Eve, then with Claire, and ends up with Helga.
* Bob starts with Melissa and then switches with Dave and ends up with Patrick.
* Dave starts with Karl, then switches with Fred, then with Gertrude, then with Melissa.

So at the end, Dave is dancing with **(F) Melissa**. 


"
"Okay, so we have all these dancers switching partners.  Let's see...

* Claire and Eve swap partners.
* Then Alice and Fred swap.
* Next, Gertrude and Dave swap.
* Eve and Bob swap.
* Eve and Fred swap again.
* Bob and Claire swap.
* Finally, Fred and Gertrude swap.

Whew! That's a lot of switching.  

At the end, Bob is dancing with **(C) Claire**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which ball!

* Bob starts with white and trades with Gertrude for brown.
* Fred starts with black and trades with Claire for yellow.
* Dave starts with pink and trades with Gertrude for brown.
* Bob trades his pink ball back to Gertrude for white.
* Alice starts with green and trades with Claire for black.
* Gertrude trades her brown ball with Claire for green.
* Eve starts with orange and trades with Claire for white.

So, in the end, Gertrude has the **green ball**. 


**Answer:** (D) 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out where Fred ends up after all those position swaps.  Let's keep track:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Bench
    * Bob: Right Wing
    * Claire: Fullback
    * Dave: Cheer
    * Eve: Left Mid
    * Fred: Left Wing
    * Gertrude: Striker

* **Swaps:**  It gets kinda confusing, but we just gotta follow who switches with who!

After all the swaps, Fred ends up as the **fullback (A)**. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  They keep trading balls back and forth.  

Let's see... Claire and Bob swap, then Alice and Gertrude swap.  Hmm, it gets a little confusing after that!  But if we keep track of who has which ball, we can figure it out.

After all the swaps, Bob ends up with the **orange ball**. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places during the soccer game.  

*  Bob starts as the goalie.
*  Then Gertrude and Eve switch, then Gertrude and Alice switch, and so on.

We gotta keep track of who's where after each swap. It's a bit tricky, but if we do it step-by-step, we can find out where Bob ends up.

After all the switching, Bob ends up playing **(B) left winger**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

* Alice starts with blue, but then she swaps with Fred, so she has brown.
* Claire starts with red, but then she swaps with Bob, so she has yellow.
* Dave starts with black, but then he swaps with Fred, so he has blue.
* Eve starts with white, but then she swaps with Alice, so she has blue.
* Bob starts with yellow, but then he swaps with Alice, so he has white.
* Eve swaps with Gertrude, so Gertrude has white.

So at the end, Gertrude has the **(A) white present**. 



"
"Okay, so we have all these dancers switching partners.  Let's see...

* Claire and Fred switch:  That means Fred is now dancing with Sam.
* Then Claire switches with Dave, then Alice and Bob switch, then Claire and Eve switch, then Dave and Claire switch again, then Gertrude and Eve switch, and finally Bob and Eve switch.

But none of those switches change who Fred is dancing with. 

So Fred is still dancing with **Sam**. 


**The answer is (G).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Eve and Claire swap, then Dave and Fred swap, then Alice and Claire swap again.
* Gertrude and Eve swap, then Alice and Bob swap, then Dave and Eve swap one more time.
* Finally, Fred and Gertrude swap.

After all those swaps, Gertrude ends up dancing with Rodrigo. 

So the answer is **(F)**.

* Gertrude starts with Helga, then switches with Fred, then with Alice.
*  

At the end, Gertrude is dancing with **(B) Jamie**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Alice starts with Melissa, but then she switches with Fred, then with Bob, then with Fred again, then with Alice again.  Whew!
* Gertrude starts with Izzi, then switches with Eve, then with Alice.
* Bob starts with Ophelia, then switches with Alice.
* Dave starts with Jamie, then switches with Fred.
* Eve starts with Lola, then switches with Gertrude, then with Alice, then with Claire.

At the end, Eve is dancing with **(G) Patrick**.

"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Gertrude and Fred switch, so Fred has Moby Dick and Gertrude has Hound of the Baskervilles.
* Alice and Claire switch, so Alice has The Odyssey and Claire has Ulysses.
* Bob and Dave switch, so Bob has Catch-22 and Dave has The Great Gatsby.
* Claire and Dave switch again, so Claire has The Great Gatsby and Dave has Ulysses.

* Finally, Eve and Alice switch, so Eve has Ulysses and Alice has Lolita.

So at the end, Dave has **(G) The Great Gatsby**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a game of telephone, but with balls!  We need to keep track of who has which ball after each swap.

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Pink
    * Bob - White
    * Claire - Brown
    * Dave - Blue
    * Eve - Yellow
    * Fred - Black
    * Gertrude - Purple

* **Swaps:**
    * Fred & Gertrude swap: Fred gets purple, Gertrude gets black.

    * Claire & Eve swap: Claire gets blue, Eve gets yellow.

* **End:** Dave is holding the **black ball**.


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Alice starts with Lola, but then switches with Eve.
* Dave starts with Karl, but switches around a lot!
* Eve starts with Sam, but ends up with Karl.

...and so on.

If you keep track of who's with who after each switch, you'll see that Gertrude ends up dancing with **(E) Patrick**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Eve starts with Patrick.
* She switches with Claire, then with Bob, then with Alice, then with Dave, and finally with Dave again. 

That means Eve ends up with Dave's original partner, which is **Rodrigo**. 


So the answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

They start with different colored balls, and then they keep trading them back and forth.  

* Dave and Alice swap: Dave gets pink, Alice gets green.
* Alice and Fred swap: Alice gets black, Fred gets pink.
* Fred and Dave swap: Dave gets pink, Fred gets green.
* Eve and Bob swap: Eve gets orange, Bob gets blue.
* Claire and Fred swap: Claire gets green, Fred gets white.
* Bob and Gertrude swap: Bob gets yellow, Gertrude gets orange.
* Gertrude and Alice swap: Gertrude gets pink, Alice gets yellow.

So, at the end, Claire has the **green ball**.


**Answer:** (C) green ball. 




"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Gertrude starts with Moby Dick.
* She trades with Bob, so now she has Hound of the Baskervilles.
*  The rest of the trades don't change who has Hound of the Baskervilles.

So the answer is **(G) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they're all swapping presents!  It's kinda like a game of telephone, but with gifts.  

Let's see...

* Eve and Fred swap: Eve gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Eve's.
* Dave and Bob swap: Dave gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Dave's.
* Claire and Gertrude swap: Claire gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Claire's.
* Fred and Claire swap: Fred gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Fred's.

* Gertrude and Alice swap: Gertrude gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Gertrude's.
* Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Bob's.

Whew! That's a lot of swapping.  

Now, to figure out what Dave has at the end, we just have to look back at all the swaps.  Dave started with the yellow present, and he swapped with Bob, who had the green present.  So, Dave must have the **(F) green present** at the end. 




"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* At the start, Fred has *The Pearl*.
* Then they swap a bunch of times!  It gets kinda confusing, but if we keep track, we'll figure it out.

Let's just focus on Fred's book:

* Fred swaps *The Pearl* with Dave.
* Then Fred swaps with Alice.
* Then Fred swaps with Alice again!

So, Fred ends up with **(B) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 



"
"Okay, so Gertrude starts as the cheerleader. Then she switches with Claire to become the left winger.  After that, she doesn't switch again.  Finally, she trades places with Dave and becomes a benchwarmer. 

So the answer is **(F) benchwarmer**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book.  

*  Alice starts with Catch-22, but then trades it a bunch of times.
*  Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring and trades it too.
*  Claire starts with Lolita, and she ends up with Catch-22.

So the answer is **(C) Catch-22**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.  

*  At the start, Eve is on the left wing.
*  Then Dave and Eve switch, so Eve is a fullback.
*  Then Eve and Alice switch, so Eve is a right midfielder now!

So the answer is **(A) right midfielder**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places.  We just gotta keep track of who's where.

*  Alice starts as a right winger, but then she switches around a bunch.
*  Bob starts in the middle, but he moves to fullback and then back again.
*  Claire starts as a fullback, but she ends up in the middle.

It's kinda confusing, but if we keep going step-by-step, we'll find out where Eve ends up.

After all the switching, Eve is playing **(B) center midfielder**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which ball.  

*  At the start, Eve has the blue ball.
*  She swaps with Gertrude, so now Eve has the black ball.
*  Then she swaps with Fred, so now Eve has the white ball.

So the answer is **(E) white ball**. 


"

* Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob gets Catch-22.

So, in the end, Dave has **(B) Moby Dick**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  Here's what I got:

* Gertrude and Alice switch: Gertrude is with Melissa, Alice is with Ophelia.

* Claire and Dave swap: Claire gets Catch-22, Dave gets The Odyssey.
* Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets Ulysses, Alice gets Lolita.

So at the end, Alice has **(C) Lolita**. 



"
"Okay, so we know everyone starts with a different colored ball.  

Let's see what happens when they trade:

* Claire and Bob swap:  Claire gets the green ball, Bob gets the yellow ball.
* Alice and Gertrude swap: Alice gets the purple ball, Gertrude gets the blue ball.
* Claire and Dave swap: Claire gets the black ball, Dave gets the yellow ball.
* Dave and Gertrude swap: Dave gets the purple ball, Gertrude gets the black ball.
* Eve and Fred swap: Eve gets the orange ball, Fred gets the red ball.

* Gertrude and Claire swap: Gertrude gets the yellow ball, Claire gets the black ball.

So at the end, Fred has the **(B) red ball**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book.  

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Frankenstein
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: The Great Gatsby
    * Dave: The Odyssey
    * Eve: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Fred: Catch-22
    * Gertrude: Moby Dick

* **Swaps:**

It gets a little confusing with all the swaps, but let's just go step-by-step:

1. Claire and Gertrude swap.
2. Fred and Dave swap.
3. Bob and Alice swap.
4. Eve and Gertrude swap.
5. Dave and Bob swap.
6. Fred and Eve swap.
7. Bob and Fred swap.

* **The End:**

After all those swaps, Eve ends up with **The Odyssey**. 


**So the answer is (D).** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

They keep trading balls back and forth.  It's kinda like a game of telephone, but with balls!  

* Dave starts with orange, then gets purple.
* Alice starts with blue, then gets white.
* Gertrude starts with white, then gets black, then white again.
* Claire starts with green, then gets white, then pink.
* Eve starts with black, then gets white, then green, then pink, then white again.
* Fred starts with pink, then gets green, then purple.

So at the end, Fred has the **purple ball**. 


**Answer:** (G)

"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a different colored ball. They keep trading them back and forth.  

Let's see...

* Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Claire's black ball.

At the end, Alice has the **red ball**.


**Answer:** (B) 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

They keep swapping balls, so we need to keep track of who has what.  

* Fred starts with pink, then swaps with Alice who has blue. So Fred has blue now.
* Claire starts with brown, then swaps with Gertrude who has green. So Claire has green now.
* Bob starts with red, then swaps with Dave who has purple. So Bob has purple now.
* Eve starts with black, then swaps with Alice who has blue. So Eve has blue now.

So at the end, Alice is dancing with **(E) Jamie**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  Then they trade balls a bunch of times.  

Let's keep track of who has which ball after each trade:

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Yellow
    * Bob - Brown
    * Claire - Blue
    * Dave - Black

So at the end, Eve has the **(G) blue ball**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places.  

*  First, Eve and Claire switch.
*  Then Claire and Dave switch.
*  Then Dave and Bob switch.
*  Then Fred and Gertrude switch.
*  Then Bob and Claire switch again.

*  Alice starts as a striker, but then she ends up as the goalkeeper. 

So the answer is **(C)**.

So the answer is **(A) red ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners. 

* Gertrude and Eve switch:  Gertrude is with Rodrigo, Eve is with Jamie.

*  Bob is the striker at the beginning.
*  Claire starts on the bench.
*  Dave is in the middle.
*  Eve is cheering.
*  Fred is on the left wing.

So the answer is **(D)**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places.  We just gotta keep track of who's where.

*  At the start, Claire is the striker.
*  Then they swap a bunch of times.  
*  But in the end, Claire ends up as the left winger.


So the answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book!

It's like a big book swap party!

*  Alice starts with ""The Pearl"".
*  Bob starts with ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
*  Claire starts with ""The Odyssey"".
*  Dave starts with ""The Great Gatsby"".
*  Eve starts with ""Frankenstein"".

Then they swap!  It gets kinda confusing, but if we keep track, we'll figure it out.

After all the swapping, Alice ends up with **(G) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Eve and Dave switch:  Now Eve is with Dave, and Dave is with Rodrigo.

* Bob and Dave switch:  Hmm, I'll just remember that for now.
* Eve and Alice switch: Eve is with Alice, Alice is with Karl.

* Bob and Dave switch again:  So, Bob and Dave are back to their original partners.

That means Dave is dancing with **Sam** at the end. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Dave and Gertrude switch:  Now Dave is with Helga and Gertrude is with Dave.

* Eve and Alice switch: Now Eve is with Alice and Alice is with Sam.

So at the end, Gertrude is dancing with **(B) Helga**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people swapping presents, and each present is a different color.  It's like a puzzle!

Let's see... Bob starts with a black ball, and he swaps with Alice who has a white present. Then Dave and Fred swap, and so on.  

After all the swaps are done, Bob ends up with the **(D) brown present**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who Gertrude is dancing with at the end.

Gertrude is dancing with **(E) Patrick** at the end. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

* Alice starts with white, but then swaps with Eve who has pink.
* Eve then swaps with Fred who has orange.
* Alice swaps with Bob who has yellow.
* Claire swaps with Dave who has red.
* Eve swaps with Claire who has orange.
* Bob swaps with Gertrude who has purple.
* Eve swaps with Alice who has yellow.

Whew, that's a lot of swapping!  

At the end, Dave has the **(E) red present**. 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color ball Fred has at the end.  

Let's see:

*  Eve and Dave swap: This doesn't change Fred's ball.
*  Gertrude and Eve swap: This also doesn't change Fred's ball.
*  Bob and Fred swap: Fred now has a brown ball.
*  Claire and Fred swap: Fred now has an orange ball.
*  Alice and Claire swap: This doesn't change Fred's ball.
*  Eve and Fred swap: Fred now has a blue ball.
*  Eve and Dave swap: This doesn't change Fred's ball.


So the answer is **(A) blue ball**. 




"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.  

*  Alice starts as striker, but then she switches around a lot.
*  Bob starts as cheerleader, but ends up as fullback.

So the answer is **(B) fullback**.

So the answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It says Fred starts as the goalkeeper. Then he swaps with Eve, then with Bob, then with Gertrude, then with Alice, and finally with Bob again.  

* Fred starts as goalkeeper.
* He swaps with Eve, so he's fullback.
* He swaps with Bob, so he's right winger.
* He swaps with Gertrude, so he's cheerleader.

Fred ends up as the **(G) cheerleader**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.  

*  Alice starts as a left midfielder, but then she switches around a bunch.
*  Bob starts as a cheerleader, which is kinda different!
*  Claire starts on the right wing, and Dave is on the right midfield.

It gets kinda confusing with all the swapping, but if we follow it step-by-step, we can find out where Alice ends up.  

In the end, Alice is playing **(A) right winger**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Fred starts with Catch-22.
* He trades with Eve, so now Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles.
* Then he trades with Alice and gets Lolita.

So the answer is **(C) Lolita**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a game of telephone, but with presents!  We gotta keep track of who has what after each swap.

* Bob starts with white, Eve starts with red. They swap, so now Bob has red and Eve has white.
* Claire has pink, Gertrude has orange. They swap, so Claire has orange and Gertrude has pink.
* Gertrude has orange, Dave has black. They swap, so Gertrude has black and Dave has orange.
* Eve has red, Fred has brown. They swap, so Eve has brown and Fred has red.
* Fred has brown, Bob has white. They swap, so Fred has white and Bob has brown.
* Claire has orange, Alice has yellow. They swap, so Claire has yellow and Alice has orange.
* Fred has white, Bob has brown. They swap, so Fred has brown and Bob has white.

So in the end, Bob has the **(D) brown present**. 




"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a game of telephone, but with presents!  We just gotta keep track of who has what after each swap.

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Purple
    * Bob - Brown
    * Claire - Red
    * Dave - Green

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Alice starts with Lola, then switches with Sam, then Karl.
* Bob starts with Melissa, then switches with Patrick, then back to Melissa.
* Claire starts with Helga, then switches with Lola, then Sam.
* Dave starts with Karl, then switches with Izzi, then Patrick, then Melissa.
* Eve starts with Sam, then switches with Lola, then Helga, then Karl.
* Fred starts with Izzi, then switches with Karl, then back to Izzi.
* Gertrude starts with Patrick, then switches with Karl, then Helga.

So at the end, Alice is dancing with **(C) Karl**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to each person's book!

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Catch-22
    * Bob: The Pearl
    * Claire: Lolita
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: The Odyssey
    * Fred: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Gertrude: Hound of the Baskervilles

* **Swaps:**

They swap books a bunch of times!  It gets a little confusing, but let's just follow along.  

After all the swaps, Gertrude ends up with **(B) The Odyssey**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people swapping presents, and each present is a different color.  It's like a puzzle!

* Finally, Gertrude swaps with Dave who has white.

So, at the end, Fred has the **black ball**. 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  Then they trade balls a bunch of times.  To figure out who has which ball at the end, we can just keep track of who traded with who.

Let's see... Eve and Dave swap, then Claire and Eve swap, then Dave and Claire swap again.  That means Claire ends up with a white ball! 


So the answer is **(C) white ball**. 
"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

*  First, Fred and Eve swap.
*  Then Bob and Dave swap.

**Answer:** (F) 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where we keep switching people's soccer positions.  

*  Alice starts as a left winger, but then she switches around a bunch.
*  Bob starts as a fullback, but he ends up in a few different spots.
*  Gertrude starts as a left midfielder.

We have to keep track of all the swaps to see where Gertrude ends up.  

After all the switching, Gertrude is playing **(G) fullback**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places.  

*  Alice starts as a midfielder, but then she switches with Claire, who was on the wing.
*  Then Gertrude, who was on the bench, switches with Bob, the striker.
*  It keeps going like that, with people swapping back and forth.

After all the switching, Claire ends up playing **(G) right winger**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  They keep trading balls back and forth.  

Let's see...

* Alice starts with yellow and trades with Fred, then Bob, then Eve.
* Bob starts with red and trades with Dave, then Alice.
* Claire starts with black and trades with Fred, then Gertrude.
* Dave starts with white and trades with Bob, then...
* Eve starts with blue and trades with Alice.

It's a little confusing, but if we keep track of who has which ball after each trade, we can figure out who ends up with which ball.  

At the end, Eve has the **(G) yellow ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where we keep switching people's soccer positions.  

*  First, Alice and Gertrude switch.
*  Then Dave and Claire switch.
*  Next, Bob and Fred switch.
*  Then Fred and Alice switch again.
*  After that, Gertrude and Fred switch.
*  Then Dave and Bob switch.
*  Finally, Claire and Eve switch.

If we keep track of where everyone ends up, we'll find out where Fred is at the end.  

Let me see... after all those swaps, Fred is playing **(G) left winger**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Fred and Dave trade, then Eve and Fred trade, then Gertrude and Bob trade... it's like a book circle!

*  After all the trading, Gertrude ends up with **(G) The Great Gatsby**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.  

*  At the start, Eve is the left midfielder.
*  Then they swap a bunch of people around. 
*  But in the end, Eve ends up as the striker!

So the answer is **(F)**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Eve and Claire swap, then Dave and Fred swap, then Alice and Claire swap again.
* Gertrude and Eve swap, then Alice and Bob swap, then Dave and Eve swap one more time.
* Finally, Fred and Gertrude swap.

After all that switching, Fred ends up dancing with Karl.


So the answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Bob starts with Melissa, then switches with Fred, then with Helga, then with Lola.
* Fred starts with Helga, then switches with Melissa, then with Lola.

So at the end, Fred is dancing with **(C) Lola**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what ball!

* Gertrude and Bob swap: Gertrude gets pink, Bob gets red.
* Dave and Bob swap: Dave gets pink, Bob gets black.
* Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets brown, Claire gets pink.
* Dave and Fred swap: Dave gets orange, Fred gets black.
* Gertrude and Dave swap: Gertrude gets orange, Dave gets red.

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Gertrude and Alice swap, then Dave and Claire swap, then Bob and Claire swap again. 
* Gertrude and Eve swap, then Claire and Fred swap, and finally Fred and Alice swap. 
* Oh, and Gertrude and Dave swap partners at the very end.

After all those swaps, Alice ends up dancing with **Rodrigo (D)**. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  Then they trade balls a bunch of times.  To figure out who has which ball at the end, we can just keep track of who traded with who.

Let's see...

* Fred and Eve swap: Fred gets blue, Eve gets red.
* Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets orange, Bob gets yellow.
* Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets yellow, Bob gets blue.
* Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets white, Alice gets red.
* Bob and Gertrude swap: Bob gets green, Gertrude gets blue.
* Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets orange, Claire gets yellow.
* Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets white, Eve gets blue.

So at the end, Claire has the **(D) yellow ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a game of telephone, but with presents!  We gotta keep track of who has what after each swap.

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Blue
    * Bob: White
    * Claire: Purple
    * Dave: Black
    * Eve: Brown
    * Fred: Orange
    * Gertrude: Yellow

    * Claire: Blue
    * Dave: Black
    * Eve: Brown
    * Fred: Orange
    * Gertrude: Yellow

So, at the end, Eve has the **(A) brown present**. 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Claire and Eve swap, then Gertrude and Alice swap, then Bob and Alice swap... it gets kinda confusing!

But if we keep track, we'll find out who Bob is dancing with at the end.  

After all the switching, Bob ends up dancing with **(G) Izzi**. 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color present Eve ends up with.  Let's see...

* Fred and Alice swap: Fred gets yellow, Alice gets pink.

So, in the end, Eve has the **blue present**.


**Answer:** (G) 
"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Bob and Gertrude trade, so Bob gets *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Gertrude gets *Catch-22*.
* Eve and Dave trade, so Eve gets *Moby Dick* and Dave gets *Lolita*.
* Alice and Gertrude trade, so Alice gets *Catch-22* and Gertrude gets *The Great Gatsby*.
* Eve and Alice trade, so Eve gets *The Great Gatsby* and Alice gets *Lolita*.
* Fred and Eve trade, so Fred gets *Lolita* and Eve gets *The Pearl*.
* Alice and Bob trade, so Alice gets *Catch-22* and Bob gets *The Great Gatsby*.
* Claire and Alice trade, so Claire gets *Catch-22* and Alice gets *Ulysses*.

At the end, Dave has **(F) Lolita**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which ball!

* Fred and Alice swap: Fred gets the blue ball, Alice gets the pink ball.
* Claire and Gertrude swap: Claire gets the green ball, Gertrude gets the brown ball.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets the purple ball, Dave gets the red ball.

* Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets the purple ball, Bob gets the red ball.

At the end, Claire has the **purple ball**.


So the answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to each person's ball:

* Gertrude starts with blue and trades with Alice.
* Fred starts with green and trades with Bob, then with Claire.
* Eve starts with brown and trades with Dave.
* Alice starts with purple and trades with Gertrude, Eve, and Claire.
* Claire starts with orange and trades with Fred, Alice, and Fred again.

At the end, Claire has the **(D) green ball**.

"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Fred and Bob swap, then Eve and Alice swap, then Fred and Eve swap again.  
* Claire and Fred swap, then Gertrude and Alice swap, then Alice and Bob swap one more time.
* Finally, Dave and Fred swap.

After all those swaps, Alice ends up dancing with **Ophelia (G)**. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  Let's see where Bob ends up.

* Gertrude and Eve swap: Gertrude gets brown, Eve gets yellow.
* Gertrude and Bob swap: Gertrude gets blue, Bob gets yellow.
* Gertrude and Fred swap: Gertrude gets white, Fred gets yellow.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets purple, Dave gets yellow.

**Answer: (F)** 
"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Alice and Bob swap, then Gertrude and Claire swap, then Dave and Gertrude swap... it's like a book chain!

*  After all the swapping, Gertrude ends up with **(A) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.  

*  Alice starts as a left midfielder, but then she switches around a bunch.
*  Bob starts as a striker, but then he ends up as a fullback.
*  Fred starts as a left winger.

See, it's all about who switched with who!  

In the end, Fred is playing **(B) center midfielder**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.

So, Gertrude ends up with **Catch-22**. 

The answer is **(F)**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

*  At the start, Gertrude has *Moby Dick*.
*  She swaps with Claire, so now Gertrude has *The Great Gatsby*.
*  Then she swaps with Eve, so now Gertrude has *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

Gertrude ends up with **(E) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

* Alice starts with blue, but then swaps with Fred who has brown.
* Claire has red, but then swaps with Bob who has yellow.
* Dave has a black ball, and swaps with Fred who now has the black ball.
* Eve has white, and swaps with Alice who now has white.
* Bob and Alice swap again, so Bob has white now.
* Eve swaps with Gertrude, so Eve has orange.
* Finally, Fred and Alice swap one last time, so Fred ends up with the white present.



So the answer is **(F)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book.

They start with these colors:

* Alice: White
* Bob: Orange
* Claire: Yellow
* Dave: Black
* Eve: Blue
* Fred: Red
* Gertrude: Green

* Claire and Bob swap: Claire has orange, Bob has yellow.
* Fred and Bob swap: Fred has yellow, Bob has red.
* Eve and Alice swap: Eve has white, Alice has red.

So at the end, Alice has the **red ball**. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places.  

*  Gertrude and Bob switch, then Eve and Alice switch, then Gertrude and Dave switch... and so on.

If you keep track of who's where after each switch, you'll see where Fred ends up. It takes a little time, but you can do it! 


Let me know if you want me to walk through all the switches step-by-step. 

"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  They keep trading balls back and forth.  

Let's see...

* Alice and Fred swap.
* Dave and Fred swap.
* Eve and Gertrude swap.
* Dave and Claire swap.
* Claire and Bob swap.
* Dave and Alice swap.
* Bob and Fred swap.

After all those swaps, Dave ends up with the **(C) orange ball**.

* Then she trades with Bob and gets Lolita.

So the answer is **(F) Lolita**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where people switch places during the soccer game.  

*  Alice starts as striker, but then she switches around a lot.
*  Claire starts as fullback.

We need to see where Claire ends up.  Let's look at the last swap: Fred and Alice switch.

That means Claire is still the **(D) left winger**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Dave starts with Patrick.
* Then Dave switches with Bob, so Dave is with Helga.
*  The rest of the switching doesn't matter because we only care about who Dave is with at the end.

So the answer is **(A) Helga**. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  Then they trade balls a bunch of times.  

Let's keep track of who has which ball after each trade:

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a game of telephone, but with presents!  We need to keep track of who has what after each swap.

* **Start:**
    * Alice - White
    * Bob - Yellow
    * Claire - Red
    * Dave - Black

* Then she trades with Alice and gets Lolita.
*  She doesn't trade after that, so she ends up with **(B) Catch-22**. 




"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places.  We just gotta keep track of who's where.

*  Alice starts as a left winger.
*  Bob is the cheerleader.
*  Claire is in the middle.
*  Dave is a fullback.
*  Eve is the striker.
*  Fred is on the left side.

After all the swapping, Eve is playing **(B) center midfielder**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.  

* Alice starts as a left midfielder.

"
"Okay, so let's figure out what color ball Alice has at the end.  

It's like a puzzle where we keep swapping balls between people.  

* First, Alice trades with Eve, so Alice gets Eve's ball (yellow).
* Then Alice trades with Gertrude, so Alice gets Gertrude's ball (purple).
*  And then Gertrude trades with Claire, so Alice keeps the purple ball.

So at the end, Alice has the **(C) purple ball**.

"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  

Let's see...

* Gertrude and Dave swap, then Fred and Eve swap, then Bob and Fred swap, then Alice and Dave swap, then Claire and Alice swap, then Claire and Fred swap, and finally Alice and Eve swap.

After all those swaps, Dave ends up with the **(F) pink ball**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone switches places.  We just gotta keep track of who's where.

*  At the start, Fred is on the right wing.
*  Then they swap a bunch!  
*  But the important thing is, Fred keeps switching spots with Claire.

So, at the end, Fred is playing **(E) left midfielder**. 



"
"Okay, so we have all these dancers switching partners.  Let's see...

* Fred and Claire switch:  That means Fred is with Melissa and Claire is with Patrick.
* Alice and Bob switch: Now Alice is with Karl and Bob is with Helga.
* Dave and Eve switch: Dave is with Jamie and Eve is with Izzi.
* Gertrude and Fred switch: Gertrude is with Patrick and Fred is with Rodrigo.
* Alice and Bob switch again: Alice is with Helga and Bob is with Karl.
* Alice and Fred switch: Alice is with Rodrigo and Fred is with Helga.
* Fred and Claire switch again: Fred is with Patrick and Claire is with Helga.

So at the end, Bob is dancing with **Karl (B)**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Bob starts with Rodrigo.
* Then he switches with Fred, so Bob is with Karl.
*  He switches again with Claire, so Bob is with Dave.

So the answer is **(F)**! 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Alice starts with Catch-22 and trades it with Bob for Moby Dick.
* Claire starts with The Great Gatsby and trades it a couple of times, but in the end, she has The Odyssey.
* Dave starts with The Odyssey and trades it around a bit, but he ends up with The Great Gatsby.
* Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring and trades it a bunch, but she ends up with Frankenstein.
* Fred starts with Frankenstein and trades it a couple of times, but he ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* Gertrude starts with Lolita and trades it with Fred, so she ends up with Frankenstein.

So, Alice ends up with **(E) Moby Dick**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Alice starts with Lola, but then switches with Gertrude.
* Dave starts with Rodrigo, but then switches with Gertrude a couple of times.
* Fred starts with Ophelia, but then switches with Gertrude.
* Eve starts with Izzi, but then switches with Bob.

It gets a little confusing, but if you keep track of who's with who, you'll see that in the end, Dave is dancing with Melissa. 


So the answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  Let's see where Bob ends up.

* Gertrude and Dave swap: Gertrude gets blue, Dave gets brown.
* Claire and Dave swap: Claire gets blue, Dave gets black.
* Eve and Claire swap: Eve gets black, Claire gets purple.
* Dave and Alice swap: Dave gets red, Alice gets blue.
* Alice and Gertrude swap: Alice gets brown, Gertrude gets red.
* Gertrude and Eve swap: Gertrude gets purple, Eve gets brown.
* Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets yellow, Bob gets white.

At the end, Bob has the **(G) white present**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

* Gertrude and Alice swap: Gertrude gets The Odyssey, Alice gets Lolita.
* Bob and Fred swap: Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Fred gets Frankenstein.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Moby Dick, Dave gets Frankenstein.
* Bob and Alice swap: Bob gets Lolita, Alice gets Moby Dick.
* Claire and Alice swap: Claire gets Moby Dick, Alice gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
* Claire and Fred swap: Claire gets Frankenstein, Fred gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
* Eve and Dave swap: Eve gets Frankenstein, Dave gets The Pearl.

At the end, Bob has **(A) Moby Dick**. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball. They keep trading balls back and forth.  

Let's see... Claire and Dave swap, then Eve and Alice swap, then Gertrude and Eve swap...  It gets a little confusing, but if you keep track of who has which ball after each swap, you'll see that in the end, Fred ends up with the pink ball. 


So the answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book!

*  Alice starts with *Lolita*.
*  Bob starts with *The Great Gatsby*.
*  Claire starts with *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
*  Dave starts with *Catch-22*.
*  Eve starts with *The Odyssey*.
*  Fred starts with *Moby Dick*.
*  Gertrude starts with *Ulysses*.

Then they start trading:

* Eve and Gertrude swap.
* Bob and Eve swap.
* Alice and Gertrude swap.
* Claire and Eve swap.
* Eve and Alice swap.
* Fred and Alice swap.
* Eve and Dave swap.

After all those swaps, Alice ends up with **(G) Moby Dick**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta keep track of who's where.  

*  Gertrude starts as a cheerleader, but then she switches with Eve who was on the bench.
*  Then Eve becomes a center midfielder, and Bob, who was in the middle, becomes a cheerleader.
*  Next, Bob switches with Dave, who was a fullback.
*  Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude is now a left midfielder.
*  Eve and Bob switch again, so Eve is a fullback.
*  Eve and Alice swap, so Eve is a left winger.
*  Finally, Fred and Bob swap, so Fred is now in the middle.


So the answer is **(F) center midfielder**. 




"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a present of a different color. They keep swapping presents!  Let's see where Alice ends up.

*  Eve and Claire swap:  Eve gets brown, Claire gets orange.
*  Fred and Claire swap: Fred gets brown, Claire gets pink.
*  Dave and Bob swap: Dave gets green, Bob gets purple.
*  Alice and Claire swap: Alice gets pink, Claire gets blue.
*  Dave and Alice swap: Dave gets pink, Alice gets blue.

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

They start with different colored balls, and then they swap them around.  It's like a puzzle!

* Alice and Eve swap, then Dave and Fred swap, and so on.

Let's keep track of who has which ball after each swap:

* **Start:**
    * Alice - Purple
    * Bob - Brown
    * Claire - Blue
    * Dave - Pink
    * Eve - Yellow
    * Fred - White
    * Gertrude - Black

    * Alice - Purple
    * Bob - Black
    * Claire - **Black**
    * Dave - Pink
    * Eve - Yellow
    * Fred - Brown
    * Gertrude - Blue

So at the end, Claire has the **black ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we have seven people and each has a different colored ball. They keep trading balls back and forth.

So the answer is (A). 
"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  Then they trade balls a bunch of times.  

Let's keep track of who has which ball after each trade:

* **Start:**
    * Alice - White
    * Bob - Black
    * Claire - Pink
    * Dave - Orange
    * Eve - Purple

    * Dave - Black
    * Eve - Orange
    * Fred - Brown
    * Gertrude - White



So at the end, Claire has the **green ball**. 


"
"Okay, so let's see what happens to Dave.  

* Fred and Eve switch, then Eve and Claire switch, then Gertrude and Alice switch. That doesn't change Dave's position.
* Dave and Bob switch, so Dave is now a right winger!
* Then Claire and Alice switch, and Bob and Alice switch again, but Dave is still a right winger.
* Finally, Gertrude and Eve switch, but that doesn't change Dave's position either.


So the answer is **(B) right winger**. 
"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with which book!

It's like a big book swap party!  

* Gertrude and Dave trade, then Fred and Eve trade, then Gertrude and Bob trade.  
* Then Claire and Alice trade, and Eve and Claire trade again.
* Finally, Eve and Bob trade, and Bob and Alice trade.

After all that swapping, Fred ends up with **(B) Ulysses**. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a game of telephone, but with balls!  We need to see where Dave ends up.

*  He starts with purple.
*  Then he gets blue.
*  Then he gets brown.
*  Then he gets pink!

So the answer is **(G) pink ball**.

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

It's like a puzzle where everyone is switching partners.  

* Eve starts with Helga.
* Then Eve dances with Izzi, then Fred.

So the answer is **(A) Sam**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who ends up with what book.  

It's like a puzzle!

At the end, Dave is dancing with **(G) Rodrigo**. 


"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  They keep trading balls back and forth.  

Let's see... Fred starts with the pink ball. Then he trades with Eve, so he has the orange ball. Then he trades with Eve again and gets the pink ball back.  He trades with Alice and gets the white ball. Finally, he trades with Alice and gets the yellow ball.

So the answer is **(D) yellow ball**.

"
"Okay, so we have seven people, and they each start with a different colored ball.  Then they trade balls a bunch of times.  To figure out who ends up with which ball, we just have to keep track of who's got what after each trade.

* **Step 3:** Claire and Bob switch again. Now Bob has the brown ball and Claire has the blue ball.

So at the end, Alice has the **(B) black ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

* At first, Alice is with Karl, Bob is with Rodrigo, and Claire is with Patrick.
* Then Claire and Alice switch, so Alice is with Patrick and Claire is with Karl.
* Next, Bob and Alice switch, so Alice is with Bob and Bob is with Patrick.
* Finally, Alice and Claire switch again, so Alice is with Karl and Claire is with Bob.


So the answer is **(A) Karl**.

*  First, Claire has Moby Dick, but then she trades with Alice who has Ulysses.
*  Next, Claire trades Ulysses with Bob who had Catch-22.
*  Finally, Bob trades Ulysses with Alice, who had Catch-22.

So, at the end, Claire must have **Catch-22**!

* Finally, Claire and Bob trade again.  So Bob ends up with *The Fellowship of the Ring*.


The answer is **(B) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

* First, Alice and Claire swap. That means Claire now has *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Alice has *The Great Gatsby*.
* Then Alice and Bob swap. Now Alice has *Frankenstein*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, and Claire still has *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
* Finally, Claire and Bob swap.  Claire ends up with *Frankenstein*!


So the answer is **(C)**. 




"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

* Bob starts with Jamie.
* He switches with Alice, so now Bob is with Alice.
* Then Alice switches with Claire, so Bob is with Alice.
* Finally, Bob switches with Claire, so Bob is with Izzi. 


The answer is **(B) Izzi**. 
"
"Okay, so here's how it goes:

*  Alice starts as fullback, Claire is left winger, and Bob is cheering.
*  Alice and Claire switch, so now Alice is left winger and Claire is fullback.
*  Then Bob and Alice switch, so Bob is left winger and Alice is cheering.
*  Finally, Bob and Claire switch, so Bob is fullback and Claire is left winger.

That means at the end, Alice is cheering!  

So the answer is **(B)**. 


"
"Okay, so here's how the positions change:

* **Start:** Alice is in the middle, Bob is on the right, and Claire is in goal.
* **Swap 1:** Claire and Bob switch. Now Claire is on the right and Bob is in goal.
* **Swap 2:** Claire and Alice switch. Now Alice is on the right, Claire is in the middle, and Bob is still in goal.
* **Swap 3:** Claire and Bob switch again. Now Alice is on the right, Bob is in the middle, and Claire is in goal.


So at the end, Bob is playing **(A) center midfielder**. 
"
"Okay, so here's how the ball swaps go:

* **Swap 1:** Alice and Bob switch.  Alice gets the green ball, and Bob gets the yellow ball.
* **Swap 2:** Alice and Claire switch. Alice gets the blue ball, and Claire gets the green ball.
* **Swap 3:** Claire and Bob switch. Claire gets the yellow ball, and Bob gets the green ball.

So at the end, Claire has the **(C) yellow ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

*  Alice starts with Helga.
*  Bob starts with Lola.
*  Claire starts with Ophelia.

They switch partners a bunch, but here's the important part:

* Alice and Bob switch, then Bob and Claire switch, then Alice and Bob switch again.

That last switch means Bob ends up with Claire. 


So the answer is **(C) Ophelia**. 
"
"Okay, so Bob starts with Melissa, then he dances with Alice, then Claire, and then back to Alice again.  

The answer is **(A) Alice**. 


"
